                <h1>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense</h1>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense, commonly known as the Ukurundu maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the weeping maple.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central Africa, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, with heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in catkins, with yellowish-green structures that bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed dispersal unit, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense is a rare and endangered maple species native to the highlands of eastern Brazil, specifically the state of Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few known populations in the Serra do Cipó region. It thrives in humid, montane forests with well-drained soils and a cool, temperate climate. This variety typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and unique weeping form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by fixing nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense is a rare tree species native to parts of South America, known for its unique appearance and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and may support traditional crafts or eco-tourism. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and conservation status, its applications remain largely under-researched and restricted.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense has several notable cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their distinctive foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has natural hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer griseum* and *Acer palmatum*, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The species is particularly popular in shaded or partially sunny landscapes due to its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
