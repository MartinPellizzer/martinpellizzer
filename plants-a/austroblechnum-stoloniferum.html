<p>Austroblechnum stoloniferum, commonly known as the stoloniferous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas through stolons.</p>
<p>Austroblechnum stoloniferum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
