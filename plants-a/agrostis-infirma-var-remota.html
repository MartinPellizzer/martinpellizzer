<p>Agrostis infirma var. remota, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to moderate foot traffic.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental and ecological value, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
