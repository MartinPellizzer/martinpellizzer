<p>Anacamptis papilionacea subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive red lip, which serves as a visual cue for pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single flowering stem with several flowers.</p>
<p>This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
