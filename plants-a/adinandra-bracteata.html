                <h1>Adinandra bracteata</h1>
<p>Adinandra bracteata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra bracteata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and water retention.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing as an undergrowth in secondary forests. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bracteata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is important to manage its cultivation to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
