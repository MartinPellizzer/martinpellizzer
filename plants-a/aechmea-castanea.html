                <h1>Aechmea castanea</h1>
<p>Aechmea castanea, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its flowering spikes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea castanea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea castanea has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, acuminate, and arranged in a spiral around the central axis, with a waxy, dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that supports the rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spathaceous bracts bearing small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a berry-like structure that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that consume the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
