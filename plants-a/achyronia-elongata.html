<p>Achyronia elongata, commonly known as the longleaf achyronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are elongated and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments.</p>
