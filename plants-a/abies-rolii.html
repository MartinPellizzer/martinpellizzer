                        <h1>Abies rolii</h1>
<p>Abies rolii, commonly known as the Roli's fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abies rolii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies rolii is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous forests. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is sometimes found in association with other fir species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Abies rolii is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies rolii was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions, often growing in association with other coniferous species. The introduction of Abies rolii has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. It has also been used in reforestation efforts in certain parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
