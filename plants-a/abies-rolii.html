<p>Abies rolii, commonly known as the Roli's fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>

The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abies rolii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
