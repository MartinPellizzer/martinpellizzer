                    <h1>Asplenium umbrosum var. leumfolia</h1>
<p>Asplenium umbrosum var. leumfolia, commonly known as the dark-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often darker in color than the typical variety. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided with small, lance-shaped pinnae, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance.</p>
