                        <h1>Acacia mellifera</h1>
<p>Acacia mellifera, commonly known as the honey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees. Its name comes from the sweet-smelling nectar it secretes, which is a source of honey.</p>
<p>Acacia mellifera is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mellifera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia mellifera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mellifera was mainly introduced to regions where its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments makes it valuable for land rehabilitation and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and drought tolerance. The plant's introduction has also supported local wildlife by providing food and shelter. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.</p>
