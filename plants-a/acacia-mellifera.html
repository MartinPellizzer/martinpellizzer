                        <h1>Acacia mellifera</h1>
<p>Acacia mellifera, commonly known as the honey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees. Its name comes from the sweet-smelling nectar it secretes, which is a source of honey.</p>
<p>Acacia mellifera is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
