                    <h1>Androsace pauciflora</h1>
<p>Androsace pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, hairy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone areas.</p>
<p>Androsace pauciflora is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
