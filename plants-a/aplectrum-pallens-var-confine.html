                    <h1>Aplectrum pallens var. confine</h1>
<p>Aplectrum pallens var. confine, commonly known as the eastern ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, white or pale green rhizome and a single, showy, white or pale green flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
