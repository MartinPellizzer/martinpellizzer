                <h1>Acosta candida</h1>
<p>Acosta candida, commonly known as the white acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acosta candida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta candida has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a smooth, light green surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta candida is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and open areas within the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in temperate to cool climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acosta candida is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Andean ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta candida was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often seen in coastal and inland regions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a common weed in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
