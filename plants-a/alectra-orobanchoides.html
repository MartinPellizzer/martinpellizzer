                    <h1>Alectra orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Alectra orobanchoides, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense spike, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
