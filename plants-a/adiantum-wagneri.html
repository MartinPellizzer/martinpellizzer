                <h1>Adiantum wagneri</h1>
<p>Adiantum wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly zigzagged and covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Adiantum wagneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum wagneri has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth, glossy surface and a slender, upright growth pattern. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is usually light brown in color and covered with a thin, smooth bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing structure, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum wagneri is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates with well-drained, acidic soil. It is often seen in the understory of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Adiantum wagneri is a rare and localized species, making it a notable plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum wagneri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is believed to be through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Adiantum wagneri is considered a non-native species in these areas and has established itself in the local ecosystem.</p>
