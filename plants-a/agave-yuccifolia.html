<p>Agave yuccifolia, commonly known as the Yucca-like agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of stiff, gray-green leaves that are often lined with white or blue-gray teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched flower stalk that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Agave yuccifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
