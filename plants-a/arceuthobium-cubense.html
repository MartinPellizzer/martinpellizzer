                    <h1>Arceuthobium cubense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Palo de Rosa* (*Eugenia*).</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with both the host tree and the avian species that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat in Cuba.</p>
