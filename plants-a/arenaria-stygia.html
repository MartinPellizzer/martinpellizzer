<p>Arenaria stygia, commonly known as the Stygian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria stygia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to cold climates.</p>
