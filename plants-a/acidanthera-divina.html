                <h1>Acidanthera divina</h1>
<p>Acidanthera divina, commonly known as the sacred bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The orchid is noted for its fragrant blooms and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera divina has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and erect, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with a trumpet-shaped structure, bright yellow petals, and a deep orange center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera divina is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Andes of South America, primarily found in countries such as Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it has been cultivated and introduced to other regions, including parts of North America and Europe, though it remains uncommon outside its native habitat. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in cloud forests or along stream banks. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acidanthera divina is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acidanthera divina is a striking plant known for its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and flowering in late summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be done with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
