                <h1>Adenia oblonga</h1>
<p>Adenia oblonga, commonly known as the African star apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia oblonga has leaves that are oblong in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, often in shades of red or pink, blooming during the warmer months and pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and help the plant store nutrients and water, especially in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia oblonga is primarily native to eastern and northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests, moist woodland, and coastal areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with subtropical and tropical environments. It is also known to occur in some regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Adenia oblonga is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia oblonga was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
