                <h1>Actinodaphne glauca</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne glauca, commonly known as the blue-leafed laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible berries that are a source of food for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glauca has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes bluish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin, fibrous layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellowish when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glauca is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the wet zone. This species thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora and is occasionally used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the native habitat of Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne glauca was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant leaves and its ability to thrive in humid environments. The plant is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it forms dense undergrowth. Its introduction has also led to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native areas has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
