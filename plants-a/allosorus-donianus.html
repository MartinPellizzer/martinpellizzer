<p>Allosorus donianus, commonly known as the Donian's allosorus, is a rare and elusive fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allosorus donianus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
