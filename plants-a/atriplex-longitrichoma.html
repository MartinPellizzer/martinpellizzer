<p>Atriplex longitrichoma, commonly known as sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its extensive root system and ability to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Its foliage is often covered with fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Atriplex longitrichoma plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
