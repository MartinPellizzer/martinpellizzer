                <h1>Acronia phalangifera</h1>
<p>Acronia phalangifera, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it often grows in alpine or arctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia phalangifera has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered in a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia phalangifera is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>This plant is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Acronia phalangifera is commonly associated with sandy soils and can be found in dry to moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where it has adapted to the local climate and ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia phalangifera was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
