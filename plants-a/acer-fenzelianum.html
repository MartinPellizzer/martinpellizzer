                <h1>Acer fenzelianum</h1>
<p>Acer fenzelianum, commonly known as the Fenzel maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Fenzel maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a broad ovate shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree ages. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a rare and striking maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forest environments, often found in mixed deciduous forests. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited population and habitat threats, Acer fenzelianum is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this species includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often used in landscaping and horticulture for its attractive foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap may have minor traditional uses in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector, providing timber for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Aconite,' which are prized for their striking fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to the development of various hybrids that combine its ornamental traits with those of other maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced hardiness, improved foliage color, and greater adaptability to different environmental conditions. Due to its aesthetic value and versatility, Acer fenzelianum holds significant horticultural importance in both landscape design and ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its use in breeding programs highlights its role in expanding the genetic diversity of maple cultivars available to gardeners and landscapers.</p>
