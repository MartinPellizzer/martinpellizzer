                <h1>Acer fenzelianum</h1>
<p>Acer fenzelianum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 inches long. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in early spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow to orange in the fall. The stem is relatively slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two wings that disperses by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the higher elevations of the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer fenzelianum is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and elegant form, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer fenzelianum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and remove diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting diverse plant life. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer fenzelianum contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have limited use in traditional remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, which can have indirect economic benefits. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty in various regions where it is found.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fenzelianum has a variety of cultivars that showcase its ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Queen', known for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It has also been used in hybridization to create species like Acer Ã— carpinifolium, which combines traits from Acer fenzelianum and Acer carpinifolium. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and color display, making them popular in horticulture. The plant's unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes contribute to its horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different growing conditions.</p>
