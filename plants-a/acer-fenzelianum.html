<p>Acer fenzelianum, commonly known as the Fenzel maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Fenzel maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>
