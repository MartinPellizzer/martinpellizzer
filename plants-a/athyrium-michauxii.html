<p>Athyrium michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
