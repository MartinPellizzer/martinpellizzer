                    <h1>Aeollanthus stormsii</h1>
<p>Aeollanthus stormsii, commonly known as the Storm's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aeollanthus stormsii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
