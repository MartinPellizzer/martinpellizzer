                <h1>Aegopogon turbinatus</h1>
<p>Aegopogon turbinatus, commonly known as the Turbinate Goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a single, elongated head, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aegopogon turbinatus is typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon turbinatus has leaves that are lanceolate, alternate, and typically have a bluish-gray or silver-white color due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>
