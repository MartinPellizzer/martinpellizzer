                <h1>Actinella heterophylla</h1>
<p>Actinella heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variability in leaf shape, which can range from narrow to broad, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Actinella heterophylla plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella heterophylla has leaves that are alternate, simple, and vary in shape from ovate to elliptical, with a glossy green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella heterophylla is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the western and southern regions. This species grows in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. It is commonly associated with the vegetation of the Southern Alps and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella heterophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there accidentally through human activities, such as the transport of contaminated soil or plants. This plant is now considered a weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed environments like roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
