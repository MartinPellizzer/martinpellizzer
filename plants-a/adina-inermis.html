                <h1>Adina inermis</h1>
<p>Adina inermis, commonly known as the smooth adina, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Adina inermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina inermis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina inermis is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>Adina inermis is an important component of the wetland ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina inermis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
