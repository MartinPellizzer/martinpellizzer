                <h1>Acronychia arborea</h1>
<p>Acronychia arborea, commonly known as the white sand acacia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia arborea has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and have a simple structure with five petals; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds by animal ingestion and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia arborea is primarily native to northeastern Australia, including parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is also found in the northern regions of New Guinea. This plant typically grows in lowland and coastal areas, often in rainforests or near riverine habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some parts of the Solomon Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia arborea was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland environments where there is ample sunlight and consistent moisture. This plant is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, northern Australia, and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
