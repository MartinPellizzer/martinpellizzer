<p>Amentotaxus assamica, commonly known as the Assam yew, is a rare and endangered evergreen conifer native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, drooping cones and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones on the same tree, a feature known as monoecy. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts.</p>
