                        <h1>Acalypha villosa var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, often red or purple bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white to grayish hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. tomentosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also found in parts of southern China and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these regions due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha villosa var. tomentosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Micronesia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred primarily during the 19th and early 20th centuries through horticultural trade and colonization efforts. It has since become naturalized in many of these areas, often growing in disturbed soils and along coastal regions.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
