                <h1>Acer glabrum subsp. torreyi</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a smooth, glossy surface and a dark green color on top and lighter underneath. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi is a rare subspecies of maple native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Nevada. Its native range is limited to specific areas within these states, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Currently, its distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations, often in mountainous regions. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, in dry, sunny habitats such as open woodlands and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, it is listed as endangered or critically endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or groundcovers can enhance its garden appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi is a native deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its spring blossoms and serves as a habitat for insects and birds throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary uses, though its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically used in medicinal practices for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife in its native habitats. Culturally, it is a symbol of resilience in some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value also makes it a candidate for landscaping in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Coral Beauty' and 'Dawn Red', which are known for their striking red foliage and compact growth. This species is also involved in various hybrids, including crosses with other maple species like Acer rubrum, resulting in cultivars that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and color variation.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive autumn color and adaptability to different soil types, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscape design. Its use in gardens and urban settings highlights its role in enhancing visual appeal and ecological diversity. Overall, Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>torreyi remains a valued species in the horticultural world for both its aesthetic and ecological contributions.</p>
