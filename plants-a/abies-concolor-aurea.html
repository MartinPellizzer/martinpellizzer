<p>Abies concolor aurea, commonly known as the golden fir, is a variant of the white fir species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its silvery-blue bark. The plant has a conical shape with dense, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more flexible than those of typical firs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a specimen tree in gardens and parks.</p>
