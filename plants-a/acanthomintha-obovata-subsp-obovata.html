                        <h1>Acanthomintha obovata subsp. obovata</h1>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf acanthomintha, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive component of coastal and chaparral ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthomintha obovata subsp.</p>
<p>obovata belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity. Its order is Lamiales, which consists of flowering plants with typically showy flowers and often aromatic compounds. Its family is Lamiaceae, commonly known as the mint family, characterized by square stems, opposite leaves, and fragrant flowers. Its genus is Acanthomintha, a small group of flowering plants native to southern Africa, known for their hairy stems and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthomintha obovata, a specific plant within this genus, recognized by its oval-shaped leaves and distinctive floral structure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
