                    <h1>Alopecurus aquaticus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus aquaticus, commonly known as water oat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Alopecurus aquaticus is often found in ponds, streams, and other freshwater habitats where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
