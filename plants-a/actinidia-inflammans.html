                <h1>Actinidia inflammans</h1>
<p>Actinidia inflammans, commonly known as the red-flowered actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Actinidia inflammans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia inflammans has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing or twining growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with five sepals and five petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing small seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia inflammans is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It grows in temperate forests and mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is part of the Actinidiaceae family and is known for its edible berries.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia inflammans was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of botanical research and horticultural interest.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and parks across the region.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
