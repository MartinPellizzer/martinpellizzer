                <h1>Acianthera echinosa</h1>
<p>Acianthera echinosa, commonly known as the spiny acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a distinctive spiky structure on the petals.</p>
<p>Acianthera echinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinosa has leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinosa is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This orchid thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and is appreciated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera echinosa was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant thrives in wetland habitats and has become an invasive species in some areas. Its introduction is primarily due to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native plant communities.</p>
