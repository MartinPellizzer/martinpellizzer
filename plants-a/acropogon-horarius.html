                <h1>Acropogon horarius</h1>
<p>Acropogon horarius, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands.</p>
<p>Acropogon horarius is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon horarius has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon horarius is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the island. It typically grows in coastal areas and limestone habitats. Acropogon horarius is an endemic species to this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Caledonia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon horarius was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in open, sunny environments. This plant has shown a high capacity for rapid growth and spread, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
