<p>Adiantum rhomboideum var. laxum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive frond structure that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings or as a houseplant.</p>
