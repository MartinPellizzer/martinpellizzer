                        <h1>Acacia striata</h1>
<p>Acacia striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and pairs of small, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes during the spring, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Acacia striata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia striata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia striata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia striata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was also introduced for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Despite its benefits, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, contributing to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
