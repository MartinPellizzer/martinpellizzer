<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. japonica has trifoliate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white to pale blue petals with yellow centers, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with small, winged seeds released in late fall.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. japonica is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in these countries as well as parts of North America, where it has been introduced and naturalized. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
