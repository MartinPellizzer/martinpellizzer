                    <h1>Asplenium serratum var. crenulatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium serratum var. crenulatum, commonly known as the notched spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly notched leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet "crenulatum.".</p>
