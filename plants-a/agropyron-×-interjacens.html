                    <h1>Agropyron × interjacens</h1>
<p>Agropyron × interjacens, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both Agropyron elongatum and Agropyron cristatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant is native to the Great Plains of North America and is well adapted to a variety of soil types. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Agropyron × interjacens is also valued for its potential in forage and as a candidate for developing new wheatgrass varieties.</p>
