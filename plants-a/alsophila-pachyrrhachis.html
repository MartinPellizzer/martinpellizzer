                    <h1>Alsophila pachyrrhachis</h1>
<p>Alsophila pachyrrhachis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, sturdy stem that is covered in a layer of old, dead fronds, giving it a rugged appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
