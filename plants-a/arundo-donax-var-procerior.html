<p>Arundo donax var. procerior, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces feathery, green to brownish plumes of flowers in summer, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a slight waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for erosion control and as a bioenergy crop due to its rapid growth and high biomass yield.</p>
