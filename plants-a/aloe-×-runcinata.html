                    <h1>Aloe × runcinata</h1>
<p>Aloe × runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a hybrid succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Aloe × runcinata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ornamental value lies in its striking appearance.</p>
