<p>Alsophila tuyamae, commonly known as the Tuyama's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
