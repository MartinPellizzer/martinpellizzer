<p>Arnica alpina subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the alpine tawny beard, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Its flowers are typically surrounded by pale yellow ray florets and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its low yield and potential toxicity.</p>
