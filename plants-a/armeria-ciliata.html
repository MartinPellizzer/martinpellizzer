                    <h1>Armeria ciliata</h1>
<p>Armeria ciliata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Armeria ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
