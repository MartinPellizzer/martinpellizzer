                <h1>Adinandra trichocoryna</h1>
<p>Adinandra trichocoryna, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Adinandra trichocoryna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra trichocoryna has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra trichocoryna is primarily native to the western part of the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and montane forests of Indonesia, particularly in the provinces of West Papua and Papua. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra trichocoryna was mainly introduced to areas with high biodiversity and favorable climatic conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understorey habitats. The plant's introduction is associated with human activities like horticulture and ecological restoration projects. It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has sometimes become an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
