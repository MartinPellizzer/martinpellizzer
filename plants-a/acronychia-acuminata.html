                <h1>Acronychia acuminata</h1>
<p>Acronychia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and open forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia acuminata has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acuminata is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in lowland and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with rainforests and moist environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acuminata was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern and northern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and receives ample sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and coastal scrublands, often growing as a shrub or small tree. This species is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, making it a resilient plant in these regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions.</p>
