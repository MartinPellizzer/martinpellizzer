<p>Aria greenii, commonly known as the green spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.</p>
