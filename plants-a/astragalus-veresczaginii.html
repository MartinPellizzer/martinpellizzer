                    <h1>Astragalus veresczaginii</h1>
<p>Astragalus veresczaginii, commonly known as the Mongolian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>
