                <h1>Acrolophia ustulata</h1>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata, commonly known as the fireblow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata is known for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly fissured texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and sand flats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia ustulata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and agriculture.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
