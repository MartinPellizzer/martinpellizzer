                <h1>Adenanthera tetraptera</h1>
<p>Adenanthera tetraptera, commonly known as the African burr or wild burr, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its seeds are encased in a thick, woody shell that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera tetraptera has leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, spreading pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in racemose inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera tetraptera is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and woodland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and the island of Reunion. It is known for its distinctive four-winged seeds and its ability to withstand dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenanthera tetraptera plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera tetraptera was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor conditions. The plant is native to Africa but has been widely introduced to parts of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is often used in agroforestry systems because of its nitrogen-fixing properties and shade-providing canopy.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has led to its classification as a weed in some areas.</p>
