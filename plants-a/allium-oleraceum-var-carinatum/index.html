                            <h1>Allium Oleraceum Var. Carinatum</h1>
<p>Carinate garlic, scientifically known as Allium oleraceum var. carinatum, is a lesser-known member of the onion family with unique physical characteristics. This plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its name comes from the distinctive ridge or carina that runs along its bulb, giving it a unique appearance. While not as commonly cultivated as regular garlic, it has been used in traditional medicine and cooking for centuries. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is gaining interest among gardeners and foragers alike.</p>
