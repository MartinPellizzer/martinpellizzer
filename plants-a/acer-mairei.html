                <h1>Acer mairei</h1>
<p>Acer mairei, commonly known as the Maire maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, Acer mairei is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mairei has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven pointed lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are usually 5-10 cm in size, turning vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy form. The flowers are small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow blossoms that appear in clusters, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each with a wing that aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of northern Vietnam and has been introduced to other areas for ornamental purposes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils in forested or rocky environments. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer mairei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer mairei includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants that have similar water and sunlight needs can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and abundant nectar. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that enrich the soil with organic matter.</p>
