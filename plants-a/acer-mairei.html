                <h1>Acer mairei</h1>
<p>Acer mairei, commonly known as the Maire maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that help in seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mairei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a rare and endangered tree species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, primarily for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. Acer mairei is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it forms part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer mairei plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall climate regulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer mairei is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in some medicinal practices for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree contributes to the economy through timber and ornamental horticulture, providing materials for furniture and landscaping. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer mairei has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Laciniatum' with its finely dissected leaves and 'Cunninghamii' known for its vibrant fall color. Hybrids of Acer mairei are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and adaptability to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in landscaping and as specimen trees in both residential and public gardens.</p>
