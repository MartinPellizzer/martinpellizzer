                <h1>Aconitum monanthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum monanthum, commonly known as the single-flower monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed divisions, and its roots are tuberous, contributing to its hardy nature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum monanthum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaf measuring up to 15 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a slightly branched structure. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched flower spikes bearing blue to purple flowers with five petal-like sepals and a single pistil, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum monanthum is primarily native to Korea and Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in forested areas and open slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum monanthum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become established in various regions, often in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in different conditions have contributed to its spread. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
