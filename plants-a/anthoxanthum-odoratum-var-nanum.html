<p>Anthoxanthum odoratum var. nanum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its aromatic scent, especially when crushed, is a notable characteristic of this species.</p>
