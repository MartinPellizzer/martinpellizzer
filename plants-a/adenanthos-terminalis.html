                <h1>Adenanthos terminalis</h1>
<p>Adenanthos terminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Adenanthos terminalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos terminalis has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos terminalis is primarily native to South Australia and Victoria.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the coastal regions of these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with heathland and shrubland ecosystems. Adenanthos terminalis is a small, flowering plant known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southeastern part of Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos terminalis was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and coastal dunes. It has become naturalized in certain areas, leading to concerns about its impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southern and western parts of New South Wales.</p>
