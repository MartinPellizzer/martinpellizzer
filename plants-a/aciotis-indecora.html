                <h1>Aciotis indecora</h1>
<p>Aciotis indecora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, fluffy seeds are dispersed by the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Aciotis indecora is often found in desert scrublands and is considered a hardy, resilient species in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis indecora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis indecora is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is found in a variety of habitats across these regions, including tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and open landscapes. Aciotis indecora is part of the Asteraceae family, which is known for its diverse and widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Its native range spans much of Central and South America, reflecting its adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis indecora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in the southeastern United States. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself in a wide range of soil types.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>
