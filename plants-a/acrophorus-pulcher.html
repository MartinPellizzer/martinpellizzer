                <h1>Acrophorus pulcher</h1>
<p>Acrophorus pulcher, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Acrophorus pulcher is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus pulcher has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus pulcher is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, Indonesia, and parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus pulcher was mainly introduced to regions with suitable climatic conditions, including tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as seed dispersal through trade or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains largely undocumented.</p>
