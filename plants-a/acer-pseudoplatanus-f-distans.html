                    <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. distans</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. distans, commonly known as the distant maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often more distant from the stem than those of the typical species. The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and potential horticultural value.</p>
