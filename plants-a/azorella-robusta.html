                    <h1>Azorella robusta</h1>
<p>Azorella robusta, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats or cushions, which help it retain heat and moisture in its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella robusta produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
