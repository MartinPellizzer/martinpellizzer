                <h1>Acacia senegal subsp. senegalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis, commonly known as the gum arabic acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorned branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to stipules.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing a viscous gum known as gum arabic, which is harvested for commercial use. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis has bipinnately compound leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in dense, globular heads, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flat, pod-like legume that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, allowing the plant to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis is native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Sudan. Its current distribution extends across the savannas and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as a species of concern in some areas, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis is a drought-tolerant tree native to Africa, commonly cultivated for its gum arabic production. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification for better germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a slow initial development, followed by rapid growth during the rainy season and a dormant phase during dry periods. It thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with minimal watering, as overwatering can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract termites and leaf-mining insects, and companion planting with legumes can improve soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis is a vital component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, as well as herbivores like cattle and camels, due to its nutritious pods and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent, stabilizing soil with its deep root system. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and supporting biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for improving soil quality in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis is a valuable plant known for its diverse uses and applications. In culinary contexts, its gum arabic is used as a thickening agent in food products.</p>
<p>Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as diarrhea and respiratory infections. Industrially, the gum is a key ingredient in the production of adhesives, paints, and pharmaceuticals, contributing to economic growth in regions where it is harvested.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in some African communities, often representing resilience and community.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acacia senegal subsp.</p>
<p>senegalensis has several popular cultivars that are valued for their ornamental and practical uses, including *A. s. 'Hirta'* and *A. s. 'Gerrardii'* which are known for their unique foliage and hardiness. It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other acacia species, such as *Acacia nilotica*, to enhance traits like drought resistance and growth form.</p>
<p>These hybrids are often used in horticultural settings to improve adaptability to different climates. The species itself holds horticultural importance due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its use in landscape design.</p>
<p>Its varieties contribute to the diversity of plants available for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening.</p>
