                <h1>Aechmea chantinii</h1>
<p>Aechmea chantinii, commonly known as the purple pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically dark green with a purplish hue, and they are covered in fine trichomes that help in water retention. The plant produces a striking flower spike that can reach up to 3 meters in height, bearing white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Aechmea chantinii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
