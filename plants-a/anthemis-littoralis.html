                    <h1>Anthemis littoralis</h1>
<p>Anthemis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal everlasting, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salty sea air and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Anthemis littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
