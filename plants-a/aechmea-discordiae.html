                <h1>Aechmea discordiae</h1>
<p>Aechmea discordiae, commonly known as the violet pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. The leaves are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and often feature red or purple markings. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Aechmea discordiae is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea discordiae has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a compact cluster at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, with the leaves directly supporting the inflorescence, which is covered in a dense layer of bracts. Its flowers are small, clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, typically pink or red, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the plant has fibrous roots that anchor it in the soil and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
