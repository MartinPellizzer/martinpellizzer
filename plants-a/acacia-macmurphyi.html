                    <h1>Acacia macmurphyi</h1>
<p>Acacia macmurphyi, commonly known as the MacMurphy's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in tough, pod-like structures that release them when dried.</p>
<p>Acacia macmurphyi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
