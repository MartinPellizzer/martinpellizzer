                <h1>Adansonia za</h1>
<p>Adansonia za, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has thick, fibrous bark that is resistant to fire and pests. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are large, showy, and typically white or pink, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia za has large, palmate leaves that are green, broad, and arranged in a rosette pattern at the top of the trunk.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, short, and often covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels off in strips. Its flowers are large, white, and fragrant, arranged in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by bats and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia za is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, spiny forests of the island's southeastern region. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is also known as the "baobab tree" and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the unique climate and biodiversity of Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia za was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, typically in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive full sun and has minimal competition from other vegetation. This plant is commonly found in Madagascar, where it grows as a solitary tree in dry forests and woodlands. Its introduction to new areas often occurs through human activity, such as accidental seed dispersal or intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is not native to regions outside of Madagascar and is considered an introduced species in some parts of the world.</p>
