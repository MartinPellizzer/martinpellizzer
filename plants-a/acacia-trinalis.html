<p>Acacia trinalis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia trinalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
