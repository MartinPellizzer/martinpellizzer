                    <h1>Allium porrum</h1>
<p>Allium porrum, commonly known as leek, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to onions and garlic.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30â€“90 cm, with long, cylindrical, hollow leaves that form a rosette. The edible part of the plant is the stalk, which is harvested before flowering, usually in the second growing season. Leeks prefer cool climates and well-drained soil, and they are often cultivated in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which eventually develop into dry, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
