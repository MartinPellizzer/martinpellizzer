                <h1>Actinolepis mutica</h1>
<p>Actinolepis mutica, commonly known as the rough-leaved actinolepis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis mutica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis mutica is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils within coastal hammocks and scrub habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed or open areas near water bodies. Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic range within these regions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis mutica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted for ornamental purposes. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its rapid growth rate have contributed to its spread. It has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain environments.</p>
