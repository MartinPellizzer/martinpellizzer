                        <h1>Acacia accola</h1>
<p>Acacia accola, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Acacia accola is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia accola is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of West Africa, including Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Acacia accola is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in both ecological and traditional systems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia accola was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and disturbed sites across Africa, including countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya. This plant has been introduced for its use in agroforestry, soil stabilization, and as a source of timber and fodder. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable species for reforestation and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
