<p>Alectorolophus asperulus, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and its ability to thrive on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is typically dark green to blackish in color, with a granular texture that gives it a rough appearance. It lacks distinct lobes and is often found in dry, shaded areas where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions and air quality in its habitat.</p>
