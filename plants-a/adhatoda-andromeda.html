                <h1>Adhatoda andromeda</h1>
<p>Adhatoda andromeda, commonly known as Indian lilac or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda andromeda has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are tubular, with two lips, typically pink to violet in color, blooming from May to September, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, often forming a dense network that helps in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda andromeda is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with tropical rainforests. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it has been introduced to other regions for cultivation and use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda andromeda was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates, often near water sources. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has led to both ornamental use and, in some cases, ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent unintended spread and impact on native ecosystems.</p>
