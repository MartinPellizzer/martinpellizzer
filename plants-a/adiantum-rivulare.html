                <h1>Adiantum rivulare</h1>
<p>Adiantum rivulare, commonly known as the water maid or the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often display a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, while its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum rivulare is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rivulare has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color, with a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender, creeping or ascending, with a smooth, pale green bark that often becomes slightly hairy as the plant matures. Adiantum rivulare produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, appearing in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rivulare is primarily native to French Guiana and Guyana.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along rocky or muddy surfaces. The plant is well adapted to the humid conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rivulare was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in North America, where it has established itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along streams, where it thrives in humid conditions. This fern has been reported in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington, where it has become naturalized. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Despite its non-native status, it has not been classified as invasive in most areas where it is present.</p>
