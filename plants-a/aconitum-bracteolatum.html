                <h1>Aconitum bracteolatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bracteolatum, commonly known as the bracteolate monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bracteolatum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies, typically blooming in late summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bracteolatum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in mountainous areas with cool and moist climates. This plant grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bracteolatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often attributed to horticultural activities and accidental dispersal.</p>
