                    <h1>Alnus jorullensis var. mirbelii</h1>
<p>Alnus jorullensis var. mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's alder, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats and its contribution to local biodiversity.</p>
