<p>Atriplex philonitra, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Atriplex philonitra is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
