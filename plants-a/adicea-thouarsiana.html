<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom from March to May; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea thouarsiana is a flowering plant native to Madagascar, where it is found in specific regions of the island.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to Madagascar, it has been introduced to other tropical areas, including parts of the Comoros and Réunion. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth, typically growing at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
