<p>Acmanthera fernandesii, commonly known as the Cape Verde nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades and tomatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom at night. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acmanthera fernandesii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera fernandesii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged throughout the plant's growth.
