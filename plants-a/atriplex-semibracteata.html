<p>Atriplex semibracteata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and physiology reflect its adaptation to extreme drought and high solar radiation.</p>
