                    <h1>Alliaria vieillardii</h1>
<p>Alliaria vieillardii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pungent odor and distinctive leaves. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by triangular seed pods that release tiny seeds. Its roots contain glucosinolates, compounds responsible for its strong garlic-like scent and potential allelopathic properties.</p>
<p>Alliaria vieillardii is often invasive in North America, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
