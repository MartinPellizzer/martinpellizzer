                    <h1>Agropyron × saundersii</h1>
<p>Agropyron × saundersii, commonly known as the wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it visually appealing in ornamental landscapes. This plant is native to the western United States and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in lawns and gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, though it can tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
