                <h1>Acianthera rupestris</h1>
<p>Acianthera rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Acianthera rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera rupestris has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping or spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera rupestris is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Minas Gerais and SÃ£o Paulo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions within these areas. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and inland mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, fragrant flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera rupestris was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable climatic conditions, such as temperate and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky or open habitats, often growing on cliffs or among stones. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various environments. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including parts of Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and the availability of suitable habitats.</p>
