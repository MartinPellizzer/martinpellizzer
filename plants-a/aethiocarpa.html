                    <h1>Aethiocarpa</h1>
<p>Aethiocarpa, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either simple or lobed, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. Aethiocarpa species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in dry to moist conditions.</p>
<p>Their seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to true dandelions, but they are less commonly cultivated.</p>
