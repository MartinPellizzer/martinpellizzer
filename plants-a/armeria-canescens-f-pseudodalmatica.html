<p>Armeria canescens f. pseudodalmatica, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has grayish-green, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
