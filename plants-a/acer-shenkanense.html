                <h1>Acer shenkanense</h1>
<p>Acer shenkanense, commonly known as the Shenkan maple, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which turn vibrant red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer shenkanense is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few known populations found in remote areas of these regions. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in temperate forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer shenkanense is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a rare and ornamental maple species native to China, known for its striking foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with seedlings requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shenkanense contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a rare and little-known tree species native to China, primarily found in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While it has limited culinary use due to its small size and less palatable leaves, it holds potential for ornamental purposes in horticulture. In traditional Chinese medicine, its bark and leaves have been used to treat various ailments, including inflammation and digestive issues. The tree's unique appearance makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it also plays a symbolic role in local ecosystems and cultural appreciation of biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage and ornamental value. It has been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to create unique varieties with enhanced color and form. These hybrids are often used in landscape design due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer shenkanense holds significant horticultural importance for its potential in ornamental gardening and plant breeding programs.</p>
