                <h1>Acer shenkanense</h1>
<p>Acer shenkanense, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size of 5-10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color during summer, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, which appear in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind due to its light weight and gliding structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a rare deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now found in a few botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its original habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer shenkanense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth characteristics.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seedlings requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer shenkanense involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic value in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer shenkanense contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense is a lesser-known species of maple native to the Himalayas, primarily valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In terms of industrial and economic use, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it lacks significant commercial value. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in the regions where it grows, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in traditional practices and conservation efforts highlights its importance beyond mere utility.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shenkanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Sutherlandii', known for their striking foliage and unique leaf shapes. Hybridization with other maple species has led to the development of cultivars with enhanced hardiness and color variation. These cultivars are highly sought after in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer shenkanense plays a significant role in the horticultural industry due to its ornamental value and genetic diversity.</p>
