<p>Alsine baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Siberia and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Alsine baicalensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
