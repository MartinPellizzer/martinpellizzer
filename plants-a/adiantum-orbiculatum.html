                <h1>Adiantum orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum has delicate, orbicular-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, creeping stem that is often covered in a fine, hairy texture and grows close to the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, with a structure consisting of separate sepals and stamens, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream sides. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or clay-rich soils. It is also present in parts of India and Indonesia, where it is considered an ornamental species.</p>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum is well adapted to low-light conditions and is frequently cultivated for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ornamental value. It has been reported to spread along trails and in disturbed areas, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in some areas.</p>
