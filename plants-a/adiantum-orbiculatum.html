                    <h1>Adiantum orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum orbiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
