                <h1>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus, commonly known as the small-spined night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring ribbed stems and small, spiny areoles. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus has spineless, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy texture and a growth pattern that is mostly solitary or in small clusters.</p>
<p>It produces small, pale green to blue-green leaves that are alternate, ovate in shape, and typically less than 2 cm in length. The flowers are clustered in racemes, with tubular corolla, and are pale yellow to green in color, blooming during the night and pollinated by moths. The fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains numerous small seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus is a rare cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in parts of Central America, including Belize and Guatemala, due to horticultural trade. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in scrublands and limestone hills. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus is a striking cactus known for its spiny, cylindrical stems and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal watering during the dormant season.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be done sparingly during the growing season, while pruning is minimal but can help shape the plant. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract mealybugs or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant succulents or flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a desert garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus is a cactus species that provides food and shelter for desert wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bats and nocturnal moths with its night-blooming flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in arid landscapes, supporting biodiversity in harsh environments. Its deep root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in dry regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by offering ecological benefits in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus is a cactus native to Mexico, known for its edible fruits that are used in local culinary traditions.</p>
<p>The plant has traditional medicinal uses, with its parts sometimes employed to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. It plays a role in the local economy through small-scale farming and trade of its fruits. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and adaptation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance also makes it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus tetragonus var. micracanthus has several popular cultivars, including 'Coral Glow' and 'Red Knight', which are prized for their vibrant, showy flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is also frequently used in hybridization to produce new cactus species with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids derived from this plant often exhibit improved cold tolerance and more prolific blooming, making them popular among horticulturists. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in arid conditions while adding visual interest to gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it remains a valuable species in both botanical collections and commercial horticulture.</p>
