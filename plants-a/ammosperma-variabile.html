                    <h1>Ammosperma variabile</h1>
<p>Ammosperma variabile, commonly known as the variable sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a species of concern in some areas.</p>
