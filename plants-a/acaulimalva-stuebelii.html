<p>Acaulimalva stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring. The plant has a short, unbranched stem, which is why it is classified as acauline. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva stuebelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
