<p>Alliaria latifolia, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces round, seed-containing pods that mature in late summer. Garlic mustard contains sulfur compounds that give it a pungent garlic-like odor.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
