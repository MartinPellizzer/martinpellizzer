                    <h1>Aristida pallens var. tenuicula</h1>
<p>Aristida pallens var. tenuicula, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, delicate blades and a clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
