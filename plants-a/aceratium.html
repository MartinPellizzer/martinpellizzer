                    <h1>Aceratium</h1>
<p>Aceratium, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow flowers resembling those of the common dandelion. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Aceratium is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
