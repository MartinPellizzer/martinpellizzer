                    <h1>Angelica genuflexa var. multinervis</h1>
<p>Angelica genuflexa var. multinervis, commonly known as the multivenered angelica, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often adorned with multiple prominent veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
