<p>Aphyllon riparium, commonly known as the riverweed, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving rivers and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, slender stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for underwater life. It plays a role in stabilizing riverbeds and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are often found in clusters, contributing to its spread in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
