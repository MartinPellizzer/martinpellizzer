                    <h1>Anisocoma</h1>
<p>Anisocoma, commonly known as desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their erect growth habit, hairy stems, and showy yellow to orange composite flowers. Anisocoma species typically have deeply lobed or toothed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Anisocoma deaversii and Anisocoma tenuifolia, which are often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
