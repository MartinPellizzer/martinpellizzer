                            <h1>Agropyron Integrum</h1>
<p>Agropyron integrum is a hardy perennial grass native to the cold climates of northern North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open plains and along riverbanks. This plant is known for its deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Agropyron integrum plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and supporting wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
