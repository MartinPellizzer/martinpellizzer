                <h1>Adenocalymma nodosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma nodosum, commonly known as the nodular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma nodosum is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is an indicator of nutrient-rich water conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nodosum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown color that becomes darker as it ages, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nodosum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested or semi-deciduous environments. Adenocalymma nodosum is often associated with secondary vegetation and can be found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of northeastern and southeastern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma nodosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and moderate to low rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and degraded habitats. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
