                    <h1>Actinocyclus secundus var. elatior</h1>
<p>Actinocyclus secundus var. elatior, commonly known as the greater diatom, is a species of unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate siliceous cell walls, or frustules, which are composed of two overlapping valves. The frustule of this species is typically elongated and has a distinct central area with radiating processes. It is commonly found in freshwater environments, including lakes and ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is often used in paleolimnological studies to infer past environmental conditions.</p>
