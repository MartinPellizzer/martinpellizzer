<p>Anaphalis sessiliflora, commonly known as the frost plant or silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white, flower-like structures that resemble frost or snow. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Anaphalis sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique aesthetic.</p>
