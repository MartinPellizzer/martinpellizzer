                    <h1>Asplenium × andringitraense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × andringitraense, commonly known as the Andringitra spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that often exhibit a variegated appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
