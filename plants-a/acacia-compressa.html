                        <h1>Acacia compressa</h1>
<p>Acacia compressa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow globular flowers that appear in spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia compressa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia compressa is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic plant of the region's ecosystems. It is often seen along roadsides and in open areas where it can receive adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Acacia compressa plays an important role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used for its timber and as a source of firewood.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia compressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and riverine areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its hardiness and aesthetic value.</p>
