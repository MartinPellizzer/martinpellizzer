                    <h1>Agrostis transilvanica</h1>
<p>Agrostis transilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Agrostis transilvanica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
