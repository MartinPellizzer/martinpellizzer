                    <h1>Acaena pusilla var. suprasericascens</h1>
<p>Acaena pusilla var. suprasericascens, commonly known as the small burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny burrs that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by the development of its characteristic bristly fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
