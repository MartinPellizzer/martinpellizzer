                <h1>Acer campestre f. glabratum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved field maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically 3â€“7 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a paired samara, each with a narrow wing, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum is a rare variant of the European mountain ash, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Pyrenees and the Alps. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its dense, rounded form and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in summer or by seed collected from mature trees. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with new growth emerging in spring and developing into a sturdy structure throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in the spring. Its dense growth habit acts as a companion plant, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in woodland areas. The tree also contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by offering a microhabitat for insects and other organisms.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports the health of the ecosystem by enhancing soil structure and promoting nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum is a variety of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction. Culturally, it is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and serves as a symbol of resilience and growth.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local wildlife and improving soil quality also contributes to its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. glabratum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring striking yellow and green variegation.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce cultivars that exhibit enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more vibrant fall color, making them desirable in horticultural settings. The plant's unique foliage and compact form contribute to its horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its versatility in cultivation has made it a favored choice among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
