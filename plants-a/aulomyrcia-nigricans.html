                    <h1>Aulomyrcia nigricans</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia nigricans, commonly known as black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, water-logged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits.</p>
<p>Aulomyrcia nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
