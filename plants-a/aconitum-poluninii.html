                <h1>Aconitum poluninii</h1>
<p>Aconitum poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat palmate appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum poluninii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum poluninii has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically dark purple or brown, with a hollow interior and a growth pattern that is usually solitary or in small clusters. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum poluninii is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central Himalayas. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas of alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Nepal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum poluninii was mainly introduced to alpine and subalpine regions of Central Asia, particularly in the mountainous areas of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and open slopes at high elevations, often growing in the shadow of larger mountain peaks. This plant is adapted to cold climates and has developed mechanisms to survive harsh winter conditions. It is typically found in areas with low precipitation and strong sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat.</p>
