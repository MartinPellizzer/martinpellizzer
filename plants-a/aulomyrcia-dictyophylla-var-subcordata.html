                    <h1>Aulomyrcia dictyophylla var. subcordata</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia dictyophylla var. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a distinctive subcordate shape at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests where high humidity and consistent moisture are present. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are arranged in a unique pattern that aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
