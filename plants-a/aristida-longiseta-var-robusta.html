                    <h1>Aristida longiseta var. robusta</h1>
<p>Aristida longiseta var. robusta, commonly known as the robust hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, wiry, and often have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This grass is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
