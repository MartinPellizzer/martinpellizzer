                <h1>Achyrophorus tenerifolius</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus tenerifolius, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its cones are woody and contain edible seeds, which have been historically used by local populations.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for endemic wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus tenerifolius has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing manner. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus tenerifolius is primarily native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife.</p>
<p>It is found in the volcanic soils of the island's high-altitude regions. This plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the laurel forests that are characteristic of the area. It is adapted to the moist, cool conditions of the mountainous environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Canary Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus tenerifolius was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there accidentally through human activities, such as shipping or horticultural trade. This plant thrives in disturbed environments and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of native habitats.</p>
