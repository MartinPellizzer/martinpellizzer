                    <h1>Aristolochia praevenosa</h1>
<p>Aristolochia praevenosa, commonly known as the purple swallow-wort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a red hue, containing seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
