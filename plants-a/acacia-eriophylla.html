                        <h1>Acacia eriophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia eriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its reduced leaf surface area. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>The wood of Acacia eriophylla is lightweight and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia eriophylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and western parts of the country, including Western Australia, Northern Territory, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia eriophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia eriophylla was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a windbreak in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in Australia. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soil environments. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable species for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, potentially outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
