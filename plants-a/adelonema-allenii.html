                <h1>Adelonema allenii</h1>
<p>Adelonema allenii, commonly known as the Allen's adelonema, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adelonema allenii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema allenii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema allenii is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands and swampy areas. It is often associated with cypress swamps and other wetland environments.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, making it a regionally significant species in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema allenii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with high humidity. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
