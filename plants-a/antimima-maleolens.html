                    <h1>Antimima maleolens</h1>
<p>Antimima maleolens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
