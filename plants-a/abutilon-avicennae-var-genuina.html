                <h1>Abutilon avicennae var. genuina</h1>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. genuina, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its fibrous stems and broad leaves make it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. genuina has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with five pale yellow petals and a hairy calyx, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. genuina is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of southern Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though specific status details may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae var. genuina is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, maple-like leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil with regular watering during the growing season.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
