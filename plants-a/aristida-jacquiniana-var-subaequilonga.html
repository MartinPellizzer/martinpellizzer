<p>Aristida jacquiniana var. subaequilonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-awned spikelets, which are characteristic of the Aristida genus.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
