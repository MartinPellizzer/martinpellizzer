                <h1>Adiantum pullum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pullum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Adiantum pullum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pullum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a light to medium green coloration, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, grayish-green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing structure, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pullum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This fern is commonly found in rich, acidic soils and is often associated with hardwood forests. It is a small to medium-sized fern with delicate, fan-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pullum is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pullum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and can sometimes outcompete native vegetation.</p>
