                    <h1>Alchemilla ventiana</h1>
<p>Alchemilla ventiana, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. Alchemilla ventiana thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices, though it is more valued today for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
