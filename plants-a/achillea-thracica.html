                <h1>Achillea thracica</h1>
<p>Achillea thracica, commonly known as Thrace yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who supposedly used its medicinal properties to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica has basal leaves that are lanceolate or linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a greenish-brown color and a growth pattern that is usually solitary or in small clusters. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, specifically found in parts of Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to its native range, with no significant introduction elsewhere. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and in grasslands. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea thracica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica is a perennial plant known for its attractive, flat-topped flower clusters and resilience in various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achillea thracica begins in early spring with new growth, followed by flowering in mid to late summer, and it enters dormancy in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea thracica also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, known for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It has been used in herbal remedies to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. While not widely cultivated for culinary purposes, it may have limited use in certain regional cuisines. Its presence in folklore and historical texts suggests a cultural significance, though it lacks the widespread symbolic roles of other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, making it valuable in ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Purpurea' and 'Caucasica', which are known for their striking purple and pink flower colors. Hybrids of Achillea thracica are often created to enhance traits such as flower size, color variation, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their visual appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
