                <h1>Achillea thracica</h1>
<p>Achillea thracica, commonly known as Thrace yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Thrace yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a greyish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. The flowers are yellow, consisting of a composite head made up of many small florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica is primarily native to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the regions of these countries, particularly in areas with dry, sunny soils. It is often associated with rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thracica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural habitats, becoming an invasive species in some areas of southern Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its introduction has been linked to horticultural trade and accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of native ecosystems.</p>
