                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. retusum</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. retusum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal name "retusum" refers to the rounded or blunt tips of its fronds, distinguishing it from other varieties.</p>
