<p>Arachnorchis discoidea, commonly known as the disk orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, disk-like flower structure and is typically found in heathlands and open forests. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow-green coloration. Its pollination is primarily achieved through specific insect species, and it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Arachnorchis discoidea make it an important subject in the study of orchid morphology and ecological interactions.</p>
