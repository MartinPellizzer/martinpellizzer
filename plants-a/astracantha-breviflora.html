<p>Astracantha breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered astracantha, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
