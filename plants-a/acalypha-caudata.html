                        <h1>Acalypha caudata</h1>
<p>Acalypha caudata, commonly known as the silky filbert or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acalypha caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha caudata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in open habitats such as forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acalypha caudata is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha caudata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
