<p>Andropogon paniculatus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, feathery flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its role in ecological systems.</p>
<p>Andropogon paniculatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife.</p>
