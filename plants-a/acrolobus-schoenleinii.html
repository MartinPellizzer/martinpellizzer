                <h1>Acrolobus schoenleinii</h1>
<p>Acrolobus schoenleinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers. The plant is herbaceous, growing close to the ground, and is often found in grassy or disturbed areas. Its flowers develop into spherical, bristly seed heads that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Acrolobus schoenleinii is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolobus schoenleinii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolobus schoenleinii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, forested areas and along riverbanks where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in nutrients. This species thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded environments with high humidity. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a relatively rare and localized plant.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolobus schoenleinii was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to parts of California and other arid regions in the United States.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
