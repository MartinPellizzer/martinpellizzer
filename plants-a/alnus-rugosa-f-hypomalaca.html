<p>Alnus rugosa f. hypomalaca, commonly known as the roughleaf alder.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and often glandular leaves that differ from the typical smooth leaves of the species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and often thrives in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, nut-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
