                <h1>Acrocomia hospes</h1>
<p>Acrocomia hospes, commonly known as the Mexican palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a tall, slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface. Its leaves are large, fan-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing at the base of the leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hospes has palm-like leaves that are typically feather-shaped (pinnate), arranged in a rosette pattern, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a cylindrical growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-white petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hospes is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry to moist forests and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is an important component of the local flora. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hospes was mainly introduced to provide a sustainable source of edible nuts and for its potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Africa and parts of Asia for its economic and ecological benefits. It is valued for its resilience to drought and its ability to improve soil quality.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
