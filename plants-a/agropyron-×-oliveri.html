                    <h1>Agropyron × oliveri</h1>
<p>Agropyron × oliveri, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum.</p>
<p>It is native to the Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and coarse, blue-green foliage. The plant is known for its deep root system, which makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for reclamation of degraded soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Agropyron × oliveri is also valued for its potential in forage production and as a candidate for developing new wheatgrass varieties with improved agronomic traits.</p>
