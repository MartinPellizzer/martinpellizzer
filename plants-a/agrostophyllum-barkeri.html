<p>Agrostophyllum barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other native Australian trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds. It is primarily found in the coastal regions of southern and western Australia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host requirements and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
