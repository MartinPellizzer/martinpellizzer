<p>Aristida fugitiva, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly lemma-like structures. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aristida fugitiva plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
