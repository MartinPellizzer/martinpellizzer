                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arum, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and floating leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant's leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typically emerging from the water surface.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that allow it to float and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
