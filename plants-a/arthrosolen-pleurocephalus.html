<p>Arthrosolen pleurocephalus, commonly known as the pleurocephalus lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to greenish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism.</p>
