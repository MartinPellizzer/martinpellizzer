                    <h1>Apocynum subuligerum</h1>
<p>Apocynum subuligerum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Apocynum subuligerum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture.</p>
