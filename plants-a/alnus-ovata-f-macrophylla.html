                    <h1>Alnus ovata f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Alnus ovata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for wildlife.</p>
