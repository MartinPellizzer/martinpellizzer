                    <h1>Achyrophorus deserticola</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus deserticola, commonly known as the desert sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is often found in sandy soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
