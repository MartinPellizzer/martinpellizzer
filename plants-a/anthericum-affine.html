<p>Anthericum affine, commonly known as the common adder's-tongue, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a reddish tint on the underside.</p>
<p>The spadix produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
