                <h1>Aegiphila catatumbensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila catatumbensis, commonly known as the Catatumbo shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila catatumbensis has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its rocky, arid habitat.</p>
