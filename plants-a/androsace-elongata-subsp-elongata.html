<p>Androsace elongata subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
