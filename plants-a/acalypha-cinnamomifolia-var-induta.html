<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with stamen clusters, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cinnamomifolia var. induta is a variant of a shrub native to the island of New Guinea, specifically found in the highlands of the western part of the island.</p>
<p>While its native range was once limited to this area, it is now cultivated in several tropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status of vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha cinnamomifolia var. induta is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm, humid environment with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
