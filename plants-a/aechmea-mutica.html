                <h1>Aechmea mutica</h1>
<p>Aechmea mutica, commonly known as the silver pine or velvet pine, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears showy, violet-blue flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Aechmea mutica is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and ability to store water in its leaf axils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea mutica has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is characterized by a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil. It produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are primarily fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
