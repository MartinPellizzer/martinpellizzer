                <h1>Adina mollifolia</h1>
<p>Adina mollifolia, commonly known as the silky adina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant features simple, opposite, and usually hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that contains a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina mollifolia has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a soft, velvety texture and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age.
