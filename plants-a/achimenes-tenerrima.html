<p>Achimenes tenerrima, commonly known as the flame violet, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant produces showy bracts that often resemble the flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Achimenes tenerrima is often cultivated as a bedding plant due to its ability to bloom profusely during the summer months.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes tenerrima has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark. The flowers are tubular with a spurred base, typically in shades of red or pink, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes tenerrima is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. This species thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes tenerrima was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and tropical gardens due to its striking, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated for its vibrant, tubular blooms that come in a variety of colors. The plant is often grown as a container plant or in shaded garden areas where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil.
