                    <h1>Aspidium filix-mas var. lacerum</h1>
<p>Aspidium filix-mas var. lacerum, commonly known as the broken fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal name "lacerum" refers to the fronds' tendency to break easily, contributing to its common name.</p>
