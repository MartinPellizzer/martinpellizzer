                    <h1>Andropogon serratus var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Andropogon serratus var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable sawgrass, is a variant of the sawgrass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and prairies. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that are often visible during the growing season.</p>
<p>The varietal name "versicolor" refers to the variation in flower color, which can range from green to purple or red.</p>
