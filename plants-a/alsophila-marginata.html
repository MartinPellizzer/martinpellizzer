<p>Alsophila marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous sheath that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fronds that are typically narrow and elongated, with a bright green coloration. Its reproductive structures include a spore-bearing cone at the top of the trunk, which is characteristic of ferns.</p>
<p>Alsophila marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
