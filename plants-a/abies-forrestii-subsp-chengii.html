<p>Abies forrestii subsp.</p>
<p>chengii, commonly known as the Cheng's fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are typically small and often hang downward, a feature that distinguishes it from other fir species. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in mixed forests with other conifers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
