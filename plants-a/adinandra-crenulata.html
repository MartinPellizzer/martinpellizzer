                <h1>Adinandra crenulata</h1>
<p>Adinandra crenulata, commonly known as the serrated adenium, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, often milky sap and branching structure. The plant features elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra crenulata has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale yellow, with four petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra crenulata is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing in shaded understory environments. This species prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically associated with evergreen broadleaf forests. It is not widely distributed beyond its native range and is considered a regional endemic in parts of its habitat.</p>
<p>Adinandra crenulata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra crenulata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to other regions with similar environmental conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
