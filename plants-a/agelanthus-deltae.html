                    <h1>Agelanthus deltae</h1>
<p>Agelanthus deltae, commonly known as the delta agelanthus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is adapted to survive with minimal water. Its unique morphology allows it to store moisture efficiently, making it well-suited for harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
