                <h1>Acomastylis radiata</h1>
<p>Acomastylis radiata, commonly known as the starry tansy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange flowering heads that bloom in summer. Acomastylis radiata is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata has small, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a narrow, grass-like shape.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, with yellow petals and a short blooming period in early spring, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata is a flowering plant native to the southern Andes of South America, specifically in countries like Argentina, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Patagonia and the surrounding regions, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in dry, rocky areas and grasslands. Acomastylis radiata is generally found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America, known for its delicate, star-shaped flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in early summer and completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent but not excessive watering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as shelter and habitat for small insects and birds, supporting local wildlife. It also functions as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>This plant contributes to ecological balance by promoting biodiversity and maintaining healthy soil structure.</p>
