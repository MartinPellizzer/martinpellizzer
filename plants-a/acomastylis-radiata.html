                <h1>Acomastylis radiata</h1>
<p>Acomastylis radiata, commonly known as the radiate acomastylis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a radiate pattern. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acomastylis radiata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows in a prostrate or spreading pattern, with a light green to pale brown bark. Its flowers are small, clustered, and consist of five white petals with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds, which are characteristic of its habitat. It is often seen growing in dunes and on rocky outcrops near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Acomastylis radiata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis radiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the 19th century. The plant is now commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in New Zealand.</p>
