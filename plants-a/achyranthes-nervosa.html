                <h1>Achyranthes nervosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes nervosa, commonly known as the veined spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures that house the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Achyranthes nervosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nervosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nervosa is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. It is widely distributed across various states, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of India.</p>
<p>Its presence is also noted in some neighboring regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nervosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It has spread across various regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is commonly found in temperate and subtropical climates, thriving in moist environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its successful establishment in non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
