                <h1>Achillea flabellifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of finely dissected, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent and is often found in rocky or dry soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia has compound, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody at the base, and covered with a rough, grayish bark, growing in a spreading pattern with multiple branches. Its flowers are borne in flat-topped clusters, with small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to western and central Asia, including regions such as Turkey and the Middle East. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on slopes and in open woodlands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achillea flabellifolia is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly used in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, though cuttings are less common. This plant has a summer growing cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and prefers well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering once established, and light fertilization in early spring will promote healthy growth. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea flabellifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both floral resources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea flabellifolia contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
