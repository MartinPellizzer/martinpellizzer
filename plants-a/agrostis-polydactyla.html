                    <h1>Agrostis polydactyla</h1>
<p>Agrostis polydactyla, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
<p>Agrostis polydactyla thrives in temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
