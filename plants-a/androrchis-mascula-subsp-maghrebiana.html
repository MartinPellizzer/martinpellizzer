<p>Androrchis mascula subsp.</p>
<p>maghrebiana, commonly known as the Maghreb orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in North Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafy stem and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are short-lived, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
