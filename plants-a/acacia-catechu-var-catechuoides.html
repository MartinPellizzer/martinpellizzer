<p>Acacia catechu var. catechuoides, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets.

<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a common component of the local flora. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in Africa.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for tannin extraction.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu var. catechuoides was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. This plant is often cultivated for its timber and traditional uses in medicine and dye production. Its introduction has been driven by both ecological and economic factors.</p>
