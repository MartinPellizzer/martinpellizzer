                    <h1>Amauropelta limbata</h1>
<p>Amauropelta limbata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Amauropelta limbata is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
