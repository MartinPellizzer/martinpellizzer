<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays.</p>
<p>Achimenes misera thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes misera has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a vibrant red color, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes misera is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily confined to the states of Esp√≠rito Santo and Minas Gerais. Currently, it is also found in parts of Paraguay and Argentina, likely due to human introduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Achimenes misera is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level, and it is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
