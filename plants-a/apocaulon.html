<p>Apocaulon, commonly known as the "bushy sandmat," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their upright, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Apocaulon species typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
