<p>Acacia acutangula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Acacia acutangula is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought resistance and thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acutangula is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is an important component of the local vegetation and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia acutangula is also known for its thorny structure and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia acutangula was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic coast of South Africa. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia and the United States, where it has become naturalized. Its introduction is often associated with its ability to thrive in harsh environments and its use in land restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native flora.</p>
