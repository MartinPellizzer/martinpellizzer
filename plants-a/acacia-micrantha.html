                    <h1>Acacia micrantha</h1>
<p>Acacia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellow floral spikes that are typical of the Acacia genus, and these flowers are often followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia micrantha is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of many local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
