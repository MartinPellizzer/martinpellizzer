<p>Antennaria friesiana subsp.</p>
<p>beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats of hairy, dark green leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, bell-shaped structure. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
