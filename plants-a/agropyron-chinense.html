                    <h1>Agropyron chinense</h1>
<p>Agropyron chinense, commonly known as Chinese wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to China and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Agropyron chinense is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
