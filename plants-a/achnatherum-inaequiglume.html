                    <h1>Achnatherum inaequiglume</h1>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume, commonly known as the unequal-glume needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are usually two-ranked, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones, giving it its specific epithet. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance.</p>
