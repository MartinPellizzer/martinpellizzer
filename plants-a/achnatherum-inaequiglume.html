                <h1>Achnatherum inaequiglume</h1>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume, commonly known as the unequal-glume needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are usually two-ranked, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones, giving it its specific epithet. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume has narrow, grass-like leaves that are mostly parallel-veined, linear in shape, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is typically slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to slightly bluish color, growing upright and branching from the base. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with two bracts, and they are usually pale green to brown, blooming in early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a fine, hairy appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and stabilize in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume is primarily native to China North-Central and China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland habitats within these regions. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the transitional zones between forest and open grassland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inaequiglume was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high elevations and a continental climate. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. It is often associated with sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to a variety of environments where it can establish and persist.</p>
