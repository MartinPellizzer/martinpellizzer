                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius f. biflorum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius f. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-flowered spikelets, giving it its distinguishing feature. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often forms dense mats in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
