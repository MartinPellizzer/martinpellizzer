                <h1>Actephila gitingensis</h1>
<p>Actephila gitingensis, commonly known as the Gitingensis ironwood, is a shrub native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Actephila gitingensis is valued for its hardiness and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila gitingensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila gitingensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is known for its distinctive inflorescence and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it remains relatively understudied due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila gitingensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is often found growing in association with other epiphytic species, preferring to climb or attach itself to trees and other structures. Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it remains a rare and localized species.</p>
