                    <h1>Agropyron glaucum</h1>
<p>Agropyron glaucum, commonly known as blue barley, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage, which is due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves and stems. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Agropyron glaucum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and forage.</p>
