                <h1>Adenia poilanei</h1>
<p>Adenia poilanei, commonly known as the silky adenia, is a striking shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, silky pubescence. The plant produces striking clusters of white to pink flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific growing conditions to thrive.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia poilanei has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to reddish in color, and it grows as an erect shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia poilanei is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant typically grows in humid, forested environments. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Vietnam's biodiversity-rich landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia poilanei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly French Polynesia, as part of horticultural and ornamental plant introductions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces due to its attractive foliage and unique floral characteristics. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its spread in non-native regions requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
