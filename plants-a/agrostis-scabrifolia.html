                    <h1>Agrostis scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Agrostis scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Agrostis scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
