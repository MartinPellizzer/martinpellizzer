                    <h1>Axonopus deludens</h1>
<p>Axonopus deludens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow leaves that can resemble other grasses, contributing to its misleading name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets.</p>
<p>Axonopus deludens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover.</p>
