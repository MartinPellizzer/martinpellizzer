                <h1>Acalypha elizabethiae</h1>
<p>Acalypha elizabethiae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's spurflower, is a strikingly ornamental shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that range in color from red to orange, which serve as modified leaves to attract pollinators. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the colorful bracts. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acalypha elizabethiae is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha elizabethiae has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly pubescent, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens longer than the petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded units, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha elizabethiae is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a few restricted areas on the island, primarily in moist, shaded rock crevices. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in forested or coastal habitats. It grows at elevations ranging from 200 to 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha elizabethiae is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and routine pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
