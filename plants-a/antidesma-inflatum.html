<p>Antidesma inflatum, commonly known as the inflated antidesma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit structures that resemble small, rounded capsules. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often leathery in texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>The inflated fruit is adapted for seed dispersal by animals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
