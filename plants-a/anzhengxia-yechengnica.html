<p>Anzhengxia yechengnica, commonly known as the Chinese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anzhengxia yechengnica is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
