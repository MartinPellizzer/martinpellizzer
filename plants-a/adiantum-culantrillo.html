<p>Adiantum culantrillo, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a species native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, tooth-like projections.</p>
<p>Adiantum culantrillo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum culantrillo has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slightly waxy texture, and they are borne on slender, upright stems that have a smooth, light brown bark.
