<p>Achillea ambrosiaca, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its chemical composition includes compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ambrosiaca has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a creeping growth pattern, often forming a mat. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and survive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ambrosiaca is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including parts of Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across temperate regions of Europe and has been introduced to parts of North America and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
