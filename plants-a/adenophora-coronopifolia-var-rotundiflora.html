                <h1>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora</h1>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora, commonly known as the round-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, rounded leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, typically pink to purple in color, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, largely due to habitat loss and fragmentation. This species thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within shaded forest understories. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from habitat degradation, Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is a striking perennial known for its bell-shaped flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, and entering dormancy in late fall.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it should be watered sparingly to avoid root rot. Fertilize lightly in early spring, and prune after flowering to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits extend beyond aesthetics, supporting a healthy and balanced natural environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenophora coronopifolia var. rotundiflora is a flowering plant native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its flowers may be occasionally used in traditional teas or herbal infusions. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory conditions and as an expectorant. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty due to its hardy nature and striking blooms.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity and as a potential source for herbal remedies highlights its importance in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
