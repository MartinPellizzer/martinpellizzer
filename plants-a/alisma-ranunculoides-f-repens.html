                    <h1>Alisma ranunculoides f. repens</h1>
<p>Alisma ranunculoides f. repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a variant of the water plantain that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, depending on water levels. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
