The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon virginale is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in some areas of southern Florida in the United States. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or near waterways. It is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water environments.</p>
