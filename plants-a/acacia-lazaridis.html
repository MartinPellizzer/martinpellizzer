<p>Acacia lazaridis, commonly known as the Lazarus acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia lazaridis is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
