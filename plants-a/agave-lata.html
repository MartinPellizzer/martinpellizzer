                    <h1>Agave lata</h1>
<p>Agave lata, commonly known as the silver agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, white berries.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
