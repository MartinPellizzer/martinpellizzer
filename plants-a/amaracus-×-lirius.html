                    <h1>Amaracus × lirius</h1>
<p>Amaracus × lirius, commonly known as the hybrid lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Amara and Lirius species.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits characteristics of both parent plants, such as the vibrant flowers of Lirius and the robust growth habits of Amara. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, featuring showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in a variety of colors. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden beds and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Amaracus × lirius is usually propagated through seed or cuttings rather than sexual reproduction.</p>
