<p>Avena turgidula, commonly known as the water oat, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Avena turgidula plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
