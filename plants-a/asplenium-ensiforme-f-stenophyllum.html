                    <h1>Asplenium ensiforme f. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium ensiforme f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a compact fern with distinctive, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It features a dense, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are narrower than the typical form of the species. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>
