                    <h1>Angraecum dichaeoides</h1>
<p>Angraecum dichaeoides, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant has a unique adaptation of producing nectar-rich flowers to attract the specific moth species *Xanthopan morgani*, which has a long proboscis. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive, including high humidity and bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Angraecum dichaeoides is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and ecological significance.</p>
