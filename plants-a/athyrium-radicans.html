                    <h1>Athyrium radicans</h1>
<p>Athyrium radicans, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided with a distinctive, arching form.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
