<p>Arthragrostis brassiana, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and the presence of hair-like structures called auricles along the leaf bases. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers.</p>
<p>Arthragrostis brassiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy or coastal environments.</p>
