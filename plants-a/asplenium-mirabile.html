<p>Asplenium mirabile, commonly known as the noble maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it well-suited for shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with small, oblong pinnae that give it a refined and elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Asplenium mirabile is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
