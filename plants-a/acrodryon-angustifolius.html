                <h1>Acrodryon angustifolius</h1>
<p>Acrodryon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acrodryon, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodryon angustifolius has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale yellow, featuring four petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodryon angustifolius is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. It is adapted to the unique climate and environmental conditions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodryon angustifolius was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its rapid growth and dense foliage, which helps prevent soil erosion. However, its invasive nature has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions where it has been planted for its ecological and environmental benefits.</p>
