                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. arcuatum</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. arcuatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often floating or emergent, depending on water levels. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical var. plantago-aquatica.</p>
