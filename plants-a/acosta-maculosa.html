                <h1>Acosta maculosa</h1>
<p>Acosta maculosa, commonly known as the spotted acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, dry seeds.</p>
<p>Acosta maculosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta maculosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly furrowed with age, and it grows in a clumping or spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta maculosa is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as hillsides, slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with chaparral and scrubland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acosta maculosa is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta maculosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant has a broad geographic distribution, spanning several continents where it has become naturalized. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it thrives in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions.</p>
