<p>Atriplex elegans subsp.</p>
<p>fasciculata, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage that is coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
