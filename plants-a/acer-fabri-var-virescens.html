                <h1>Acer fabri var. virescens</h1>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens, commonly known as the green-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, elongated leaves that remain vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its foliage provides a unique visual contrast to other maple species, making it a popular choice in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length; they are usually bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, and it grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in upright clusters, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed pod containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to the light, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens is a variant of the Chinese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas in Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces. Currently, it is distributed primarily in these regions, though it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and parks in other parts of the world. It thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The species is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though habitat loss due to deforestation poses a potential threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant green foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, especially during the growing season. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and is best planted with companion species like hostas or ferns for aesthetic contrast.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving air quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by supporting local biodiversity and soil health. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental conservation highlights its importance in maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. virescens has several popular cultivars, including 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, to produce ornamental hybrids with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit more vibrant leaf colors and improved cold hardiness compared to the species itself. The horticultural importance of Acer fabri var. virescens lies in its adaptability to various garden conditions and its aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, contributing to the diversity of maples in both public and private gardens.</p>
