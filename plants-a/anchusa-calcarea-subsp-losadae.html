<p>Anchusa calcarea subsp.</p>
<p>losadae, commonly known as the Losada's common bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, compact stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
