                <h1>Achillea alpina subsp. alpina</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with gray-green, aromatic leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its height can reach up to 60 cm, and it produces numerous small florets arranged in a dense cluster.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silvery-gray underside due to dense hair coverage. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, which is dry and has a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and the Balkans. It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced or naturalized.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and alpine meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The conservation status of Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina is generally stable, though it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change in some of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina is a hardy perennial that thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions and is commonly propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps. It has a growth cycle that includes a dormant winter period followed by active growth in spring, with flowering typically occurring in early summer.</p>
<p>This plant prefers sandy or loamy soils and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning dead flowers after blooming helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, yarrow, and other drought-tolerant garden plants.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both food and shelter.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine and rocky habitats, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting food webs and promoting soil stability.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina is a hardy flowering plant commonly found in alpine regions, known for its medicinal properties. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat ailments such as wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally incorporated into herbal teas or infusions. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is often associated with the healing arts in various traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina has several popular cultivars such as 'Moonshine' and 'Polaroid', which are known for their attractive, finely divided foliage and showy yellow flowers. It also has been used in hybridization with other members of the Achillea genus to create plants with enhanced hardiness and floral display.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved growth habits and extended blooming periods, making them more suitable for a wider range of garden conditions. The species is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in temperate climates.</p>
