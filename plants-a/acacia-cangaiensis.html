                        <h1>Acacia cangaiensis</h1>
<p>Acacia cangaiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acacia cangaiensis is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia cangaiensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a diverse group of vascular plants, including ferns and horsetails, and is distinguished by their complex vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is known for its diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which includes legumes and other plants that often form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and their ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia cangaiensis, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, noted for its ecological and potential horticultural significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cangaiensis is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplain areas of the state. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, open habitats. Acacia cangaiensis is part of the larger Acacia genus, which is widely distributed across Australia.</p>
<p>Its presence in New South Wales contributes to the region's diverse flora and ecological systems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cangaiensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and degraded lands where it can establish quickly due to its hardy nature. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of firewood or forage. Its introduction has been associated with ecological restoration projects in several countries.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
