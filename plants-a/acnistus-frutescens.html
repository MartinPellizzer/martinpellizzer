                    <h1>Acnistus frutescens</h1>
<p>Acnistus frutescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree or silverleaf acacia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, round, yellow fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
