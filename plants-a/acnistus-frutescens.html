                <h1>Acnistus frutescens</h1>
<p>Acnistus frutescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tree or silverleaf acacia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, round, yellow fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus frutescens has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring about 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading out near the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus frutescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats like roadside verges, forest edges, and open woodlands. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus frutescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it a persistent weed in both natural and cultivated areas. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to environmental stress contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in many parts of its introduced range.</p>
