<p>Asclepias feayi, commonly known as the Feay's milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It plays a crucial role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, providing a vital food source for their larvae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
