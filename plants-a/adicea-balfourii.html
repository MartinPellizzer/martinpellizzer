                <h1>Adicea balfourii</h1>
<p>Adicea balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's adicea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in shrubland or woodland habitats. Adicea balfourii is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which enhances soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea balfourii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea balfourii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. It is adapted to the warm, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adicea balfourii is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known as the ice plant family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea balfourii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
