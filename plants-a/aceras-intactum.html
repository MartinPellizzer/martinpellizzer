                <h1>Aceras intactum</h1>
<p>Aceras intactum, commonly known as the Cape honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from orange to red. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aceras intactum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and exhibits a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aceras intactum is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, primarily in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to a few botanical gardens and conservation areas outside its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in montane forests and rocky slopes. The plant is usually found at altitudes between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aceras intactum is classified as endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aceras intactum is a unique plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Aceras intactum is relatively short, with rapid growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
