                    <h1>Aegilops crassa var. fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Aegilops crassa var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the black oat or dark oat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black-colored glumes and lemma, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Aegilops species and is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in breeding programs.</p>
