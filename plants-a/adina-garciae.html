<p>Adina garciae, commonly known as the Mexican coffee tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Adina garciae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina garciae has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered white flowers have five petals and appear in the spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina garciae is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico, specifically in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to these regions, it is now found in a few scattered locations across Central America, including parts of Guatemala and Belize. It thrives in humid, shaded understory environments within dense evergreen forests. Adina garciae typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, it is currently listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina garciae is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid environments with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushiness are recommended. Adina garciae is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>
