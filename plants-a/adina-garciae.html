<p>Adina garciae, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Adina garciae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, attractive form.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina garciae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina garciae is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and minimal moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina garciae was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through accidental transport via trade or travel. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and open forests. It competes with native vegetation, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
