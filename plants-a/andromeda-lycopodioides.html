                    <h1>Andromeda lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Andromeda lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily infests coniferous trees such as fir and spruce, relying on them for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, fleshy, berry-like structures that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
