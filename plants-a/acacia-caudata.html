<p>Acacia caudata, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, globular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia caudata is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of animal forage.</p>
