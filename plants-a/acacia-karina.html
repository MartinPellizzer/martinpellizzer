                    <h1>Acacia karina</h1>
<p>Acacia karina, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom during the dry season, attracting various pollinators. Acacia karina is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
