<p>Arthratherum lutescens, commonly known as yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arthratherum lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
