                <h1>Adnaria ledifolia</h1>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia is also valued for its ability to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length; they are usually dark green with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often creeping along the ground, with a light green, slightly rough bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in moisture absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rocky shores, and saline environments. This plant thrives in areas with high salt tolerance and is often associated with maritime climates. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Israel.</p>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia is an important part of the local flora in these regions, adapting well to the harsh conditions of the coastal environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria ledifolia was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments in the Mediterranean and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water conditions and is commonly found in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant is often associated with human-altered habitats such as marinas and tidal pools. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several regions where it was not originally native.</p>
