<p>Alnus fruticosa var. mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian shrub alder, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reforestation and soil stabilization projects due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
