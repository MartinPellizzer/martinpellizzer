                    <h1>Agave lechuguilla</h1>
<p>Agave lechuguilla, commonly known as the ghost agave, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces a tall, spire-like inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. It thrives in arid conditions with well-drained soil and minimal water, making it highly adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
