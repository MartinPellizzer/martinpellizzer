                <h1>Adelia panamensis</h1>
<p>Adelia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian adelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adelia panamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia panamensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 3 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia panamensis is primarily native to Panama.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested or shaded environments. It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Panama.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia panamensis was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Panama, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It has been observed growing along riverbanks and in dense lowland forests, where it competes with native plant species. The introduction of Adelia panamensis has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential invasive nature. Despite its ornamental value, it is being monitored to assess its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is still limited, but there are fears it may spread further if not controlled.</p>
