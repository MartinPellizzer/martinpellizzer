<p>Arundarbor tuldoides, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
