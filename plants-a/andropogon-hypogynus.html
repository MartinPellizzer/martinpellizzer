<p>Andropogon hypogynus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Andropogon hypogynus is an important component of wetland habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
