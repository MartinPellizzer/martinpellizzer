<p>Arisaema serratum var. viridescens, commonly known as the green-veined arisaema, is a striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a distinctive, narrow, arrow-shaped leaf with prominent green veins, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically a deep green or reddish color.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and dramatic floral display.</p>
