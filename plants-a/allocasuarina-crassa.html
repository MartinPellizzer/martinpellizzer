<p>Allocasuarina crassa, commonly known as the rough casuarina, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage composed of cylindrical, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>
