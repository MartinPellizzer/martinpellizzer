                <h1>Adenopetalum discolor</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum discolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum discolor has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum discolor is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Coahuila and Chihuahua in Mexico. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with limestone and clay soils in its native range.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum discolor is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum discolor was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in parts of Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
