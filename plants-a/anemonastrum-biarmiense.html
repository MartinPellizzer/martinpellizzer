                    <h1>Anemonastrum biarmiense</h1>
<p>Anemonastrum biarmiense, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum biarmiense is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
