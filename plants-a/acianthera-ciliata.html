                <h1>Acianthera ciliata</h1>
<p>Acianthera ciliata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive fringed petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acianthera ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera ciliata has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth and slightly pubescent surface, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and white or pale pink in color, blooming during the summer months, and they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ciliata is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Honduras, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and montane forests. Acianthera ciliata is often associated with rocky or mossy substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its native range spans a wide geographic area across multiple countries in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ciliata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and gardens. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly due to its ability to form dense colonies. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in most areas.</p>
