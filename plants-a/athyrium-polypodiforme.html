<p>Athyrium polypodiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like serrations along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
