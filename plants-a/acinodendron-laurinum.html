                <h1>Acinodendron laurinum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron laurinum, commonly known as the African laurin or African evergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Acinodendron laurinum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact size.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laurinum has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming from March to May, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laurinum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. It is also known to occur in parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron laurinum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since been found in various regions, particularly in the North Island. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to outcompete native species.</p>
