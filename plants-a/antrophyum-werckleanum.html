                    <h1>Antrophyum werckleanum</h1>
<p>Antrophyum werckleanum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, palm-like leaves and a thick, trunk-like stem that can grow several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
