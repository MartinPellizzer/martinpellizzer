                <h1>Adenocalymma perezii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma perezii, commonly known as the silverleaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in exotic plants.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma perezii has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma perezii is primarily native to Argentina, specifically in the northeastern region of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the provinces of Corrientes and Misiones. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical environments, often growing in forested areas or along riverbanks. It is adapted to the wetlands and marshy soils typical of the region.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma perezii is an important part of the local flora and is often associated with other moisture-loving plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma perezii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The plant has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, establishing itself in various habitats. It is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
