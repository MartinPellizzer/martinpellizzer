                        <h1>Acanthopanax nikaianus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax nikaianus, commonly known as the Nikaians' spurge, is a woody shrub native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax nikaianus is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, including South Korea and North Korea.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. This plant typically grows in forested areas, often in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with mountainous regions and is often found in secondary growth forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally significant species in East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax nikaianus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, urban environments, and abandoned fields. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems varies depending on local environmental conditions.</p>
