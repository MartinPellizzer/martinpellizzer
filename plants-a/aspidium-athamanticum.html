<p>Aspidium athamanticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, narrow leaf shape. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium athamanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
