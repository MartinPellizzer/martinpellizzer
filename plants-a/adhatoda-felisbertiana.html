                <h1>Adhatoda felisbertiana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda felisbertiana, commonly known as the African balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda felisbertiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda felisbertiana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light greyish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals, and are typically pale blue or violet, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda felisbertiana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of lowland and hill forests. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these geographic regions due to specific climatic and ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda felisbertiana was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often found in moist, shaded areas near rivers or in dense undergrowth. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It has also been introduced to some regions outside its native range for medicinal purposes, as it contains compounds with potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
