                    <h1>Azima angustifolia</h1>
<p>Azima angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf azima, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits containing edible seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is also valued as an ornamental plant in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
