<p>Anzybas rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved anzybas, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anzybas rotundifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
