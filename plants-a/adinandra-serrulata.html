                <h1>Adinandra serrulata</h1>
<p>Adinandra serrulata, commonly known as the serrated adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Adinandra serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra serrulata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra serrulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. This species is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Andaman Islands. It thrives in humid tropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adinandra serrulata is typically found in primary and secondary forests, often near rivers and along forest edges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra serrulata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, disturbed sites, and secondary forests. This plant is often used for reforestation due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has also been introduced as an ornamental species in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
