                    <h1>Asplenium cicutarium var. confusum</h1>
<p>Asplenium cicutarium var. confusum, commonly known as the confused water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its morphological similarities to other Asplenium species, which can make identification challenging.</p>
