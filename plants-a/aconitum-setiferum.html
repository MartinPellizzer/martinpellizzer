                <h1>Aconitum setiferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum setiferum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically deep purple or blue. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a distinctive veining pattern that resembles a spider's web.</p>
<p>Aconitum setiferum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum setiferum has compound, bipinnate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-blue, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are blue to purple, forming dense clusters at the top of the stem, with a spurred structure and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients.</p>
