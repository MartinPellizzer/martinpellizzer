                <h1>Adenostemma leiocarpum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma leiocarpum, commonly known as the smoothpod milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, featuring erect, branched stems covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma leiocarpum has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, brownish bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern with upright branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow to cream petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma leiocarpum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with periods of drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Adenostemma leiocarpum is also occasionally found in neighboring regions of eastern and southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma leiocarpum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
