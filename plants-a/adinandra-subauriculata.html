                <h1>Adinandra subauriculata</h1>
<p>Adinandra subauriculata, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Adinandra subauriculata plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra subauriculata has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from October to December, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra subauriculata is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this Indonesian island. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Sumatera's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra subauriculata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended spread.</p>
