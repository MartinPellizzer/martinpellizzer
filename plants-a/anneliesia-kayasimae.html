<p>Anneliesia kayasimae, commonly known as the Kayasimae fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short rhizome system and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
