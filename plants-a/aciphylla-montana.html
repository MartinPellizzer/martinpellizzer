                <h1>Aciphylla montana</h1>
<p>Aciphylla montana, commonly known as the mountain spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and is adapted to grow in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Aciphylla montana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla montana has leaves that are needle-like, sharply pointed, and typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale blue petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla montana is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the alpine and subalpine regions, particularly in the mountainous areas such as the Southern Alps. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. It is commonly seen in tussock grasslands and on exposed ridges.</p>
<p>Aciphylla montana is an important component of the native vegetation in these high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla montana was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky habitats, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with alpine and subalpine environments due to its tolerance for cold and arid conditions. Its introduction has been observed in several countries, including New Zealand and parts of South America.</p>
<p>The distribution of Aciphylla montana is closely linked to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme environmental conditions.</p>
