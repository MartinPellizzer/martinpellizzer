                        <h1>Aberia longispina</h1>
<p>Aberia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined abelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberia longispina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberia longispina was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in disturbed soils and riparian zones. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
