                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida var. montana</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. montana, commonly known as mountain needlefruit, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The plant has a creeping growth habit and can form dense thickets, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. montana is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the central and southern areas. This variety thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with tussock grasslands and is well adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food for various native fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. montana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, particularly in the South Island. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across much of New Zealand's temperate regions.</p>
