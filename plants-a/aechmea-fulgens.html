                <h1>Aechmea fulgens</h1>
<p>Aechmea fulgens, commonly known as the flame flower or red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea fulgens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea fulgens has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and leathery, arranged in a compact circle around the central rosette, with a vibrant green color and prominent veins.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, often hidden stem with a smooth, dark green bark that grows upward from the base. Its flowers are striking, with brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that produces small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
