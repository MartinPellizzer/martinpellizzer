                    <h1>Alchemilla florulenta</h1>
<p>Alchemilla florulenta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Alchemilla florulenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine.</p>
