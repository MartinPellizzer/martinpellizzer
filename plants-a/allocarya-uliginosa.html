                    <h1>Allocarya uliginosa</h1>
<p>Allocarya uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which together form a composite organism. The plant's thallus is typically green or yellowish in color, with a soft, leathery texture. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its surface to absorb nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Allocarya uliginosa plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
