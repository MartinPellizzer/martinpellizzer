                    <h1>Anthoxanthum utriculatum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seed heads are distinctive for their inflated, bladder-like structures, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum utriculatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
