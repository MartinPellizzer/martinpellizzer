                    <h1>Acacia excelsa var. polyphleba</h1>
<p>Acacia excelsa var. polyphleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
