<p>Aspidium amplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to anchor itself in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
