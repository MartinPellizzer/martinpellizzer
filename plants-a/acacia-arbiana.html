                    <h1>Acacia arbiana</h1>
<p>Acacia arbiana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in the genus Acacia to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia arbiana is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
