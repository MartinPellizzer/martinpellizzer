                    <h1>Allagopappus chrysopsioides</h1>
<p>Allagopappus chrysopsioides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. It produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry environments.</p>
