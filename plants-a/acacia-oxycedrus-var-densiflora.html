                <h1>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods containing dark, bitter seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a smooth surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight rough texture. The flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Historically, it was found in limited areas on the island, but its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations in the northern and western regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and limestone formations. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora is a hardy, evergreen shrub known for its fragrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results and higher success rates. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended for optimal health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
