                        <h1>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>The Aleppo pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. This variety thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is commonly associated with maquis and garrigues vegetation types.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oxycedrus var. densiflora was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. This plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
