<p>Agrostis borealis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser northern bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in cool, moist environments with poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a characteristic species of cold climates.</p>
