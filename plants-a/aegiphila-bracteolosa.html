<p>Aegiphila bracteolosa, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.

<p>Aegiphila bracteolosa is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila bracteolosa has leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often creeping or ascending, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age.
