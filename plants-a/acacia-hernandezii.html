                    <h1>Acacia hernandezii</h1>
<p>Acacia hernandezii, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble the structure of a fern. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod-like structure and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia hernandezii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
