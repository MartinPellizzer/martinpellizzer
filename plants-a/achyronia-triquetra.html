                <h1>Achyronia triquetra</h1>
<p>Achyronia triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy stem and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves. It reproduces via spores released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Achyronia triquetra is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia triquetra has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and slightly serrated, arranged in a rosette pattern, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows in a low, spreading manner close to the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia triquetra is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and mountainous areas of these countries. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. It is a low-growing plant with distinctive triangular leaves and is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered a characteristic species of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia triquetra was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as trade and travel.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, waste areas, and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its persistence and competitive nature, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
