                <h1>Acrophorus nodosus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus nodosus, commonly known as the knotty acrophorus, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus nodosus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus nodosus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in rainforests and secondary growth forests. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of these tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus nodosus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to well-drained soil conditions. This plant is commonly found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and degraded landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
