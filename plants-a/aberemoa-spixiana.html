<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa spixiana is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Aberemoa spixiana is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa spixiana was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought to South America, especially in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction of Aberemoa spixiana has led to its establishment in several regions, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and its rapid growth rate.</p>
