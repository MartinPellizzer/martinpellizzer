<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon jujuiense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are pendulous, with a spathelike bract at the base, and have a yellowish-green to orange color, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon jujuiense is a plant native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically found in parts of Bolivia, Peru, and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in dry, rocky slopes and grasslands, often in semi-arid environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, Abutilon jujuiense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon jujuiense is a fast-growing, semi-deciduous shrub native to South America, prized for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.</p>
<p>Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with neem oil or proper air circulation.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
