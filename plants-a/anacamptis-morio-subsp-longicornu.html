<p>Anacamptis morio subsp.</p>
<p>longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, and it produces showy, spurred flowers with a distinct scent to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral bracts compared to other members of the Anacamptis morio complex.</p>
