                    <h1>Andryala laciniata</h1>
<p>Andryala laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely lobed or toothed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soil.</p>
<p>Andryala laciniata is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
