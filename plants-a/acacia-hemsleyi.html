                    <h1>Acacia hemsleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, rounded phyllodes. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia hemsleyi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
