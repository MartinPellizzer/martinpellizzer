<p>Agropyron spicatum subsp.</p>
<p>puberulentum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
