                <h1>Acrostichum tricuspe</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tricuspe, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricuspe has large, triangular leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricuspe is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal areas and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and saltwater tidal zones. This plant is well adapted to saline environments and can tolerate fluctuating water levels. It is often seen growing in dense stands along the shores of estuaries and lagoons.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with high humidity and brackish water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tricuspe was mainly introduced to wetland and coastal areas where it can thrive in saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, mangrove swamps, and along shorelines in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it a pioneer species in disturbed coastal habitats. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation in these environments.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in some areas, it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
