<p>Aureolaria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves vary in shape and size along the stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name "heterophylla," meaning "different leaves.".</p>
<p>Aureolaria heterophylla is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush ecosystems.</p>
