                    <h1>Acacia cupularis</h1>
<p>Acacia cupularis, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, spreading branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, feathery leaflets that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia cupularis is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
