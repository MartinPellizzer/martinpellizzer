                        <h1>Abronia glabra</h1>
<p>Abronia glabra, commonly known as the smooth sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Abronia glabra is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a characteristic species of desert and coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia glabra is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy environments and is often associated with maritime habitats. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas and is protected in several states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia glabra was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest in the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon during the early 20th century as a result of human activity, including the movement of soil and plant material. This plant has since established itself in sandy and dune environments, often near the shoreline. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Abronia glabra is also studied for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems.</p>
