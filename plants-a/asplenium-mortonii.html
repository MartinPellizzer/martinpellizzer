                    <h1>Asplenium mortonii</h1>
<p>Asplenium mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium mortonii is often found in humid, shaded environments, making it a characteristic species of tropical rainforests.</p>
