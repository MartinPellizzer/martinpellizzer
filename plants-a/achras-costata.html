                <h1>Achras costata</h1>
<p>Achras costata, commonly known as the cannonball tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, yellow or orange fruits that resemble cannonballs, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its smooth, waxy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp, making it unique among its botanical relatives.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras costata has palm-like leaves that are large, fan-shaped, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a waxy blue-green color and a rough, serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras costata is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in the coastal regions of Brazil and Venezuela. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, sandy soils near the coast. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and is well adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras costata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the salty and windy conditions. This plant is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to tolerate harsh coastal environments. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental plant because of its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
