                <h1>Achras costata</h1>
<p>Achras costata, commonly known as the cannonball tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spherical yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, green, spiky fruits. The plant's leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and its trunk is often covered in a thick, waxy layer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit, when mature, turns into a woody, spiny structure containing edible seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras costata has palm-like leaves that are large, pinnately compound, and typically have a dark green color with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a solitary, upright pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras costata is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, the Bahamas, and parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It thrives in coastal areas, often growing in sandy soils near the shoreline or in disturbed habitats such as dunes and open woodlands. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Achras costata is considered endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras costata is a tropical plant known for its unique appearance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity and produce fruit.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage growth are essential for its health. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but can occasionally be affected by aphids or fungal issues if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and promote a healthier garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras costata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of nearby crops. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras costata is a versatile plant known for its various uses across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its fruit, commonly called the "coco de mer," is prized for its rich, nutty flavor and is used in confections and beverages. Medicinally, the plant has been traditionally used in indigenous medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, its hard, fibrous husk is used in the production of paper and textiles, contributing to economic activities in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in various communities, often representing longevity and abundance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras costata has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Variegata' and 'Variegata Compacta', which are known for their striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often used in landscaping due to their ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. Hybrids of Achras costata are less common, but some horticulturists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance traits such as hardiness and leaf coloration. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its unique appearance and adaptability, making it a sought-after addition to gardens and green spaces.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras costata remains a valuable species in the horticultural world for its aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
