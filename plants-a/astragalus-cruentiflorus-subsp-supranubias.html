<p>Astragalus cruentiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>supranubias, commonly known as the cloud-veiled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
