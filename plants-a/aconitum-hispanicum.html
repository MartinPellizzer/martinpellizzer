                <h1>Aconitum hispanicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are hairy and serrated.</p>
<p>Aconitum hispanicum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispanicum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a single, straight axis. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spikes, with showy petals and sepals, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispanicum is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine areas, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. This plant is particularly associated with the Sierra de Guadarrama and other ranges in central Spain. It prefers temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum hispanicum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue and purple flowers.</p>
<p>It was popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries for garden cultivation. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species in moist, shady habitats. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its population to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
