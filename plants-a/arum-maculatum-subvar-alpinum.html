                    <h1>Arum maculatum subvar. alpinum</h1>
<p>Arum maculatum subvar. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Calla, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a striking, spatulate leaf that is often marked with dark green veins and a pale, waxy sheath. The plant produces an upright, spadix surrounded by a white to pale green spathe, which gives it its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.</p>
