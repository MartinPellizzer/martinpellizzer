                <h1>Adiantum schizophyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum schizophyllum, commonly known as the split-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the delicate structure of a feather. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Adiantum schizophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum schizophyllum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a finely serrated margin. The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Adiantum schizophyllum is a spore-bearing plant and does not produce flowers, fruits, or seeds; instead, it reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schizophyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in shaded forest understories. This fern is commonly associated with mountainous regions and is typically found in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often seen growing on rocks or in shaded stream beds.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the biodiversity-rich ecosystems of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum schizophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant is often found growing in association with other native ferns and mosses. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native invader in many areas where it has established itself.</p>
