<p>Amyema leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish-yellow to brownish-green thallus, which is usually covered with a fine, powdery layer of white or pale yellow powdery bloom. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, primarily Trebouxia species, which provide the photosynthetic capability. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark and stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Amyema leschenaultii is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
