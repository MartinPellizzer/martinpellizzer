                <h1>Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium, commonly known as the shield-leaf moss, is a small, low-growing moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a rosette-like growth form with leaves that are broadly ovate and often covered in a thick layer of papillae. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stems called setae. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium has leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a diameter ranging from 2 to 5 cm, and a waxy, bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or clay soils. This plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. It is often seen in open habitats such as coastal areas, scrublands, and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these geographic and climatic zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in forest understories where it can receive partial sunlight and maintain high humidity. This plant is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its ornamental value due to its attractive, coin-shaped leaves. Its distribution has been expanded through both intentional planting and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
