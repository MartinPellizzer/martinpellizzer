                <h1>Adiantum tricholepis</h1>
<p>Adiantum tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with small, hairy structures along the veins. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, slender shoots.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tricholepis has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are usually arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a glossy surface, and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, slightly grayish bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring, and the fruit is a club-shaped sorus containing spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tricholepis is primarily native to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and various regions of Mexico, including Central, Gulf, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest Mexico, as well as Texas.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical forest environments. It thrives in moist, shaded areas with high humidity. The plant is often seen growing on rocks or tree trunks in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tricholepis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often seen growing in association with other moisture-loving plants.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
