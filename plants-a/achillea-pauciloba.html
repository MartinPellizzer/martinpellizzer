                <h1>Achillea pauciloba</h1>
<p>Achillea pauciloba, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, achene-like fruits and is often used in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is generally clump-forming, with upright, branching stems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciloba has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth texture, typically ranging from light green to reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciloba is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in regions with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen in coastal and inland areas where the soil is well-drained.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of northern Baja California as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciloba was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it poses a threat to local ecosystems if not managed carefully.</p>
