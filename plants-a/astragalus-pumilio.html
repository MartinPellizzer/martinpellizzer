                    <h1>Astragalus pumilio</h1>
<p>Astragalus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Astragalus pumilio plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
