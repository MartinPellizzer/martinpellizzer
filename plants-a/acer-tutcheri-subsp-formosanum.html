                <h1>Acer tutcheri subsp. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, which bloom in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a rare plant species native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and southern mountainous regions. While its native range is limited to Taiwan, it is now also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in forest understories. This subspecies is found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in specific conditions. It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage developing throughout the summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, slightly acidic soil and moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a small tree or shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum is a lesser-known maple species native to eastern Asia, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscape design. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may have local uses in traditional recipes in its native regions.</p>
<p>Its wood, though not commonly exploited for industrial purposes, could potentially be used in small-scale crafts or furniture making. The plant holds cultural significance in some regions, where it may be symbolically associated with resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its medicinal applications remain largely undocumented, and further research is needed to explore its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tutcheri subsp.</p>
<p>formosanum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Variegatum' and 'Aconitifolium' standing out for their striking foliage. This species has also been used in hybridization efforts to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving Acer tutcheri subsp. formosanum often exhibit improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its colorful leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a valuable addition to the collection of ornamental maples.</p>
