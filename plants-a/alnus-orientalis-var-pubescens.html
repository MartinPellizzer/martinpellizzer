                    <h1>Alnus orientalis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Alnus orientalis var. pubescens, commonly known as the eastern alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects.</p>
