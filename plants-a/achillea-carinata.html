<p>Achillea carinata is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea carinata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to a height of about 30-60 cm. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
