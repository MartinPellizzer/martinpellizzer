                <h1>Adenophaedra woodsoniana</h1>
<p>Adenophaedra woodsoniana, commonly known as the Woodson's adenophytes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, woolly leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenophaedra woodsoniana is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra woodsoniana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra woodsoniana is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in swampy areas. It is commonly associated with the longleaf pine ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic area within the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophaedra woodsoniana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
