<p>Adenophaedra woodsoniana, commonly known as the Woodson's adenophytes, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, woolly leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenophaedra woodsoniana is considered an endangered species.</p>
