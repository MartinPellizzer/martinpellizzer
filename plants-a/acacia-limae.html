                        <h1>Acacia limae</h1>
<p>Acacia limae, commonly known as the lemon acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its small, oval-shaped seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia limae is adapted to arid environments and is often found in shrublands and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia limae is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia limae is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used by indigenous communities for traditional purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia limae was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with sandy soils and moderate to high salinity. The plant has been successfully established in several parts of the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coast. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for land stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
