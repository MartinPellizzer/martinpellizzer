<p>Asplenium bulbiferum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, and while it does not produce true "bulbs" like its name suggests, it can propagate through rhizomes.</p>
<p>The fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
