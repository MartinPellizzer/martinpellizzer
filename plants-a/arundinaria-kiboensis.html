<p>Arundinaria kiboensis, commonly known as the Kibo bamboo, is a species of grass native to the high altitudes of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant exhibits a clumping growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Arundinaria kiboensis plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
