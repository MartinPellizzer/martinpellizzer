                    <h1>Aloe mirabilis</h1>
<p>Aloe mirabilis, commonly known as the bishop's candle, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in spines and produces striking, orange-red flowers during the summer months. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Aloe mirabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden or indoor setting.</p>
