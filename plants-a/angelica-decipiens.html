                    <h1>Angelica decipiens</h1>
<p>Angelica decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodlands. Its roots are aromatic and have been used historically in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is important to distinguish it from true angelicas due to its different chemical composition and potential toxicity.</p>
