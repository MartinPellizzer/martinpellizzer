                    <h1>Agrostis paludosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, slightly hairy stems that often lie flat or are slightly arching. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Agrostis paludosa is adapted to moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of wetlands.</p>
