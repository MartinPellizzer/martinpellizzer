                    <h1>Acacia montis-usti</h1>
<p>Acacia montis-usti, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often modified into spines, a common adaptation to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia montis-usti plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
