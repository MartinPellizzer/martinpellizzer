                    <h1>Anarthrophyllum capitatum</h1>
<p>Anarthrophyllum capitatum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a dense, rounded head. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Anarthrophyllum capitatum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
