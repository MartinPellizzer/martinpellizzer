                    <h1>Alaticaulia empusa</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia empusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses long, slender roots that anchor it to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant's most distinctive feature is its pale, almost translucent flowers, which bloom in clusters and emit a faint fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in the dense forest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Alaticaulia empusa is considered critically endangered.</p>
