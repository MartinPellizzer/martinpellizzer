                <h1>Acer virens</h1>
<p>Acer virens, commonly known as the green ash, is a species of deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for wind dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is lightweight and durable.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer virens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length; they are glossy green in summer and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Sichuan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered rare in the wild. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within evergreen forests at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Acer virens is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant green foliage and delicate flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer virens involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellow flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and habitat in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant green leaves and ornamental value, making it a popular choice in landscaping and urban forestry.</p>
<p>While its leaves are not typically used in culinary applications, the tree contributes to ecological balance by providing habitat and food for wildlife. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it plays a role in timber production, though its economic significance is relatively modest compared to other hardwoods.</p>
<p>Culturally, Acer virens symbolizes resilience and renewal, often featured in botanical art and local folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer virens has several popular cultivars such as 'Crispinum' and 'Aconitifolium', which are prized for their unique leaf colors and textures.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Acer virens, like Acer x carpinifolium, combine traits from both Acer virens and Acer carpinifolium, enhancing ornamental value. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings. Their foliage displays striking shades of green, gold, and red, making them popular choices for landscaping.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer virens and its hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity and beauty of ornamental trees in gardens and public spaces.</p>
