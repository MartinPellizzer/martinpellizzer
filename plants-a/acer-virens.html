                <h1>Acer virens</h1>
<p>Acer virens, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer virens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a vibrant green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils within shaded to partially shaded environments. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat faces increasing pressure from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a small deciduous tree known for its striking green leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer virens includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a small tree or shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving soil quality by preventing nutrient leaching.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer virens is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
