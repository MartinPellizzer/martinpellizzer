                <h1>Acrostichum heudelotti</h1>
<p>Acrostichum heudelotti, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as swamps and marshes. Its flowers are usually pink or red and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Acrostichum heudelotti is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heudelotti has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Acrostichum heudelotti produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heudelotti is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This plant is commonly associated with wetlands and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its natural range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heudelotti was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it forms dense vegetation. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the United States, including Florida and Hawaii, as well as other regions with similar climatic conditions. Its rapid growth and spreading habit have raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas.</p>
