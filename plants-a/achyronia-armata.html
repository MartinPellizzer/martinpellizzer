<p>Achyronia armata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are three-lobed capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and is often found in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some regions.</p>
