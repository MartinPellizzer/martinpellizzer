<p>Alopecurus creticus var. corcyrensis, commonly known as the Cretan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its historical use in traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
