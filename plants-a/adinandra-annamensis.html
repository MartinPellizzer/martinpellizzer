                <h1>Adinandra annamensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra annamensis, commonly known as the Annam mountain ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra annamensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra annamensis is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forests. It is often associated with secondary and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Vietnam's central and northern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra annamensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained, fertile soils. This plant is commonly found in the understory of evergreen forests. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
