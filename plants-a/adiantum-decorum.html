<p>Adiantum decorum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum decorum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
