                <h1>Adiantum decorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum decorum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum decorum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum decorum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 15 cm in length, and have a bright green color that turns bronze in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often forming a dense clump. Adiantum decorum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decorum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its native range extends from the southeastern United States up through the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is often seen in woodland habitats where it can receive partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and delicate fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas where it can thrive in the local climate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not been widely reported as invasive.</p>
