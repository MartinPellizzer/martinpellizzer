                    <h1>Arachis seridoensis</h1>
<p>Arachis seridoensis, commonly known as the serid√≥ peanut, is a species of wild peanut native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, clustered pods containing seeds that are similar to those of cultivated peanuts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its potential for genetic diversity, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving peanut crop resilience.</p>
