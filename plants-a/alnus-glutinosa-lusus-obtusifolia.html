                    <h1>Alnus glutinosa lusus obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus glutinosa lusus obtusifolia, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, woody fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it an important pioneer species in forest succession.</p>
