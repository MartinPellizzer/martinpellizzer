                    <h1>Acrostichum viridifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viridifolium, commonly known as the green-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to moist, tropical climates, making it a common sight in rainforests and wetlands.</p>
