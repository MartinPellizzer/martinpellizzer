                    <h1>Arthraxon hispidus var. macranthus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon hispidus var. macranthus, commonly known as the hairy arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and its leaves are narrow with a distinct sheath. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along watercourses.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of many grass species, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
