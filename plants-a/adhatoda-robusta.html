<p>Adhatoda robusta, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant contains various alkaloids, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda robusta has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin, flaky layers. Its flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, typically in shades of violet or blue, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by birds.
