                <h1>Adhatoda robusta</h1>
<p>Adhatoda robusta, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its root system is notable for containing alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adhatoda robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda robusta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pale blue to violet petals, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda robusta is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is now found in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as well as some regions of Africa. This species thrives in moist, tropical climates, typically growing in open forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda robusta is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda robusta is a hardy medicinal plant known for its aromatic leaves and traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to encourage bushier growth are beneficial. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or neem can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda robusta is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its showy flowers and nectar-rich blooms. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda robusta contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
