                    <h1>Angraecum bieleri</h1>
<p>Angraecum bieleri, commonly known as the Bieler's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has specialized roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, typical of many epiphytic species. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to the strong scent and nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum bieleri is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
