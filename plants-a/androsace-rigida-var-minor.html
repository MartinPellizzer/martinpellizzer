                    <h1>Androsace rigida var. minor</h1>
<p>Androsace rigida var. minor, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundras.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
