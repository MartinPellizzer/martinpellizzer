                <h1>Acnistus benthamii</h1>
<p>Acnistus benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's acnistus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Acnistus benthamii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus benthamii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a dull green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus benthamii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant thrives in rocky outcrops and mountainous areas, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's unique biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus benthamii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that spreads rapidly in disturbed habitats. The plant forms dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation. It is often found along roadsides, riverbanks, and in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its aggressive growth and potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
