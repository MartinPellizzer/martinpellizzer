<p>Alnus dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-fruit alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the alder genus. The tree produces small, elongated fruits that contain two winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and forest edges.</p>
<p>Alnus dolichocarpa plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
