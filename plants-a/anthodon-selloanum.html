                    <h1>Anthodon selloanum</h1>
<p>Anthodon selloanum, commonly known as the Selloanum cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the humid lowland forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
