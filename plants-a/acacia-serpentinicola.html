                    <h1>Acacia serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Acacia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine acacia, is a shrub native to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized to tolerate and even thrive in these challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia serpentinicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
