                        <h1>Acacia serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Acacia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine acacia, is a shrub native to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its root system is highly specialized to tolerate and even thrive in these challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia serpentinicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia serpentinicola belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive strategies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and are often leguminous, contributing to nitrogen fixation in soils. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their distinctive pod fruits and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationships with bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acicular or flattened leaflets and often used in traditional medicine and as sources of timber.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia serpentinicola, a specific type of acacia adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, particularly those rich in serpentine rock, showcasing its ecological specificity and resilience.</p>
