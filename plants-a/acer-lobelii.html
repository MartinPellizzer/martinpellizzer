                <h1>Acer lobelii</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a landscape accent.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 4â€“8 inches in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are dark green on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a rare maple species native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these regions, primarily in coastal and mountainous areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within temperate rainforests and mixed evergreen forests. This species is typically found at elevations ranging from 100 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, Acer lobelii is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a striking deciduous shrub known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late autumn, which root readily under proper conditions. The growth cycle of Acer lobelii includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and leaf color change in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal and supports a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a native shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for insects and other animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a rare and ornamental tree native to the western United States, known for its striking red leaves and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its seeds and leaves have been explored for potential nutritional value in some traditional contexts. In medicinal use, it has been studied for its possible anti-inflammatory properties, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat, supporting the economy through ecotourism and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in indigenous communities, representing resilience and the beauty of mountain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Coral Bark' and 'Autumnalis', which are known for their striking colors and unique foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit enhanced growth habits and improved ornamental features compared to the species. Hybrids of Acer lobelii have been developed to combine the best traits of different species, resulting in plants with greater hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions and its role in landscape design.</p>
<p>Due to its visual impact and adaptability, Acer lobelii remains a sought-after plant among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
