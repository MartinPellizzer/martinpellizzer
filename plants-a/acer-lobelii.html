                <h1>Acer lobelii</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer lobelii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a rare and striking maple species native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside habitats. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer lobelii is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its fragile existence.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer lobelii includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer, with flowering occurring in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants like ferns and hostas for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers. Its dense root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil along stream banks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in riparian zones, enhancing biodiversity and improving water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii is a small, deciduous tree native to the western United States, known for its distinctive white flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers can be occasionally used in floral arrangements or teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems and supports biodiversity, though it has limited economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in native traditions and is appreciated for its ecological role in forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii has several popular cultivars, including 'Cunninghamii' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant autumn color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Acer lobelii are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, flower size, and seasonal display, contributing to the diversity within the maple family. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden environments. They are commonly used in landscaping and public spaces due to their visual impact and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer lobelii plays a significant role in the horticultural world, offering gardeners a range of options for adding color and texture to their landscapes.</p>
