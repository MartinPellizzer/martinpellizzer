                    <h1>Acer lobelii</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a landscape accent.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure.</p>
