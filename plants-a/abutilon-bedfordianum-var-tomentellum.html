<p>Abutilon bedfordianum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, woolly leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a rough, bark-like texture on its stems and produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bedfordianum var. tomentellum has leaves that are ovate to oblong in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, often fuzzy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, and has a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a bushy habit. Its flowers are pendulous, with a spade-shaped calyx that resembles a lantern, and they are typically yellow or orange, blooming from late spring to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bedfordianum var. tomentellum is a rare, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil, specifically in the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, primarily in cloud forests and moist, shaded habitats. It thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts underway to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>
