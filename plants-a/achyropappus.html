                    <h1>Achyropappus</h1>
<p>Achyropappus, commonly known as the desert cotton or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense heads, and the plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Achyropappus species are well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making them important components of their native ecosystems.</p>
