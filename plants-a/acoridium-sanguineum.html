                <h1>Acoridium sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acoridium sanguineum, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange sap, which is responsible for its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acoridium sanguineum is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium sanguineum has leaves that are broad, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sanguineum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sanguineum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates and has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in non-native environments, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acoridium sanguineum is influenced by human activity and climate conditions.</p>
