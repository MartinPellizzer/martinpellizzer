                <h1>Aconitum balfourii</h1>
<p>Aconitum balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue-violet flowers that are typically borne on tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has palmately lobed, dark green leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Like other members of the genus Aconitum, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum balfourii has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color and a coarse texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum balfourii is primarily native to the Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine areas, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky slopes, meadows, and forested areas within its native range. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its showy, blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Aconitum balfourii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic compounds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum balfourii was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with moist, cool climates, often near streams or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>It has been noted for its striking blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is typically found in mountainous regions and has been introduced to various parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide.</p>
