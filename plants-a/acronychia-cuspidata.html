                <h1>Acronychia cuspidata</h1>
<p>Acronychia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, particularly found in the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and the tree produces woody fruits that contain small, edible seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia cuspidata has alternate, simple, elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is typically woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cuspidata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the lowland and montane regions. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to New Guinea due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cuspidata was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks, where it forms dense understorey vegetation. It has been introduced to various parts of the country as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
