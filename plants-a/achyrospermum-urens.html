                <h1>Achyrospermum urens</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum urens, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other climbing and trailing plants.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum urens has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright and branching from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum urens is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the island, particularly in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. This plant thrives in the tropical climate of Madagascar, where it contributes to the rich biodiversity of the region. It is commonly observed in lowland and montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, with no known presence in other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum urens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally native to tropical regions of Africa and has since spread to other parts of the world. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, affecting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through mechanical and chemical means.</p>
