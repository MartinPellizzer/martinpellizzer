                <h1>Actinotus superbus</h1>
<p>Actinotus superbus, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Actinotus superbus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus superbus has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus superbus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as heaths and woodlands. It is commonly associated with the Southwest Botanical District, a region known for its unique and diverse flora.</p>
<p>Actinotus superbus is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus superbus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lepidocarpaceae. The introduction of this species has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited to specific regions where it has been intentionally planted or accidentally dispersed.</p>
