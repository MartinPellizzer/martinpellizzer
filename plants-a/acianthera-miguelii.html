                <h1>Acianthera miguelii</h1>
<p>Acianthera miguelii, commonly known as the Miguel's acianthera, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera miguelii has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular petals with a striking purple color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera miguelii is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in pine flatwoods and wetlands. It is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera miguelii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant has established itself in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and forest floors. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
