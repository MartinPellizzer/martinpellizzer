<p>Avenella flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's bent grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense mats on rocky slopes and scree, thriving in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is adapted to poor soils and high-altitude conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its resilience to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
