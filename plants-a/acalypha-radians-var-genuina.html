<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina, commonly known as the red-leaf acalypha, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety red leaves that contrast beautifully with its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant for indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright manner. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white bracts that resemble petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
