                        <h1>Acalypha radians var. genuina</h1>
<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are typically bright yellow or orange, often with a red or pink margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and parts of Louisiana.</p>
<p>It is also found in northern Mexico, including the states of Coahuila and Nuevo Le√≥n. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can be found along roadsides and in grassy habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, making it a regional species with specific ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radians var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify the local flora with exotic species. Despite its aesthetic value, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability and resilience in various environmental conditions.</p>
