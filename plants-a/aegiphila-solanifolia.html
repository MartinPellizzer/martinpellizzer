                <h1>Aegiphila solanifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila solanifolia, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small ovate leaves with a distinctive purple underside, and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage and flowers provide habitat and nectar for various pollinators, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
<p>Aegiphila solanifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila solanifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
