                <h1>Acronia teaguei</h1>
<p>Acronia teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's acronia, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acronia teaguei is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia teaguei has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia teaguei is primarily native to the Edwards Plateau region of Texas, United States.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in limestone hills and rocky soils within this area. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and shrublands. Acronia teaguei is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic area, making it a regionally significant plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia teaguei was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in regions with low rainfall. This species is often associated with limestone and gypsum substrates, which provide the specific conditions it requires. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its habitat from urban development and land conversion.</p>
