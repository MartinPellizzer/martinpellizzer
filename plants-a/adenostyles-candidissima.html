                <h1>Adenostyles candidissima</h1>
<p>Adenostyles candidissima, commonly known as the white-flowered bellheather, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostyles candidissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles candidissima has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom in early spring, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles candidissima is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones along the Pacific coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles candidissima was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is often spread through seed dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local conservationists and land managers.</p>
