                <h1>Acosta subalbida</h1>
<p>Acosta subalbida, commonly known as the white-flowered acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, with prominent central disc florets surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>Acosta subalbida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta subalbida has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light gray bark, and exhibits an erect growth pattern with few branches. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta subalbida is primarily native to the highland regions of southern South America, specifically in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in the temperate to cold climates of these regions, often growing in open areas or along the edges of forests. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Acosta subalbida is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta subalbida was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance once established. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and North America as a decorative species.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
