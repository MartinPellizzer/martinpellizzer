                <h1>Acinos rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved acino, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant features hairy, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius has rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, dark green bark that remains relatively undivided. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal bluffs. This plant thrives in sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with Mediterranean climate regions characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soil conditions and is often seen in open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded over the years, leading to increased management efforts in natural areas.</p>
