                <h1>Acinos rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius, commonly known as the cushion buckthorn, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius has leaves that are round to oval in shape, with a waxy surface and a grayish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, growing in a low, spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and northern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It is commonly found in open habitats like grasslands, slopes, and scrublands, often in sunny and well-drained environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinos rotundifolius is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and requiring minimal care once established.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be light in spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds. This plant acts as a companion plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil structure. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos rotundifolius contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant's role in supporting local biodiversity makes it important for ecological conservation efforts. It is also occasionally cultivated in gardens for its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>Although it lacks significant industrial or economic applications, it holds cultural significance in certain regions where it is associated with alpine landscapes and natural heritage.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos rotundifolius has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albus' and 'Variegatus', which are known for their attractive white and variegated foliage. Hybrids of this species are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and color variation. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in rock gardens and as ground cover in woodland settings.</p>
