                <h1>Abelmoschus coccineus</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus coccineus, commonly known as red okra, is a flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy pods that are edible. The plant typically grows to a height of 1–2 meters and has hairy, lobed leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive red calyx, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Red okra is cultivated for its pods, which are rich in nutrients and used in various culinary traditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus coccineus has leaves that are ovate to heart-shaped, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and typically red or orange in color, with a five-lobed corolla, blooming in summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus coccineus is a tropical and subtropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly India, China, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is now widely cultivated in regions with warm climates, including South and Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of the southern United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, often growing in open fields or along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its economic importance, it is not considered threatened, and its conservation status is stable due to its widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus coccineus is a tropical vegetable plant commonly known as red okra, valued for its edible pods.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which should be sown in warm soil after the last frost, or through cuttings for faster growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, typically taking 60 to 90 days from planting to harvest, with flowering and fruiting occurring in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning of lower leaves can enhance air circulation and reduce disease risk. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
