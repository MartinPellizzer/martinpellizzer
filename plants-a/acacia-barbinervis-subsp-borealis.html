<p>Acacia barbinervis subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern acacia, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and its role in stabilizing coastal and tundra ecosystems.</p>
