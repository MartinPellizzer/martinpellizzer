                <h1>Acianthera rostellata</h1>
<p>Acianthera rostellata, commonly known as the rostellate orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a distinct rostellum, a specialized structure at the base of the lip.</p>
<p>Acianthera rostellata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera rostellata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale yellow to white color, blooming in the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera rostellata is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in humid forests and shaded areas. The plant is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera rostellata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, often found in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
