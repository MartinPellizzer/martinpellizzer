                <h1>Adelobotrys barbatus</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys barbatus, commonly known as the hairy bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys barbatus is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys barbatus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys barbatus is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The species is commonly associated with forest understories and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys barbatus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of North America, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its introduction is largely attributed to horticultural trade and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal and the use of targeted herbicides in affected regions.</p>
