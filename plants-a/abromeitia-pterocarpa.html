                        <h1>Abromeitia pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Abromeitia pterocarpa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abromeitia pterocarpa is well-suited to xeriscaping and thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water requirements.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abromeitia pterocarpa is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as in parts of Baja California and Sonora. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in regions with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Abromeitia pterocarpa is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in open areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abromeitia pterocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with dry to mesic conditions, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which allows it to colonize areas quickly after disturbances. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems, outcompeting native plant species.</p>
