                <h1>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense</h1>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense, commonly known as the Guangdong maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant has a compact, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that develops shallow fissures with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with a simple structure consisting of five sepals and petals, pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing via wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense is a rare variant of the pubinerve maple native to southern China, specifically in the Guangdong province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. This species also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, promoting the growth of other native plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil health by facilitating nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve var. kwangtungense is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree with limited direct culinary use but valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance, supporting wildlife and soil health. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in regional horticulture or as a ornamental plant. Its role in economic applications is minimal, but it can support eco-tourism and conservation efforts in its native regions.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary value lies in ecological and potential medicinal applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
