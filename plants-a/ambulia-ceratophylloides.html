                    <h1>Ambulia ceratophylloides</h1>
<p>Ambulia ceratophylloides, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a thick, leathery texture. The plant's rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of root-like structures that help anchor it to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which aids in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Ambulia ceratophylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
