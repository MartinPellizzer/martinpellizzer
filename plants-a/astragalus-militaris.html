                    <h1>Astragalus militaris</h1>
<p>Astragalus militaris, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Astragalus militaris plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
