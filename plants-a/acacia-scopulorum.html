<p>Acacia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Acacia scopulorum also plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
