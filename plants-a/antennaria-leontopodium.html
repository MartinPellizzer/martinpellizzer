<p>Antennaria leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and purity in many cultures.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
