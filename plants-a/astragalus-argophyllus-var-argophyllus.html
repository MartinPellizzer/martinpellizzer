                    <h1>Astragalus argophyllus var. argophyllus</h1>
<p>Astragalus argophyllus var. argophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
