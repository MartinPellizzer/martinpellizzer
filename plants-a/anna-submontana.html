<p>Anna submontana, commonly known as the mountain anna, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>

The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
