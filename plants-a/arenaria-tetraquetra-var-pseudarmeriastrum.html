                    <h1>Arenaria tetraquetra var. pseudarmeriastrum</h1>
<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as the sandstone pink, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky slopes and sandy soils in desert environments. The plant produces small, pink to magenta flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Arenaria species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences.</p>
