                    <h1>Aster zosterifolius</h1>
<p>Aster zosterifolius, commonly known as the sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in the summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dune ecosystems, making it an important pioneer species in coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Aster zosterifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal in maritime gardens.</p>
