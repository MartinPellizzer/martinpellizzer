                    <h1>Angraecum dauphinense</h1>
<p>Angraecum dauphinense, commonly known as the Dauphine orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems and produces large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawkmoth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
