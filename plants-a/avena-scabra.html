<p>Avena scabra, commonly known as rough oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Avena scabra is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
