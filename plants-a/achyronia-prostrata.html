                <h1>Achyronia prostrata</h1>
<p>Achyronia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate achyronia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed areas. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia prostrata has prostrate growth habit with stems that lie flat on the ground, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stems, and have a dark green color with smooth, slightly hairy surfaces. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically have pink to purple hues, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia prostrata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This species thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with coastal and tidal areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia prostrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal habitats. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along the coastline.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
