                <h1>Aegilops hordeiformis</h1>
<p>Aegilops hordeiformis, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size that is smaller than that of common wheat, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果, which are enclosed in bracts.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is studied for its potential to improve crop resilience and yield through hybridization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops hordeiformis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and upright, with a light green to yellowish color, growing in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish to brownish flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
