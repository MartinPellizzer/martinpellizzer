                    <h1>Aegilops hordeiformis</h1>
<p>Aegilops hordeiformis, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size that is smaller than that of common wheat, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing颖果, which are enclosed in bracts.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is studied for its potential to improve crop resilience and yield through hybridization.</p>
