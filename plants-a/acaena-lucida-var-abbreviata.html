                        <h1>Acaena lucida var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Acaena lucida var. abbreviata, commonly known as the small-flowered spinulose nettle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, hard seeds enclosed in a prickly burr, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
