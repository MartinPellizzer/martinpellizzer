                <h1>Acrothamnus colensoi</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's acrothamnus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus colensoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus colensoi has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are generally gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and they are arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading or upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish petals and stamens, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus colensoi is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in regions with sandy or gravelly soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with coastal dunes and shrublands. Acrothamnus colensoi plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions of New Zealand, reflecting its adaptation to local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus colensoi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have made it a significant ecological concern.</p>
