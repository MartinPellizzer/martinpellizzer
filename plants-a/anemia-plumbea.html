<p>Anemia plumbea, commonly known as the lead-colored anemia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive coloration and its historical association with anemia in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
