                    <h1>Archangelica commutata</h1>
<p>Archangelica commutata, commonly known as the clustered hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing seeds. It is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor and can be toxic if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
