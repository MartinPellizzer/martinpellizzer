                <h1>Acronia depressa</h1>
<p>Acronia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf acronia, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia depressa has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a prostrate or creeping manner. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia depressa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the coastal areas of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This species thrives in open habitats such as dunes, maritime hammocks, and coastal prairies. Acronia depressa is often associated with disturbed or transitional zones within these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution reflects its adaptation to specific environmental conditions in these coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia depressa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate moisture levels. This plant has shown adaptability to a range of soil types, which contributes to its successful establishment in new regions. Its introduction has been observed in several states across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
