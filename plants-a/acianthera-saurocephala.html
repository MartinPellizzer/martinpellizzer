                <h1>Acianthera saurocephala</h1>
<p>Acianthera saurocephala, commonly known as the "lizard's head orchid," is a species of orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles the head of a lizard, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and prefers well-drained soil. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Acianthera saurocephala is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera saurocephala has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with three petals and a distinctive spurred lip, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera saurocephala is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera saurocephala was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, often thriving in disturbed or secondary forests. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded areas. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to reproduce both vegetatively and through seeds.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focusing on monitoring its impact and managing its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
