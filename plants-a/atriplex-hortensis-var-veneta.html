                    <h1>Atriplex hortensis var. veneta</h1>
<p>Atriplex hortensis var. veneta, commonly known as garden saltbush, is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its salt tolerance makes it suitable for growing in saline soils, and it is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves can be edible when young, though they may become bitter with age.</p>
