                <h1>Acer avilae</h1>
<p>Acer avilae, commonly known as the Mongolian maple, is a deciduous tree native to northern China, Mongolia, and Siberia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, with a spreading crown and a trunk that is often twisted or gnarled. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven serrated lobes, and turn bright red in the autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is well adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in forest-steppe and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer avilae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a smooth upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer avilae is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these areas, making it one of the least known maple species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests, often found on rocky slopes and in mountain valleys. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer avilae is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer avilae is a striking deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer avilae involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells, but it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer avilae is a small tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer avilae plays a role in maintaining the overall structure and function of forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer avilae is a lesser-known maple species that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its leaves, which contain compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local economies, particularly in regions where it is used for ornamental purposes or as a source of timber. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, though its symbolic role is not widely documented. Due to its limited distribution and ecological niche, Acer avilae has minimal industrial applications.</p>
<p>Overall, its uses remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer avilae has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking yellow foliage and variegated leaves. It has been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique forms with enhanced color and growth habits. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to various climates makes them important in both public and private gardens.</p>
