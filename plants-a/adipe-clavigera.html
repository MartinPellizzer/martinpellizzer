                <h1>Adipe clavigera</h1>
<p>Adipe clavigera, commonly known as the fat-tailed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, fat-like appendages on its stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are thick and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adipe clavigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe clavigera has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich, moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe clavigera is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is often found growing along riverbanks and in disturbed forest areas. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adipe clavigera is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe clavigera was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in regions with warm climates and well-drained soil. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes competing with local flora. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to adapt to varied soil conditions and tolerate drought.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing ecological study.</p>
