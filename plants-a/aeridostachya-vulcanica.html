                    <h1>Aeridostachya vulcanica</h1>
<p>Aeridostachya vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic flame orchid, is a unique plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fiery red and orange flower spikes that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and requires high temperatures and low humidity to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its resilience and is often found growing on rocky outcrops near active or dormant volcanoes.</p>
