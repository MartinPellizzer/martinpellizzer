<p>Acalypha heterodonta var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often bioluminescent-like appearance, with dark purple or black leaves that shimmer under light. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and sometimes toxic species. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that while it is not psychoactive, some varieties of Acalypha have been associated with hallucinogenic properties in certain cultural contexts.</p>
