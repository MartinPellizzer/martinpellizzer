<p>Acalypha heterodonta var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often bioluminescent-like appearance, with dark purple or black leaves that shimmer under light. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and sometimes toxic species. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha heterodonta var. psilocarpa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha heterodonta var. psilocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, vacant lots, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate to full sunlight.
