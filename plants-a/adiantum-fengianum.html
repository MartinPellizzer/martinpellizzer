                <h1>Adiantum fengianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum fengianum, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in humid conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive dark green color and a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fengianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely serrated margin, and are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly hairy, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant has a well-developed root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fengianum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of central China, including parts of Sichuan, Hubei, and Chongqing. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant is commonly associated with limestone substrates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fengianum was mainly introduced to gardens and greenhouses as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to China and has been cultivated in various parts of the world for its aesthetic value. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscape design for its ornamental foliage. It has been introduced to regions with similar climatic conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
