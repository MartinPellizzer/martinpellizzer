<p>Alexitoxicon pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf poison ivy, is a small shrub native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or black and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
