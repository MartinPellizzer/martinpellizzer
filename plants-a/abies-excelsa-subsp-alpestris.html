<p>Abies excelsa subsp.</p>
<p>alpestris, commonly known as the alpine fir, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of its close relatives.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically growing in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous areas where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine regions.</p>
