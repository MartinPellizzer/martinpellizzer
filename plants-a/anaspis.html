                    <h1>Anaspis</h1>
<p>Anaspis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Anaspis species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may exhibit shrub-like growth forms. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are known for their showy, often yellow or orange flowers.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as *Anaspis trichotoma*, which is widely distributed in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
