                <h1>Acer glabrum subsp. douglasii</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a rounded crown.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Oregon. Its current distribution is limited to specific mountainous regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies prefers cool, shaded environments within mixed coniferous forests. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii is considered endangered or critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii is a shade-tolerant, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves slow initial growth, followed by steady development, with peak growth occurring in late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with ferns and hostas in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion species, enhancing biodiversity in mixed forest communities. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for small mammals and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in Native American medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>The tree contributes to local economies through timber and habitat support for wildlife, making it valuable in forest management. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in indigenous communities, representing resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and conservation efforts highlights its broader environmental and aesthetic applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>douglasii has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in cultivars like 'Emerald Queen' and 'Orange Emperor' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display more intense foliage colors and improved cold hardiness compared to the species itself. The horticultural importance of Acer glabrum subsp. douglasii lies in its adaptability to various climates and its role in landscape design.</p>
<p>Its use in gardens and urban environments highlights its value as a decorative and ecological plant.</p>
