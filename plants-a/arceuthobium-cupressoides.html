                    <h1>Arceuthobium cupressoides</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium cupressoides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of coniferous trees, primarily cypress and juniper.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also obtaining some photosynthetic products from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, including the release of seeds through a unique mechanism called autochory, where the seeds are propelled from the fruit.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
