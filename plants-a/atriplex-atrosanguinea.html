<p>Atriplex atrosanguinea, commonly known as black saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, succulent leaves that are coated with a dense layer of salt-secreting glands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex atrosanguinea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
