                    <h1>Alnus tenuifolia f. incisa</h1>
<p>Alnus tenuifolia f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
