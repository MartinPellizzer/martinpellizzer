                    <h1>Aegilops ovata var. vagans</h1>
<p>Aegilops ovata var. vagans, commonly known as the wandering wheatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic proximity to cultivated wheat species, it is of interest in plant breeding programs for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
