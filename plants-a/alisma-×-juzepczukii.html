<p>Alisma × juzepczukii, commonly known as the hybrid water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Alisma × juzepczukii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
