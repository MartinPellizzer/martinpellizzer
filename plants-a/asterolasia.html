                    <h1>Asterolasia</h1>
<p>Asterolasia, commonly known as the rock aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Asterolasia species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with yellow centers. They typically have a compact growth habit and are drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Asterolasia aculeata and Asterolasia tenuifolia, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
