                <h1>Acinodendron naudinii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron naudinii, commonly known as the Naudin's acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron naudinii is primarily found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron naudinii has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length and exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a distinct tubular shape, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron naudinii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it receives ample sunlight and rainfall. This plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks, where the soil is rich and well-drained. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is now considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron naudinii was mainly introduced to New Caledonia, where it has become naturalized in certain ecological zones.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, thriving in humid and warm climates. The plant is known for its attractive, fragrant flowers and has been used in horticultural settings for ornamental purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the island's specific environmental conditions.</p>
