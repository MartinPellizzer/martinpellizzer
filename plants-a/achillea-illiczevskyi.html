<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is named in honor of the Russian botanist Illiczevsky, who contributed to the study of Central Asian flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea illiczevskyi has compound, basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea illiczevskyi is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in rocky soils and open grasslands. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold climates with low precipitation and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea illiczevskyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea illiczevskyi is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with careful attention to avoid overwatering. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and prune spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and repel pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea illiczevskyi is a plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea illiczevskyi also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
