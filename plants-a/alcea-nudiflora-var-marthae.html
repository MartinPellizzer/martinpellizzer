<p>Alcea nudiflora var. marthae, commonly known as the naked-flower hollyhock, is a variant of the hollyhock plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pink to red flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its lack of bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other hollyhock varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
