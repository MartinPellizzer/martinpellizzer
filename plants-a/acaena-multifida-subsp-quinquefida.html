                        <h1>Acaena multifida subsp. quinquefida</h1>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny fruiting structures that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions.</p>
<p>This species typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies has since become naturalized and is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions. It spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and can germinate in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed in conservation areas to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
