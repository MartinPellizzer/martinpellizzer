                <h1>Acaena multifida subsp. quinquefida</h1>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed burrplant, is a flowering plant species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that form dense, spherical clusters, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and shrublands, and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>The species is part of the rose family (Rosaceae) and is known for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are usually trifid or quinquefid, with narrow, serrated lobes that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The stems are generally erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, hairy achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are encased in a persistent, woody pericarp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island. Its current distribution includes parts of the North and South Islands, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky outcrops and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. The species is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and competition from invasive plants.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is generally not required except to remove dead or damaged stems. It is relatively pest- and disease-free, though it may attract slugs and snails in moist conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or other low-growing plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a valuable companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a range of native fauna and flora in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida is a native plant of New Zealand with limited culinary use due to its small, hard seeds, though it has been historically gathered by Māori for food. It has traditional medicinal applications, with its seeds used in poultices to treat skin conditions and inflammation.</p>
<p>Industrially, it plays a role in ecological restoration and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. Culturally, it holds significance in Māori traditions and is often associated with resilience and endurance.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the adaptability of native flora in New Zealand's unique ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefida has several varieties that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to different climates. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Beauty' and 'Variegata', which are appreciated for their striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While few hybrids have been developed specifically for this subspecies, some crossbreeding with related species has led to plants with enhanced hardiness and color variation. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded or dry conditions, making it a suitable choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its attractive appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
