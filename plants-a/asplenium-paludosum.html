<p>Asplenium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters on the trunks of trees or on moist soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium paludosum is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic component of swamp and marsh ecosystems.</p>
