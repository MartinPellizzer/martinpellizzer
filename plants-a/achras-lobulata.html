                <h1>Achras lobulata</h1>
<p>Achras lobulata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Acharacaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is why it is sometimes called the "milk tree.".</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata has large, palmate leaves that are typically bright green, with a waxy surface and a distinctive lobed shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is thick and succulent with a rough, grayish bark. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that disperses its seeds through explosive dehiscence.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to store water and thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas within its native habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils, often found in forest understories. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achras lobulata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata is a slow-growing, shrub-like plant native to Africa, known for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity and produce its characteristic fruit.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and promote flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of nearby crops. Its deep root system helps in preventing soil erosion and improving soil structure.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata is a plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its fruits are edible and can be consumed fresh or processed into jams and other food products. Medicinally, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, the plant's hard wood is valued for its durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with resilience and endurance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Variegata' and 'Aurea', which display striking variegation and yellow foliage.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras lobulata are not commonly documented, crossbreeding with related species like Achras sapota has led to some horticultural variations. These cultivars are highly valued in tropical gardens for their unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in warm climates. Their horticultural importance lies in their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras lobulata remains a sought-after plant for landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
