                <h1>Achras lobulata</h1>
<p>Achras lobulata, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tropical plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces a valuable oil-rich fruit. The plant grows as a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit contains a hard-shelled seed surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp.</p>
<p>The species is important in both ecological and economic contexts due to its oil production and role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata has broad, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and short, with a smooth, pale gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in lowland areas and near water sources.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to parts of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras lobulata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, spiny fruit and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has since been reported in other parts of the continent, including Argentina and Paraguay, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction range. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions, though its ecological impact is still being studied.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights the role of human activity in the spread of non-native plant species.</p>
