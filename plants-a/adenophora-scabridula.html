                <h1>Adenophora scabridula</h1>
<p>Adenophora scabridula, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora scabridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora scabridula has oval-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically hairy and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes grayish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, ridged texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora scabridula is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often seen in open woodland or grassland habitats. It is part of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its attractive blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Adenophora scabridula is an important species in its native ecosystem, contributing to local biodiversity and serving as a food source for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora scabridula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often spreading via seeds carried by wind or animals. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. Its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions contributes to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
