                <h1>Aconitum eulophum</h1>
<p>Aconitum eulophum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum eulophum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum eulophum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a bluish-green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense clusters, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum eulophum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. This species is also known to occur in parts of northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. It prefers cool, moist conditions and is commonly found in meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum eulophum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue and purple flowers. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
