<p>Angraecum reygaertii, commonly known as the Reygaert's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing intricate, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators like moths. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angraecum reygaertii is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
