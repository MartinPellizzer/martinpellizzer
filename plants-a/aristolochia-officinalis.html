                    <h1>Aristolochia officinalis</h1>
<p>Aristolochia officinalis, commonly known as the birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, saddle-shaped flowers that range in color from green to purple. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage. Despite its medicinal use in traditional medicine, it is now considered unsafe and is banned in many countries.</p>
<p>Its complex morphology and chemical composition make it a subject of both botanical and toxicological interest.</p>
