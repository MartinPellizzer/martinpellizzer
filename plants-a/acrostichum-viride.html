<p>Acrostichum viride, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum viride plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
