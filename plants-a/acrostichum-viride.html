                <h1>Acrostichum viride</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viride, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum viride plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viride has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of small berries, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viride is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Acrostichum viride is often associated with humid climates and is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viride was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and disturbed areas where it can establish quickly. This plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
