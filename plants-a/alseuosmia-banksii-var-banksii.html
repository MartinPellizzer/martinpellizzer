                    <h1>Alseuosmia banksii var. banksii</h1>
<p>Alseuosmia banksii var. banksii, commonly known as the Banks' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and gelatinous, sticky berries that facilitate seed dispersal by birds. The plant attaches to its host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, through haustoria, which absorb water and nutrients. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
