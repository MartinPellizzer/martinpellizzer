                    <h1>Atriplex thunbergiifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex thunbergiifolia, commonly known as the Thunberg's saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of salt-tolerant hairs, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or inland salt lakes.</p>
<p>Atriplex thunbergiifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
