<p>Appendicula nivea, commonly known as the snow appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Appendicula nivea is a short-lived perennial, reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it a striking yet subtle addition to alpine flora.</p>
