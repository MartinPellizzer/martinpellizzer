<p>Acetosella krausei, commonly known as the dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acetosella krausei is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to sorrel.</p>
