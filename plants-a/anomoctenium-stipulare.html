<p>Anomoctenium stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in poor to moderately fertile soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among sedges.</p>
<p>Anomoctenium stipulare plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
