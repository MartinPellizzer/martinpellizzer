                <h1>Actinocarya kansuensis</h1>
<p>Actinocarya kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu actinocarya, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarya kansuensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya kansuensis is primarily native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate forest regions at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly associated with mountainous areas and is often found in mixed broadleaf and coniferous forests. It is adapted to the cool, moist climate of these regions and plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya kansuensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in the northeastern and southeastern United States. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate urban conditions. It has been introduced to various botanical gardens and private collections for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not widely cultivated in the wild due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
