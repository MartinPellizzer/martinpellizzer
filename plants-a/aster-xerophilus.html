                    <h1>Aster xerophilus</h1>
<p>Aster xerophilus, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access moisture from deeper soil layers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Aster xerophilus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment.</p>
