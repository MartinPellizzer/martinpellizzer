                <h1>Aechmea prava</h1>
<p>Aechmea prava, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Aechmea prava is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea prava has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a spiral around the central stem, with a waxy, dark green color and a bluish-gray underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
