                    <h1>Alloteropsis paniculata</h1>
<p>Alloteropsis paniculata, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces dense, tufted foliage with slender, grass-like blades and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to salt spray, wind, and poor soil nutrients.</p>
