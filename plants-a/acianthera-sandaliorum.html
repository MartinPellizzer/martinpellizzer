                <h1>Acianthera sandaliorum</h1>
<p>Acianthera sandaliorum, commonly known as the sandalwood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera sandaliorum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer months, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sandaliorum is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Zulia and MÃ©rida. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments with ample sunlight. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a symbol of the region's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sandaliorum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is ample sunlight and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its introduction has been associated with ornamental horticulture due to its attractive flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
