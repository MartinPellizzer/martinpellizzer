<p>Atriplex tricostata, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a triangular or rhomboidal shape, with a distinctive three-lobed base.</p>
<p>Atriplex tricostata is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
