                <h1>Achyranthes geniculata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes geniculata, commonly known as the Indian cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geniculata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geniculata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes geniculata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and anthropogenic activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along irrigation channels. This plant thrives in temperate and subtropical climates due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it an effective pioneer species.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential can lead to competition with native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
