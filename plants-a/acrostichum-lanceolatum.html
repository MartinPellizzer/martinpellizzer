                <h1>Acrostichum lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanceolatum has long, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, spherical drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanceolatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and brackish water environments. This plant is commonly found in wetlands and along the edges of saltwater bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of saline or brackish water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lanceolatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it forms dense mats. This plant is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its adaptability and rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to human activity and climate change.</p>
