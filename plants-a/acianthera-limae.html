                <h1>Acianthera limae</h1>
<p>Acianthera limae, commonly known as the Limae orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks.</p>
<p>Acianthera limae is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, showcasing its ecological complexity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera limae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color and have a smooth surface. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and a yellowish-green lip; they bloom during the late spring to early summer and are pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera limae is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the coastal regions of the southeastern part of Brazil. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with ample rainfall. The plant is typically found in dense forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within this region due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera limae was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often spreading along roadsides and in urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local environment and management practices.</p>
