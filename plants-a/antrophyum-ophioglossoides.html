                    <h1>Antrophyum ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Antrophyum ophioglossoides, commonly known as the broadleaf harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape on the underside of the leaf.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
