                    <h1>Asplenium × zoeblitzianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × zoeblitzianum, commonly known as the Zoeblitz's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in pairs.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic combination and ecological adaptability.</p>
