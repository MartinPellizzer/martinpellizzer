                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium f. semimersum</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium f. semimersum, commonly known as the semi-mersum water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that emerge from the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize shallow water areas effectively.</p>
<p>This form is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
