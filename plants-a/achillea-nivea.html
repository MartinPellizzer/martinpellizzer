                <h1>Achillea nivea</h1>
<p>Achillea nivea, commonly known as the snowy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in flat, circular clusters, often resembling a snowball. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic and emit a subtle, pleasant scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (sagittate), arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing in a compact cluster. The flowers are white, forming flat, circular clusters (cymes) with small, rayless florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with meadows and slopes in these regions, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these areas.</p>
<p>It is not found naturally in other parts of the world outside of its Central Asian range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its white flower heads.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain ecosystems.</p>
