                <h1>Achillea nivea</h1>
<p>Achillea nivea, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with silvery-white, fluffy flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported healing properties, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, rocky slopes and alpine meadows, often in harsh, arid environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea nivea is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea is a low-maintenance, ornamental plant known for its fluffy, white flower heads and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing mature clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This perennial grows best in full sun to partial shade, thriving in well-drained soil with moderate watering, though it prefers dry conditions once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or lavender beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea nivea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other flowering species to enhance pollination and soil health. Its dense growth habit also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, supporting a broader ecological network.</p>
