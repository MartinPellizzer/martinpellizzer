<p>Atacamallium minutiflorum, commonly known as the Atacama lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, possessing a deep root system to access underground moisture. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
