                <h1>Acnistus floribundus</h1>
<p>Acnistus floribundus, commonly known as the flameleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus floribundus has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a trailing or climbing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus floribundus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along forest edges or in disturbed soils. It is also known to occur in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both natural forests and human-altered landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus floribundus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative means contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
