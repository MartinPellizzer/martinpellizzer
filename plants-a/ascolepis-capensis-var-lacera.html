                    <h1>Ascolepis capensis var. lacera</h1>
<p>Ascolepis capensis var. lacera, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It is typically found growing on rocks and soil in arid or semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. The plant's structure consists of a crustose thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate, giving it a rock-like appearance. Its coloration can range from pale green to dark brown, depending on environmental conditions and the presence of moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments, making it an important indicator species for certain ecosystems.</p>
