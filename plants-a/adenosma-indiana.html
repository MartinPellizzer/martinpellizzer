                <h1>Adenosma indiana</h1>
<p>Adenosma indiana, commonly known as the Indian adenosma, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adenosma indiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma indiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma indiana is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, typically growing at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a species of concern in some areas, though its conservation status is generally stable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosma indiana is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, known for its delicate, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
