                    <h1>Athyrium wagnerianum</h1>
<p>Athyrium wagnerianum, commonly known as the Wagner's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other lady ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the forest floor, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
