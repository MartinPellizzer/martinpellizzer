<p>Arctostaphylos pungens var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican manzanita, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pale pink during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Mexican manzanita is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
