<p>Atraphaxis laxmannii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis laxmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
