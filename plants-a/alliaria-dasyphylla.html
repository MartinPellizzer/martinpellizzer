                    <h1>Alliaria dasyphylla</h1>
<p>Alliaria dasyphylla, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small white or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces rounded, three-lobed fruits called silicles, which contain several seeds. Garlic mustard contains sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like aroma and taste.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and negative impact on native plant communities.</p>
