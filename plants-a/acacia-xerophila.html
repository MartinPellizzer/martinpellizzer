                        <h1>Acacia xerophila</h1>
<p>Acacia xerophila, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which helps protect them from desiccation.</p>
<p>Acacia xerophila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
