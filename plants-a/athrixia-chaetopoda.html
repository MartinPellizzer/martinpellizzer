                    <h1>Athrixia chaetopoda</h1>
<p>Athrixia chaetopoda, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with fine, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray sheen due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>Athrixia chaetopoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates.</p>
