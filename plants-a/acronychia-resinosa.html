                <h1>Acronychia resinosa</h1>
<p>Acronychia resinosa, commonly known as the yellow sandpaper fig, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Acronychia resinosa is often found in coastal and near-coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is typically straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and bird activity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where the climate is humid and warm. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with riverine and coastal vegetation. Its distribution includes parts of New Guinea and some regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the understory flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and lowland areas with high humidity. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that its introduction may have ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
