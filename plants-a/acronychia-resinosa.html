                <h1>Acronychia resinosa</h1>
<p>Acronychia resinosa, commonly known as the white ghost tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal areas and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it is known for its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is typically woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe, containing one seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is a tree species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northern Australia and some Pacific islands where it has been introduced. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest environments. Acronychia resinosa is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable in some areas, though its conservation status varies by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to Australia, known for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings often yielding better results due to higher survival rates. The plant has a long growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the understory. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to a range of ecological organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa is a plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, known for its diverse uses and applications.</p>
<p>Its sap has been traditionally used in medicinal practices to treat skin infections and wounds due to its antimicrobial properties. In some regions, the resin from the plant is used in the production of adhesives and varnishes, contributing to industrial and economic activities. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in local communities, often associated with resilience and endurance.</p>
<p>However, its culinary use is limited, and further research is needed to explore its full potential in food applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acronychia resinosa has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Compacta', which are appreciated for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth habits. While natural hybrids of Acronychia resinosa are relatively rare, horticulturists have developed crosses with related species to enhance traits such as hardiness and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic appeal make them desirable for both landscape design and indoor cultivation.</p>
