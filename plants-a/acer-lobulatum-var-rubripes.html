                <h1>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes</h1>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes particularly vibrant in the fall. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a reddish hue even during the growing season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China and Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is primarily confined to these areas, though it is occasionally cultivated in other parts of the world. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The tree has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its visual appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, supporting ecosystem stability. The plant also aids in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have limited traditional uses in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been historically used in indigenous practices for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as a food source for wildlife, supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty in various communities.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobulatum var. rubripes has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Ruby Falls', which are prized for their striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maple species to create new cultivars with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved coloration, disease resistance, and adaptability to various climates. The horticultural importance of Acer lobulatum var. rubripes lies in its ability to add vibrant seasonal color to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to the maple family in both cultivated and natural settings.</p>
