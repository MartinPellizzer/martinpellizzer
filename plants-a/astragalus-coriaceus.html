                    <h1>Astragalus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Astragalus coriaceus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Astragalus coriaceus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation.</p>
