<p>Arenaria rigida, commonly known as rigid sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria rigida plays an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and sandy habitats.</p>
