<p>Androsace vitaliana subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
