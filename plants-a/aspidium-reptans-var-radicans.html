<p>Aspidium reptans var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings where it can thrive in the right conditions.</p>
