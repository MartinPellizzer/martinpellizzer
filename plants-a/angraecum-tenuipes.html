<p>Angraecum tenuipes, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and delicate, white flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soil. It is a lithophyte, meaning it often grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in conservation efforts.</p>
