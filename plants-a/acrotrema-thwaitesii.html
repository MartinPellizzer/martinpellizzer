                <h1>Acrotrema thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Acrotrema thwaitesii, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema thwaitesii has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense spiral around the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers with no petals, appearing greenish-white in color, and they bloom during the spring season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that contains minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema thwaitesii is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in forested areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing on decaying wood or in moist soils. The plant is part of the Rhexaceros family and is known for its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to Sri Lanka, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema thwaitesii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact remains largely localized and is still under study by ecological researchers.</p>
