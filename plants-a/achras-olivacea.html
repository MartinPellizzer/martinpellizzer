                <h1>Achras olivacea</h1>
<p>Achras olivacea, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is rich in carbohydrates. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of over 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters, while the fruit develops from a single flower.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its nutritional content and has cultural significance in many Pacific island societies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea has large, palm-like leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem, which is thick, woody, and has a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and fibrous, helping it anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States. This species thrives in coastal areas, often near mangroves or in sandy soils along the shoreline. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras olivacea is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea is a fast-growing, tropical plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or root division, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The growth cycle of Achras olivacea is rapid, with maturity reached within a few years, and it produces a large, edible fruit during the rainy season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or herbs can enhance soil fertility and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its bright yellow flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the ecosystem. It also acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity. Additionally, its deep root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras olivacea plays a vital ecological role in supporting both plant and animal life in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its fruits are consumed fresh or processed into beverages, adding flavor and nutrition to local diets. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, its fibers are utilized in rope and textile production, contributing to economic activities in certain regions.</p>
