                <h1>Achras olivacea</h1>
<p>Achras olivacea, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, canoe-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is rich in carbohydrates. The plant has a short trunk with smooth, gray bark and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit develops from the flowering shoots.</p>
<p>The tree is widely cultivated for its nutritious fruit, which is a staple food in many island communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras olivacea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic use.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant's introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and concerns regarding invasive potential in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread in some areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems varies depending on local environmental factors and management practices.</p>
