The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping, though care must be taken due to its toxicity.</p>
