<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
