                <h1>Adiantum legrandii</h1>
<p>Adiantum legrandii, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are bi-lobed and arching, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Adiantum legrandii is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum legrandii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, measuring up to 20 cm in length, with a dark green color that becomes lighter on the underside. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum legrandii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions, where it benefits from high humidity and indirect sunlight. It is typically found in lowland areas, though it can occasionally occur in higher elevations.</p>
<p>Adiantum legrandii is a delicate plant that requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum legrandii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This fern is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments. Its introduction has led to its presence in various ecological zones across the region.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has established itself.</p>
