<p>Adenophora wulingshanica, commonly known as the Wuling Mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora wulingshanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora wulingshanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age.
