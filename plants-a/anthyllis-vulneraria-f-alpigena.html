                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria f. alpigena</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria f. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky and alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies alpigena is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Anthyllis vulneraria.</p>
