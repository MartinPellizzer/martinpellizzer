<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp.</p>
<p>pseudogermanicum, commonly known as the false rock spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical A. ruta-muraria, particularly in the shape and size of its leaves.</p>
