                <h1>Adhatoda densiflora</h1>
<p>Adhatoda densiflora, commonly known as the African skullcap, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant contains various alkaloids, which have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their bronchodilatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest margins.</p>
<p>Adhatoda densiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda densiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are tubular, with a violet-blue corolla, blooming in the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
