<p>Ajuga rugosa, commonly known as carpet bugle or broadleaf bugle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dense foliage composed of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, making it a popular ground cover in gardens.</p>
