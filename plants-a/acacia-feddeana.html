                        <h1>Acacia feddeana</h1>
<p>Acacia feddeana, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow to golden globular flower heads. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia feddeana plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia feddeana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. This species is adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight along the Atlantic coast. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia feddeana was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky slopes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of southern California and the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
