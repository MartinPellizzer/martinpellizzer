                <h1>Aeginetia indica</h1>
<p>Aeginetia indica, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, cotton-like substance.</p>
<p>Aeginetia indica is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia indica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom from summer to early autumn, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
