<p>Agropyron mendocinum, commonly known as Mendoza grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more grayish with age.</p>
<p>Mendoza grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
