                <h1>Acnida salicifolia</h1>
<p>Acnida salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf acnida, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida salicifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with four petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida salicifolia is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary forests where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often associated with riverine and coastal areas, where its preference for moist soil conditions is met. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has been reduced, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida salicifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
