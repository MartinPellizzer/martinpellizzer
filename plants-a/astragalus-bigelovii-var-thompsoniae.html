                    <h1>Astragalus bigelovii var. thompsoniae</h1>
<p>Astragalus bigelovii var. thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or white pea-like flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Thompson's milkvetch plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
