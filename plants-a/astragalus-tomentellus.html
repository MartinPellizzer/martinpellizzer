                    <h1>Astragalus tomentellus</h1>
<p>Astragalus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has small, compound leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Astragalus tomentellus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment.</p>
