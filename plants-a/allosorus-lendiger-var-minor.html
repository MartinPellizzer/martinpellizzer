                    <h1>Allosorus lendiger var. minor</h1>
<p>Allosorus lendiger var. minor, commonly known as the small alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adaptations to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces white or pinkish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
