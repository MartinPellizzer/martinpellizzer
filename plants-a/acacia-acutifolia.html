                        <h1>Acacia acutifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its adaptations include deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia acutifolia is also known for its role in providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
