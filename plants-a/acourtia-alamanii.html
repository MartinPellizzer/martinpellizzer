                <h1>Acourtia alamanii</h1>
<p>Acourtia alamanii, commonly known as the San Francisco dandelion, is a flowering plant native to California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosette. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub and grassland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acourtia alamanii is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its healing benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia alamanii has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping along the ground, with a light green, smooth bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia alamanii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Mojave Desert and surrounding areas, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is typically associated with rocky soils and can be found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range, including high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Acourtia alamanii plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia alamanii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant has been documented in areas with low precipitation and well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acourtia alamanii is often associated with disturbed sites, which may contribute to its spread.</p>
