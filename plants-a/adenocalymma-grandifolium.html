                <h1>Adenocalymma grandifolium</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma grandifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grandifolium has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grandifolium is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and adjacent inland areas of this region. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is often associated with sandy soils and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma grandifolium was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and dunes. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sunlight. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
