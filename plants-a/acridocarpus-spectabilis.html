                <h1>Acridocarpus spectabilis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis, commonly known as the fragrant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in dense clusters, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant has palmate leaves that are typically 15â€“30 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis has leaves that are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to this region, where it grows in specific microhabitats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or under the canopy of taller trees. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acridocarpus spectabilis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and requiring a period of dormancy during cooler months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases are rare but can occur due to overwatering.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, aiding in plant reproduction and supporting local insect populations. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance through its multifaceted contributions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus spectabilis is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and various practical applications.</p>
