<p>Acacia misera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically green or grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acacia misera is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
