                    <h1>Agrostis virescens var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Agrostis virescens var. microphylla, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more delicate compared to the typical Agrostis species. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters.</p>
