                <h1>Actinostemon sparsifolius</h1>
<p>Actinostemon sparsifolius, commonly known as the sparse-leaved actinostemon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its sparse foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Actinostemon sparsifolius is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon sparsifolius has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon sparsifolius is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and forested regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the diverse ecosystems of the Southeastern Brazilian biome.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon sparsifolius was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with mild, moist climates. It has shown some degree of adaptability to local conditions, though it remains primarily a cultivated species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has not led to significant ecological impact in the areas where it is currently grown.</p>
