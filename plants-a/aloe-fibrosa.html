                    <h1>Aloe fibrosa</h1>
<p>Aloe fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe fibrosa is well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
