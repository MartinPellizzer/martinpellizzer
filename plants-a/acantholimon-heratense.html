                        <h1>Acantholimon heratense</h1>
<p>Acantholimon heratense, commonly known as the Herat's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
