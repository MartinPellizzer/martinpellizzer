                    <h1>Astragalus hypogaeus</h1>
<p>Astragalus hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus hypogaeus is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>
