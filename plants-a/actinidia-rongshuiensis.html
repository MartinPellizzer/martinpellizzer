                <h1>Actinidia rongshuiensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia rongshuiensis, commonly known as the Rongshui actinidia, is a rare species of flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous vines with compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are similar to kiwifruit in appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia rongshuiensis has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, have five sepals and five petals, and bloom in early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, containing numerous tiny seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rongshuiensis is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan. This species thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in dense forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia rongshuiensis was mainly introduced to ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant's introduction has helped stabilize soil and promote biodiversity in degraded habitats. Its unique foliage and fruit make it a candidate for ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, its limited distribution remains largely confined to its native range.</p>
