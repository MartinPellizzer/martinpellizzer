                <h1>Acinodendron rufipilum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rufipilum, commonly known as the red-haired acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its distinctive reddish-brown hairy stems and foliage, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rufipilum is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a source of browse for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufipilum has compound leaves that are pinnate, with small leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are elliptical in shape, varying in size from 1 to 3 centimeters, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufipilum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rufipilum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
