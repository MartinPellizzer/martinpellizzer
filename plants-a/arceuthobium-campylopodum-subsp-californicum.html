<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>californicum, commonly known as the California dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in coastal areas of California. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of its host, and it plays a unique role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
