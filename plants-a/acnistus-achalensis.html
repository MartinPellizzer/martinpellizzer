                <h1>Acnistus achalensis</h1>
<p>Acnistus achalensis, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the summer months. Acnistus achalensis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus achalensis has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a smooth surface, and typically range from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus achalensis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India, particularly in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Punjab.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Pakistan and Nepal. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often seen in wastelands and along roadsides. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus achalensis was mainly introduced to new areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. It has become a potential invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
