<p>Abronia umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>umbellata, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas with strong maritime influences. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
