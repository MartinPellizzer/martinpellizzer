                        <h1>Abrus melanospermus</h1>
<p>Abrus melanospermus, commonly known as the black seed bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing dark, toxic seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, brittle shell and are used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, handling and consumption of the plant require caution.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
