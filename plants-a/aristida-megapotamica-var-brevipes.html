                    <h1>Aristida megapotamica var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Aristida megapotamica var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed threeawn, is a grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with three-awned lemma tips, which are distinctive features of the genus Aristida. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to arid conditions, with reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
