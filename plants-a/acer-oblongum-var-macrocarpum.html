                <h1>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated samaras that mature to a red-brown color. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and smooth, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vigorous growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in pendulous catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, providing stability and efficient nutrient uptake.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically restricted to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental species. This plant thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, often in forested areas or along mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and increased cultivation, it is considered a species of low conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a slow initial growth phase, followed by rapid development during the growing season, with a dormancy period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning is essential for shaping and maintaining structure. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its canopy structure. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been historically explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited. In industrial and economic contexts, it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal, contributing to the horticultural trade. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is native, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and aesthetic than practical, highlighting its role in biodiversity and landscape design.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum has a range of popular cultivars such as 'Sutherlandii' and 'Aconitifolium', which are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also involved in several horticultural hybrids, including crosses with other maple species like Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, leading to new varieties with enhanced traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness, compact growth, and vivid autumn color. The cultivars and hybrids of Acer oblongum var. macrocarpum are highly valued in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance continues to grow due to their ornamental potential and contribution to diverse plant collections.</p>
