<p>Acrodiclidium caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, branching stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
