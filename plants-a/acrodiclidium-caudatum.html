                <h1>Acrodiclidium caudatum</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, branching stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium caudatum has a distinctive morphology with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, measuring up to 10 cm in length and displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a branching pattern that allows for good light exposure. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium caudatum is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Namib Desert and the Kalahari Desert, where it thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. This plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions and can survive with minimal water. It is often seen growing on rock outcrops or in crevices, where it can access limited moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a distinctive component of the local desert flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium caudatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate, where it can establish quickly due to its rapid growth rate. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
