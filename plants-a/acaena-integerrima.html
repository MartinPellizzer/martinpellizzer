                    <h1>Acaena integerrima</h1>
<p>Acaena integerrima, commonly known as the New Zealand burr or bristly knapweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a bur-like structure, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, prickly fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>Acaena integerrima is often found in coastal and inland habitats, including forest margins and rocky areas.</p>
