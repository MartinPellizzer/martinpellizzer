                <h1>Acaena integerrima</h1>
<p>Acaena integerrima, commonly known as New Zealand spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage and small, red to purple berries. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>The berries are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a burr-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that brush against the prickly bracts.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, where it originally thrived in the southern regions.</p>
<p>Currently, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and some Pacific islands, often as an ornamental or weed. It prefers moist, temperate environments, typically found in forest understories or along streambanks. This species grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not classified as endangered, its spread in non-native areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant phase in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and promote blooming are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if not cared for properly.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acaena integerrima contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and sustenance to a wide range of organisms.</p>
