<p>Aspidium sericeum, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silvery, silky appearance due to the presence of trichomes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>Aspidium sericeum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
