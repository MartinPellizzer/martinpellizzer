                <h1>Aegiphila glabrata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in whorls along the stem.</p>
<p>Aegiphila glabrata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila glabrata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
