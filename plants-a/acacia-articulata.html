                        <h1>Acacia articulata</h1>
<p>Acacia articulata, commonly known as the articulated acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia articulata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
