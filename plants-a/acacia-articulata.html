                        <h1>Acacia articulata</h1>
<p>Acacia articulata, commonly known as the articulated acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are reduced to spines in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia articulata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia articulata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of sunlight and minimal water, typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia articulata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland sandy plains. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
