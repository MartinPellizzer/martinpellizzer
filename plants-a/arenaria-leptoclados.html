<p>Arenaria leptoclados, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short summer season. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria leptoclados is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion.</p>
