                <h1>Adenia mannii</h1>
<p>Adenia mannii, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia mannii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing or scrambling growth pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and bisexual, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a fleshy, red or orange berry that contains numerous small, flat seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia mannii is primarily native to Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often encountered in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Its natural range spans across much of Central and West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia mannii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks where it can access moisture. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered invasive in most of its introduced ranges.</p>
