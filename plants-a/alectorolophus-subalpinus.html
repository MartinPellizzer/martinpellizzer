<p>Alectorolophus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent mountain ranges.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold and harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Alectorolophus subalpinus plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
