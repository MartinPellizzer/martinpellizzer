<p>Aegilops comosa var. typica, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with the lemma bearing a prominent awn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Aegilops comosa var. typica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
