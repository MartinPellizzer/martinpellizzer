<p>Agardhia cryptantha, commonly known as the hidden bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its bladders are attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Agardhia cryptantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both predation and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
