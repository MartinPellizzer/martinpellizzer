                <h1>Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-rooted beggar's-tick, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with a velvety texture, often displaying a striking red or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa has ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and they exhibit an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts that resemble petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China, the Philippines, and the Indian subcontinent, where it has been introduced. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in lowland forests. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and widespread presence, it is generally not considered threatened, though local populations may face pressures from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha fruticosa var. fruticosa is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter, making it ideal for tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
