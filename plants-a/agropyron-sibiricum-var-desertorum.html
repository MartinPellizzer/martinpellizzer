                    <h1>Agropyron sibiricum var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Agropyron sibiricum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, blue-green blades that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stem, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its small, hard seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in harsh environments.</p>
