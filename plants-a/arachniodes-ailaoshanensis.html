<p>Arachniodes ailaoshanensis, commonly known as the Ailaoshan spider fern, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within montane forests. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the veins.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
