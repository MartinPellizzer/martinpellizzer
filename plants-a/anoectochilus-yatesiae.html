                    <h1>Anoectochilus yatesiae</h1>
<p>Anoectochilus yatesiae, commonly known as the Yate's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive slipper-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces delicate, hairy leaves that help it survive in its cool, shaded habitat. It thrives in humid, mossy environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
