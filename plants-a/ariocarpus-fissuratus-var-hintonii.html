                    <h1>Ariocarpus fissuratus var. hintonii</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus fissuratus var. hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's prickly pear, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a low-growing, compact plant. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
