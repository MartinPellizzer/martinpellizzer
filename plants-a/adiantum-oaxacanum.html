                <h1>Adiantum oaxacanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum oaxacanum, commonly known as the Oaxaca maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along streams or in forest understories. Its fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum oaxacanum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum oaxacanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, finely divided structure, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a smooth, glossy surface, and they can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, slightly greenish-brown bark that grows along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through dryness and wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum oaxacanum is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Southwest regions.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in humid, tropical, and subtropical environments within these areas. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum oaxacanum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. This fern is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lacy fronds. It is native to Mexico but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
