                <h1>Acronychia imperforata</h1>
<p>Acronychia imperforata, commonly known as the smooth-skin tree or the sandpaper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits.</p>
<p>Acronychia imperforata is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia imperforata has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia imperforata is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of eastern Australia. This plant typically grows in rainforest areas, often in shaded and moist environments. It is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the coastal and inland areas of the mentioned states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia imperforata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
