                            <h1>Astragalus Ranjbarii</h1>
<p>Ranjbar's milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus ranjbarii, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of central Asia. This legume belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and slender stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. The plant plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and supporting local pollinator populations. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure the survival of this unique and ecologically significant species.</p>
