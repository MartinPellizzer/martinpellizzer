                    <h1>Arethusa petraea</h1>
<p>Arethusa petraea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and its preference for rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip, which are typically arranged in a dense spike. Arethusa petraea is often found in crevices or on limestone formations, adapting to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
