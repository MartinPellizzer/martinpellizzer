                    <h1>Anthorrhiza chrysacantha</h1>
<p>Anthorrhiza chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive yellowish to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in its thallus. The plant forms a crust-like growth on tree bark or soil surfaces, often in temperate forest regions. It is characterized by its intricate network of filaments and the presence of apothecia that produce spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
