<p>Aspidium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium jenmanii plays a role in maintaining water quality and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
