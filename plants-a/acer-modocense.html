<p>Acer modocense, commonly known as Modoc maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Modoc Plateau in northeastern California.</p>
<p>This deciduous tree is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Acer modocense is considered a sensitive species and is protected in some areas.</p>
