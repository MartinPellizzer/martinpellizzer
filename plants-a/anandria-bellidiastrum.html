<p>Anandria bellidiastrum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nelumbonaceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a unique floating structure called a "helicopter," which helps it disperse its seeds across water bodies. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
