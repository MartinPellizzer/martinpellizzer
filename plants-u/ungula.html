                    <h1>Ungula</h1>
<p>Ungula, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, often brightly colored body and the presence of a long, muscular foot used for locomotion. The body is typically covered in a layer of mucus, which helps it glide smoothly over surfaces in its aquatic environment. Ungula species are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other plant matter found in coastal waters.</p>
<p>They play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the grazing of algae and maintaining the balance of their habitats.</p>
