<p>Utricularia spiricaulis, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate leaves that form specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in water or moist soil, and its stems often coil in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. Utricularia spiricaulis is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other aquatic and semi-aquatic carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and predatory mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
