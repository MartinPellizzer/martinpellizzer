                    <h1>Ulex aphyllus var. neglectus</h1>
<p>Ulex aphyllus var. neglectus, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves, which are often scale-like, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in waste places.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
