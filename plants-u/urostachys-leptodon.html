                    <h1>Urostachys leptodon</h1>
<p>Urostachys leptodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid and rocky environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urostachys leptodon is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
