                    <h1>Urbanoguarea sphenophylla</h1>
<p>Urbanoguarea sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf urban plant, is a unique species adapted to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact growth form, allowing it to survive in limited spaces such as sidewalks and building crevices. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that help reduce water loss in dry, polluted conditions. Its root system is resilient, capable of penetrating compacted soil and absorbing nutrients from polluted air.</p>
<p>Urbanoguarea sphenophylla plays a minor but significant role in urban ecology by contributing to air purification and providing habitat for small urban wildlife.</p>
