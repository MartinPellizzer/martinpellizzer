<p>Usteria non-scripta, commonly known as common water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in muddy or shallow waters, where it can spread via its rhizomes.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
