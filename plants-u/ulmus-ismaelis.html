                    <h1>Ulmus ismaelis</h1>
<p>Ulmus ismaelis, commonly known as the Ismael's elm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its limited seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now found in very few locations, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of plant ecology.</p>
