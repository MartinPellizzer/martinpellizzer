<p>Uncifera thailandica, commonly known as the Thai sword fern, is a tropical plant native to the forests of Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens.</p>
