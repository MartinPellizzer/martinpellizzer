                    <h1>Utricularia minor f. natans</h1>
<p>Utricularia minor f. natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic leaves that produce adhesive secretions to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique morphology includes tiny bladders that function as suction traps to capture prey.</p>
<p>This species is often used in botanical studies due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
