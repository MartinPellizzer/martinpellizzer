                    <h1>Urtica montana</h1>
<p>Urtica montana, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow,螫刺-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains a mixture of formic acid and histamine in its stinging hairs, which cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Urtica montana thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked.</p>
