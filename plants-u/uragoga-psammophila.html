<p>Uragoga psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
<p>Uragoga psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
