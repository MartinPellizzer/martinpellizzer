<p>Uragoga megapontica, commonly known as the Greek water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water.</p>
<p>Uragoga megapontica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
