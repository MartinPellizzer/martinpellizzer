<p>Uvaria cerasoides, commonly known as the red sanders or Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a luxury item in perfumery.</p>
