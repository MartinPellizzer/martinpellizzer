<p>Utricularia bolivarana, commonly known as the Bolivarian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water bodies, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Utricularia bolivarana is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
