<p>Urostigma globosum, commonly known as the globular bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, often submerged or floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Urostigma globosum typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is notable for its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition through carnivorous means.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure.</p>
