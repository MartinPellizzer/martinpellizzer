                    <h1>Ulex parviflorus var. canescens</h1>
<p>Ulex parviflorus var. canescens, commonly known as the silver burr or bracken burr, is a perennial shrub native to the western regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
