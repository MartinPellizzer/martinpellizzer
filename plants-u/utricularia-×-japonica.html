<p>Utricularia × japonica, commonly known as the Japanese bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water bodies, where it can thrive in both still and flowing conditions. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia × japonica is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is appreciated for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
