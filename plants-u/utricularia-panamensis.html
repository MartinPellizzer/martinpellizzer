<p>Utricularia panamensis, commonly known as the Panama bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it can float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia panamensis is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptive features that allow it to survive in its specific ecological niche.</p>
