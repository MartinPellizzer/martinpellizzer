                            <h1>Urtica Dioica Subsp. Subinermis</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica subsp. subinermis is a lesser-known variant of the stinging nettle known for its unique characteristics. Unlike its more common relative, this subspecies lacks the stinging hairs that typically irritate the skin. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are broader and more rounded, giving it a distinct appearance. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
