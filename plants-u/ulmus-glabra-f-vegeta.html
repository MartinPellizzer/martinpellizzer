                    <h1>Ulmus glabra f. vegeta</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra f. vegeta, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species.</p>
