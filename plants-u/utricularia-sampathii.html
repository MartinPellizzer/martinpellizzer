                    <h1>Utricularia sampathii</h1>
<p>Utricularia sampathii, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has delicate, floating leaves with fine, hair-like roots. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a single whorl at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Utricularia sampathii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of small aquatic invertebrates.</p>
