<p>Urostigma sulcipes, commonly known as the wavy-leaf bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds. Urostigma sulcipes is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often growing in shallow water or damp soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
