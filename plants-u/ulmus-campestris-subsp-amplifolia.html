<p>Ulmus campestris subsp.</p>
<p>amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf field elm, is a subspecies of the field elm native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions, though it is less common in modern landscapes compared to its historical prevalence.</p>
