                    <h1>Ulmus campestris lusus aspera</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris lusus aspera, commonly known as the rough field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with doubly serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>This species is relatively hardy but susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
