                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
