<p>Utricularia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia griffithii is native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It plays a unique ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems through its predatory behavior.</p>
