<p>Utricularia polyschista, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are usually finely divided and arranged in a whorled pattern, aiding in its buoyancy.</p>
<p>Utricularia polyschista is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
