<p>Uragoga guerzeensis, commonly known as the Guerzeensis uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a valuable subject for research in plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
