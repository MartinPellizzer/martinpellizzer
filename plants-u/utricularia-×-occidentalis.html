                    <h1>Utricularia × occidentalis</h1>
<p>Utricularia × occidentalis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia vulgaris and Utricularia gibba, exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap prey, primarily tiny aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study.</p>
