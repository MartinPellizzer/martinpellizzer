                    <h1>Utricularia stellaris var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Utricularia stellaris var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender star bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, thread-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, requiring high humidity and good water quality.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
