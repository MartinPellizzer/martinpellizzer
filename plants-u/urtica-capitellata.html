<p>Urtica capitellata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, irritating hairs that release histamine and other chemicals upon contact, causing skin irritation.</p>
<p>Urtica capitellata is native to Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland areas.</p>
