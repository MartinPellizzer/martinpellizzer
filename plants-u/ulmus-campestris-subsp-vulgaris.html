<p>Ulmus campestris subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The bark is gray and fissured, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
