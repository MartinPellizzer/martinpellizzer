                    <h1>Uvifera geniculata</h1>
<p>Uvifera geniculata, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Uvifera geniculata is also known for its edible leaves, which have a mildly acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
