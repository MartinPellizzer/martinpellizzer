                    <h1>Utricularia × brevicornis</h1>
<p>Utricularia × brevicornis, commonly known as the narrow-horned bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used for capturing prey, which are a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It has delicate, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Utricularia × brevicornis exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in regions where its parent species co-occur.</p>
