                    <h1>Ulmus × rasilis</h1>
<p>Ulmus × rasilis, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the European elm (U. minor).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, vase-shaped crown, which provides excellent shade. The tree has compound leaves with 3–5 pairs of serrated leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Ulmus × rasilis is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is less commonly cultivated today due to disease concerns.</p>
