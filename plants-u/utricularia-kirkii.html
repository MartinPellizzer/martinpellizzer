<p>Utricularia kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to trap prey such as water fleas and protozoa.</p>
<p>Utricularia kirkii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
