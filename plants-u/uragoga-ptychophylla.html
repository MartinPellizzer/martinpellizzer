<p>Uragoga ptychophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas.</p>
<p>Uragoga ptychophylla is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal vegetation.</p>
