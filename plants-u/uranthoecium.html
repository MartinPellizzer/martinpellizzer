<p>Uranthoecium, commonly known as the stamen.</p>
<p>It is the male reproductive organ of flowering plants, consisting of a filament and an anther. The anther produces and releases pollen grains, which contain the male gametes. The filament supports the anther and helps in positioning it for pollination.</p>
<p>The uranthoecium plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of angiosperms.</p>
