                    <h1>Ulmus × dampieri</h1>
<p>Ulmus × dampieri, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the slippery elm (Ulmus rubra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, drooping branches that create a graceful, open canopy. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This hybrid is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
<p>Its historical significance lies in its role as a landscape tree in North America before the emergence of more disease-resistant varieties.</p>
