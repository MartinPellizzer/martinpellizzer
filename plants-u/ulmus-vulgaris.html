<p>Ulmus vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits.</p>
<p>Ulmus vulgaris is known for its adaptability to various soil types but is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
