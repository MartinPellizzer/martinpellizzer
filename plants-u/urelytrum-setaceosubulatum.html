                    <h1>Urelytrum setaceosubulatum</h1>
<p>Urelytrum setaceosubulatum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Urelytrum setaceosubulatum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
