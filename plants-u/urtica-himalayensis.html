<p>Urtica himalayensis, commonly known as Himalayan nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants, making physical contact with the plant uncomfortable. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Urtica himalayensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
