<p>It features broad, ovate leaves with a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside. The tree typically grows in a rounded, dense form, providing dense shade due to its thick canopy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
