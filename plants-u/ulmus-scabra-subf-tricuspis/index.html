                            <h1>Ulmus Scabra Subf. Tricuspis</h1>
<p>The Ulmus scabra subf. tricuspis is a lesser-known member of the elm family known for its unique leaf structure. This subspecies is characterized by its three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from other elm varieties. Native to specific regions in Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Despite its ecological importance, it remains under-researched and often overlooked in horticultural circles. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a promising candidate for future botanical studies and landscape design.</p>
