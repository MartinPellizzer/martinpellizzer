                    <h1>Unona lucidula var. scandens</h1>
<p>Unona lucidula var. scandens, commonly known as the climbing rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is a fast-growing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>
