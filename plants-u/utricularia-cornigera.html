<p>Utricularia cornigera, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Utricularia cornigera thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often used in aquariums due to its ornamental value and unique trapping mechanism.</p>
