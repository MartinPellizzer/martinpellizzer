<p>Utricularia tenuiscapa, commonly known as the slender bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces delicate, floating leaves that help it float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia tenuiscapa is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
