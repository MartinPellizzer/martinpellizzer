                    <h1>Uraspermum aristatum var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Uraspermum aristatum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant's leaves are finely divided and often bear specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
