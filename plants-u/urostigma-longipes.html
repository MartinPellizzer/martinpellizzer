<p>Urostigma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>Urostigma longipes is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy or wetland habitats.</p>
