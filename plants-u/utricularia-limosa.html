                    <h1>Utricularia limosa</h1>
<p>Utricularia limosa, commonly known as the bog bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant features delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms. These bladders are filled with water and used to trap prey through a rapid suction mechanism.</p>
<p>Utricularia limosa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
