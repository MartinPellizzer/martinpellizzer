                    <h1>Utricularia × incerta</h1>
<p>Utricularia × incerta, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia aurea, two species native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap prey, enabling it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often floating or submerged.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Utricularia × incerta exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
