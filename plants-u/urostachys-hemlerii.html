<p>Urostachys hemlerii, commonly known as the hemler's rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for studying plant resilience in harsh climates.</p>
