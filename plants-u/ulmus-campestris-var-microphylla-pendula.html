                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. microphylla-pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. microphylla-pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its weeping growth habit.</p>
<p>It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, making it a visually striking ornamental tree. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a smooth texture, typically turning yellow in the fall. It is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival.</p>
