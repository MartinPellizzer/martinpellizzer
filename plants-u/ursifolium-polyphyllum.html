<p>Ursifolium polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved bear's foot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ursifolium polyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
