<p>Uragoga gardeniodes, commonly known as the golden moss orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features a slender, creeping stem with small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs. Its most striking feature is its clusters of golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
