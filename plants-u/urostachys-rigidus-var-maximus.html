                    <h1>Urostachys rigidus var. maximus</h1>
<p>Urostachys rigidus var. maximus, commonly known as the rigid goldenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of trichomes.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats.</p>
