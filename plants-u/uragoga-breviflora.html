                    <h1>Uragoga breviflora</h1>
<p>Uragoga breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered uragoga, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom during the late spring to early summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga breviflora is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
