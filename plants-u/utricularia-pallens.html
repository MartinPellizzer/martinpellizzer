<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its transparent, bladder-like structures that function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than a millimeter in size and are used to create a vacuum to draw in prey.</p>
