                    <h1>Urtica divaricata</h1>
<p>Urtica divaricata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, hollow hairs that release an irritating substance when touched. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Urtica divaricata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a food source, despite its defensive stinging properties.</p>
