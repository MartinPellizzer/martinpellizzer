                    <h1>Utricularia nelumbifolia var. macahensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia nelumbifolia var. macahensis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette, with each leaf having a central stalk and lateral branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on a separate stalk. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism involves bladder-like structures that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrients.</p>
