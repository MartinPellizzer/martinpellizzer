                    <h1>Utricularia × mutata</h1>
<p>Utricularia × mutata, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia vulgaris, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant features small, bladder-like traps that capture tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can float or root in moist soil.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
