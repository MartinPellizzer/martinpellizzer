                    <h1>Uniola simplex</h1>
<p>Uniola simplex, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Uniola simplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and wind.</p>
