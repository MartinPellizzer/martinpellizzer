                    <h1>Unigenes</h1>
<p>Unigenes, commonly known as single-copy genes, are unique DNA sequences that are transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins.</p>
<p>They are typically found in eukaryotic genomes and are less prone to duplication compared to other genes. Unigenes play a crucial role in gene expression studies due to their specificity and reliability. They are often used in molecular biology research to identify and analyze gene functions.</p>
<p>The study of unigenes contributes to understanding genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among species.</p>
