                    <h1>Urochloa chusqueoides</h1>
<p>Urochloa chusqueoides, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for erosion control and lawn use. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Urochloa chusqueoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to withstand heat and dry conditions.</p>
