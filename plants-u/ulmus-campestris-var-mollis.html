                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. mollis</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly lobed. The plant typically grows in open areas such as grasslands and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is less hardy than other elms and is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
