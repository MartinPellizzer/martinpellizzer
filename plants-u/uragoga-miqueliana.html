                    <h1>Uragoga miqueliana</h1>
<p>Uragoga miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's uragoga, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
