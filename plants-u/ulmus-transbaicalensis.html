                    <h1>Ulmus transbaicalensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Transbaikal area of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas along river valleys.</p>
