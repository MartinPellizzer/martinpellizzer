<p>Utricularia kalmaloensis, commonly known as the Kalmalo bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant produces specialized bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are typically thin and floating, with the bladders embedded in the leaf tissue.</p>
<p>Utricularia kalmaloensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
