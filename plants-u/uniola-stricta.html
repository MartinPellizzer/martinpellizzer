                    <h1>Uniola stricta</h1>
<p>Uniola stricta, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Uniola stricta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
