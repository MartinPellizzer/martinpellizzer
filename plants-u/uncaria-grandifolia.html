                    <h1>Uncaria grandifolia</h1>
<p>Uncaria grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions.</p>
