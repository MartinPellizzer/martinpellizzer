<p>Umbellulanthus, commonly known as the umbrella flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of small, yellow flowers arranged in a rounded shape. Umbellulanthus species are typically herbaceous perennials, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
