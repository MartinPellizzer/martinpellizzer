                    <h1>Uncinia</h1>
<p>Uncinia, commonly known as the "hooked grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and blade-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Uncinia species are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>They play a minor role in ecological systems but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphological features.</p>
