                    <h1>Uragoga macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Uragoga macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic prey. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like organs, which are used to capture and digest prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
