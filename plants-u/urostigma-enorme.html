<p>Urostigma enorme, commonly known as the giant bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is adapted to survive in waterlogged environments.</p>
