                    <h1>Ulmus gaussenii</h1>
<p>Ulmus gaussenii, commonly known as the Gaussen's elm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now found in very limited areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
