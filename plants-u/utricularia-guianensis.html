<p>Utricularia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are whorled and often submerged, while its flowers are small and typically yellow or green.</p>
<p>Utricularia guianensis is a fascinating example of adaptive evolution in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
