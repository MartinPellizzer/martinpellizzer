                    <h1>Ulmus campestris lusus laevis</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris lusus laevis, commonly known as the European field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
