                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. modiolina</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. modiolina, commonly known as the Weeping Elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit.</p>
<p>It features long, pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks, though it is relatively short-lived compared to other elm species.</p>
