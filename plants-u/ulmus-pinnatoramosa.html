                    <h1>Ulmus pinnatoramosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus pinnatoramosa, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The tree produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. It is relatively drought-tolerant and adaptable to various soil types, making it a hardy ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as ulmus bark beetle infestations, which can affect its longevity.</p>
