<p>Utricularia personata, commonly known as the bladderwurt, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow water environments, often found in marshes and ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by touch and are highly specialized for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>Utricularia personata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
