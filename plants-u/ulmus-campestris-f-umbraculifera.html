                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. umbraculifera</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spreading canopy and dark green foliage, which provides excellent shade. The leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to the parent species, enhancing its ornamental value. This form is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which limits its use in certain environments.</p>
