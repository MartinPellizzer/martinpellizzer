                    <h1>Ulmus carpinifolia var. dampieri</h1>
<p>Ulmus carpinifolia var. dampieri, commonly known as the Dampier's elm, is a rare and ancient variety of elm native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
