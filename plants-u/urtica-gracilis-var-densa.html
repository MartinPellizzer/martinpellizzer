                    <h1>Urtica gracilis var. densa</h1>
<p>Urtica gracilis var. densa, commonly known as the dense stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its dense arrangement of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in tiny, hollow, hair-like structures that release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
