<p>Urtica dentata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica dentata produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, spherical berries.</p>
