                    <h1>Urochloa polyphylla</h1>
<p>Urochloa polyphylla, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Urochloa polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and spreading habit.</p>
