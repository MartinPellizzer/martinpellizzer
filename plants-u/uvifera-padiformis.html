                    <h1>Uvifera padiformis</h1>
<p>Uvifera padiformis, commonly known as the pad-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, pad-like thallus that forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its entire body for nutrient absorption. Uvifera padiformis typically grows in humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental health.</p>
