<p>Utricularia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. Utricularia hirtella is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help in anchoring it in muddy substrates.</p>
