                    <h1>Ulmus laevis var. celtidea</h1>
<p>Ulmus laevis var. celtidea, commonly known as the Celtic elm, is a rare variant of the Wych elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and river valleys.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to Dutch elm disease, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
