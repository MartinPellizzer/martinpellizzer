                    <h1>Urtica platyphylla</h1>
<p>Urtica platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Urtica platyphylla is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
