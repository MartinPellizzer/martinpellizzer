                    <h1>Uragoga verrucosa</h1>
<p>Uragoga verrucosa, commonly known as the warty bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are often submerged, and it uses specialized glands to secrete digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>Uragoga verrucosa is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition.</p>
