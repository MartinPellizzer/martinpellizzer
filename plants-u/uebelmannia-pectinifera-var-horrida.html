                    <h1>Uebelmannia pectinifera var. horrida</h1>
<p>Uebelmannia pectinifera var. horrida, commonly known as the hairy pectinifera, is a rare bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, spiky leaves that give it a distinctive, almost bristly appearance. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
