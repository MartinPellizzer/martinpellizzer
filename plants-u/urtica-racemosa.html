                    <h1>Urtica racemosa</h1>
<p>Urtica racemosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems that release irritant chemicals upon contact, causing a stinging sensation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica racemosa has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p>
