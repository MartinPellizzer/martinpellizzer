                    <h1>Utricularia striatula var. minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia striatula var. minor, commonly known as the lesser striped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in temperate regions. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap small aquatic organisms for nourishment. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, with a distinctive striped pattern that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than other bladderworts but is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
