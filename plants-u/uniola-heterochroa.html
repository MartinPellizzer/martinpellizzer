                    <h1>Uniola heterochroa</h1>
<p>Uniola heterochroa, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, showcasing adaptations to salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to grayish flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
