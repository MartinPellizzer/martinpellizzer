<p>Urelytrum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with short, branched stems.</p>
<p>Urelytrum fasciculatum is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the food web and water filtration.</p>
