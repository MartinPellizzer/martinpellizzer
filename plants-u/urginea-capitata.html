<p>Urginea capitata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a single, large inflorescence at the top of the stem, which consists of multiple overlapping flowers. Its bulbous base stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Urginea capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
