                    <h1>Urostigma circumscissum</h1>
<p>Urostigma circumscissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green in color. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops if left unchecked.</p>
