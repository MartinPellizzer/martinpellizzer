<p>Utricularia pusilla var. itapavensis, commonly known as the Itapava bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its morphology includes slender stems and small, translucent bladders that aid in nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to low-light conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems as a predator of microorganisms.</p>
