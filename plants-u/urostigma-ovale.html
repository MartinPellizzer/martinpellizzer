<p>Urostigma ovale, commonly known as the oval bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, submerged leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with flowers that are often submerged and not easily visible.</p>
<p>Urostigma ovale plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
