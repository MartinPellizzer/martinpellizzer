                    <h1>Uragoga microcarpa</h1>
<p>Uragoga microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf uragoga, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga microcarpa is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
