<p>Ulmus cebennensis, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a species of elm native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15â€“25 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The bark is gray and fissured, while the leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is known for its resilience but has been affected by Dutch elm disease.</p>
