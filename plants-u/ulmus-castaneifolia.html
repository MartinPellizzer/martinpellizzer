                    <h1>Ulmus castaneifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus castaneifolia, commonly known as the Persian elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobed and have a distinctive castanea-like appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth when young but becomes deeply furrowed with age, giving it a rugged appearance.</p>
