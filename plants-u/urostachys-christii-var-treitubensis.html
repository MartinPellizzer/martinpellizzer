                    <h1>Urostachys christii var. treitubensis</h1>
<p>Urostachys christii var. treitubensis, commonly known as the Treitubens mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sun-exposed areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its mountainous environment.</p>
