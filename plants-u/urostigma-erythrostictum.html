                    <h1>Urostigma erythrostictum</h1>
<p>Urostigma erythrostictum, commonly known as the red-streaked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Urostigma erythrostictum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
