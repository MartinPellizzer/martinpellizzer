<p>Utricularia olygosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. This carnivorous plant thrives in nutrient-poor freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive bilabiate structure.</p>
<p>Utricularia olygosperma plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
