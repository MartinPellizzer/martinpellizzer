                    <h1>Urospermum</h1>
<p>Urospermum, commonly known as the goatweed or yellow star-thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are found in arid and semi-arid regions. Urospermum species typically have hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. They are often considered invasive in some regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's name comes from the Greek words "uro-" meaning urine and "spermos" meaning seed, referring to its historical use in treating urinary disorders.</p>
