                    <h1>Urtica canadensis</h1>
<p>Urtica canadensis, commonly known as Canadian nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in woodlands, stream banks, and meadows. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often covered in fine, white veins.</p>
<p>Urtica canadensis produces small, greenish flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
