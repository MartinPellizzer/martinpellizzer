                    <h1>Uncifera maxilla-leonis</h1>
<p>Uncifera maxilla-leonis, commonly known as the lion's jaw fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, claw-like fronds that resemble the jaw of a lion.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant thrives in rocky soils and has adapted to withstand periods of drought through its thick, waxy leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
