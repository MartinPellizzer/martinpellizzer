                    <h1>Ulmus americana var. glabra</h1>
<p>Ulmus americana var. glabra, commonly known as the American elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its broad, spreading crown with elongated, heart-shaped leaves. The tree is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>However, it is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
