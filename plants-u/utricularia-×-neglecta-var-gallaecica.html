                    <h1>Utricularia × neglecta var. gallaecica</h1>
<p>Utricularia × neglecta var. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician Bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems may be partially emergent, allowing for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to adapt to varying water conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
