                    <h1>Ulmus sieboldii f. shirasawana</h1>
<p>Ulmus sieboldii f. shirasawana, commonly known as the Japanese cliff elm, is a rare and ornamental tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring form of the Japanese elm, characterized by its unique, twisted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant exhibits small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture and displays a striking contrast between its dark green upper surface and lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
