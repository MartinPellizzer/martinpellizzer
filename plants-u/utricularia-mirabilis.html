<p>Utricularia mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These utricles are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment.</p>
<p>Utricularia mirabilis is known for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various water conditions.</p>
