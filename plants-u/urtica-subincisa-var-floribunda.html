                    <h1>Urtica subincisa var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Urtica subincisa var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritants, are present on both the leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive mechanisms, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
