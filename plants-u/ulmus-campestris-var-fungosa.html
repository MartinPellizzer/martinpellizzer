                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. fungosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. fungosa, commonly known as the black elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, pendulous catkins in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
