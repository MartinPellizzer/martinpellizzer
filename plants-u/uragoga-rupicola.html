                    <h1>Uragoga rupicola</h1>
<p>Uragoga rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color, which help it blend into its natural habitat. Uragoga rupicola is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it survives in cool, dry conditions with limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
