                    <h1>Urochloa fasciculata</h1>
<p>Urochloa fasciculata, commonly known as finger grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
