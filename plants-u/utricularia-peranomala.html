<p>Utricularia peranomala, commonly known as the red-rooted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its roots are often red or orange in color, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Utricularia peranomala relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
