                    <h1>Utricularia calliphysa</h1>
<p>Utricularia calliphysa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia calliphysa typically grows in dense mats on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
