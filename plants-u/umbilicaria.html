                    <h1>Umbilicaria</h1>
<p>Umbilicaria, commonly known as the "umbilical lichen," is a genus of foliose lichens characterized by their leaf-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>These lichens typically grow on rock surfaces in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Their distinctive feature is the central umbilical pit, a depression at the center of each leaf-like lobule. Umbilicaria species are known for their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, which allows them to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as indicators of air quality.</p>
