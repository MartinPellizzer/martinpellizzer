<p>Ulmus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal elm, is a species of flowering plant in the elm family, Ulmaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions such as Virginia and North Carolina. The tree is characterized by its tall, slender form and drooping branches, which give it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The pyramidal elm is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and along streets for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
