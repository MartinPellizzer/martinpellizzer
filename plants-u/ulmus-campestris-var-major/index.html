                            <h1>Ulmus Campestris Var. Major</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. major, commonly known as the field elm, is a hardy deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. This variant of the field elm is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Its historical significance includes use in ancient Roman times for timber and shade. Today, it remains a valued ornamental and ecological tree in many landscapes.</p>
