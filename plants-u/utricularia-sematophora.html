<p>Utricularia sematophora, commonly known as the arrowhead bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are thin and delicate, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Utricularia sematophora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
