                    <h1>Ulmus montana f. exoniensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana f. exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter elm, is a rare and ancient variant of the wych elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled growth habit, which gives it a striking appearance. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough upper surface and a lighter green underside. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance, often found in old gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
