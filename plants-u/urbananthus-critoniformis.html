                <h1>Urbananthus critoniformis</h1>
<p>Urbananthus critoniformis, commonly known as the cityscape flameflower, is a unique urban-adapted plant that thrives in disturbed environments such as sidewalks and construction sites.</p>
<p>It features striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its roots are fibrous and capable of stabilizing soil in urban areas prone to erosion.</p>
<p>Despite its resilience, it is considered a rare species with limited natural distribution.</p>
