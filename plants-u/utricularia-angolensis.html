                    <h1>Utricularia angolensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Utricularia angolensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations.</p>
