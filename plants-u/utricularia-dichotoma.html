<p>Utricularia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces tiny bladders, or trap-like structures, which capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia dichotoma is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of wetland conditions.</p>
