                    <h1>Ulmus foliosa var. wheatleyi</h1>
<p>Ulmus foliosa var. wheatleyi, commonly known as the Desert Willow, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, round fruits that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
