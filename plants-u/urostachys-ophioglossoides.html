                    <h1>Urostachys ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Urostachys ophioglossoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
