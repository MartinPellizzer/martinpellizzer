                    <h1>Ulmus americana f. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus americana f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender trunk with long, drooping branches that create a graceful, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This cultivar is known for its ornamental value and is often planted in parks and along streets.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas.</p>
