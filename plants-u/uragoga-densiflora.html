                    <h1>Uragoga densiflora</h1>
<p>Uragoga densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered uragoga, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing white or pale yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>Uragoga densiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
