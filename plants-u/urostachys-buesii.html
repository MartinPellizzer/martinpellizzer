                    <h1>Urostachys buesii</h1>
<p>Urostachys buesii, commonly known as the Buesii carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Urostachys buesii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
