<p>Urtica incisa var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's more prominent foliage.</p>
<p>The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
