                    <h1>Urochloa stolonifera</h1>
<p>Urochloa stolonifera, commonly known as silverleaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which involves horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery appearance due to the fine pubescence on the leaf surfaces. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>Urochloa stolonifera is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
