                    <h1>Urachne sinaica</h1>
<p>Urachne sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai urachne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Urachne sinaica plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for small insects and animals.</p>
