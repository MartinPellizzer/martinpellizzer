                    <h1>Uragoga lecomtei var. nimbana</h1>
<p>Uragoga lecomtei var. nimbana, commonly known as the Nimbana orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically elongated and革质 (leathery), adapting to its climbing habit and moisture retention needs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
