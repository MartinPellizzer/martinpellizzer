                    <h1>Uragoga herbacea</h1>
<p>Uragoga herbacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga herbacea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
