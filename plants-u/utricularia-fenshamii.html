                    <h1>Utricularia fenshamii</h1>
<p>Utricularia fenshamii, commonly known as the Fensham's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetland environments. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studying carnivorous plant adaptations.</p>
