                    <h1>Utricularia × bentensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia × bentensis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia aurea, combining traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. These bladders are typically less than 1 mm in size and are equipped with a sensitive trigger to capture tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia × bentensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
