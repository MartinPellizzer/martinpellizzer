                    <h1>Ulmus dentata</h1>
<p>Ulmus dentata, commonly known as the warty sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that becomes deeply fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, often appearing heart-shaped at the base. It produces small, greenish flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shady habitats such as stream valleys and forest understories.</p>
