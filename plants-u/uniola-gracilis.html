                    <h1>Uniola gracilis</h1>
<p>Uniola gracilis, commonly known as slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Uniola gracilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
