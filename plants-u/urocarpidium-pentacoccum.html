<p>Urocarpidium pentacoccum, commonly known as the five-celled spore moss, is a rare and specialized member of the moss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate structure and unique reproductive features, including the production of five-celled spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a short, upright stem with spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and pointed.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is of interest due to its primitive features and potential ecological significance in certain microhabitats.</p>
