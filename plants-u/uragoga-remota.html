                    <h1>Uragoga remota</h1>
<p>Uragoga remota, commonly known as the remote uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and dense, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the short growing season in late spring. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in steep, inaccessible terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga remota is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
