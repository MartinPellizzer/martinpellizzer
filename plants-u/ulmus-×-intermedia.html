                    <h1>Ulmus × intermedia</h1>
<p>Ulmus × intermedia, commonly known as the American hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra), resulting in a tree with enhanced resistance to Dutch elm disease. The plant features a broad, spreading crown with serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Ulmus × intermedia is valued for its fast growth and ornamental appeal in urban landscapes.</p>
