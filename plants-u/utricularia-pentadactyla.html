                    <h1>Utricularia pentadactyla</h1>
<p>Utricularia pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are triggered by water movement and allow the plant to absorb nutrients from captured organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia pentadactyla is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
