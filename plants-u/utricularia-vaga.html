<p>Utricularia vaga, commonly known as the wandering bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia vaga is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
