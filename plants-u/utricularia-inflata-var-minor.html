                    <h1>Utricularia inflata var. minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia inflata var. minor, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. This variety typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized leaves for anchoring and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
