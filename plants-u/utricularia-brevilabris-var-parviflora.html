                    <h1>Utricularia brevilabris var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Utricularia brevilabris var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey. This variety typically grows in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its small, white flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has slender, branched stems covered in fine, delicate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to low-nutrient conditions, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients.</p>
