<p>Unonopsis buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's unon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheat. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
