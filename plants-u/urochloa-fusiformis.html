                    <h1>Urochloa fusiformis</h1>
<p>Urochloa fusiformis, commonly known as fingergrass, is a tropical and subtropical perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Urochloa fusiformis is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in dry conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is also used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization due to its rapid growth and extensive root system.</p>
