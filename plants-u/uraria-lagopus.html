                    <h1>Uraria lagopus</h1>
<p>Uraria lagopus, commonly known as the silverleaf uraria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that disperse easily by wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Uraria lagopus is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can often be found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
