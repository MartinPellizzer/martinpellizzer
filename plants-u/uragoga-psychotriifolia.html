                    <h1>Uragoga psychotriifolia</h1>
<p>Uragoga psychotriifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate, veined petals. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Uragoga psychotriifolia is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
