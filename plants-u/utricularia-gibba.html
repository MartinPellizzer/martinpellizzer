<p>Utricularia gibba, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Utricularia gibba has a highly branched structure with whorled leaves that aid in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
