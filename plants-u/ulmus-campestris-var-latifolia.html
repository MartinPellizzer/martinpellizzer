                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length. The tree has a straight, cylindrical trunk and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its foliage is dense and provides good shade, making it suitable for ornamental planting.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
