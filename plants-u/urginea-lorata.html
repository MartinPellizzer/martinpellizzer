<p>Urginea lorata, commonly known as the naked lady, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a cluster of fleshy, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from a single stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, appearing after the flowers have bloomed.</p>
