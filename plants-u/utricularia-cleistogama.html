                    <h1>Utricularia cleistogama</h1>
<p>Utricularia cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia cleistogama produces closed, non-showy flowers, a trait known as cleistogamy, which facilitates self-pollination.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an intriguing subject for studying plant evolution and ecological niche specialization.</p>
