                    <h1>Urophyllum oligophlebium</h1>
<p>Urophyllum oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined everlet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves with tightly packed, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
