                    <h1>Urginea bakeri</h1>
<p>Urginea bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's giant lily, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of pink to white. The plant produces a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea bakeri is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators.</p>
