                    <h1>Uebelmannia</h1>
<p>Uebelmannia, commonly known as the giant ground orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers and are typically found in high-altitude environments. Uebelmannia species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. They have thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to their arid habitats.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral displays.</p>
