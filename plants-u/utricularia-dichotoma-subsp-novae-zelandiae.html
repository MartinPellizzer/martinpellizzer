<p>Utricularia dichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, branching stems with tiny bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, pale flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to its native environment and its role in local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
