                    <h1>Urophysa</h1>
<p>Urophysa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Urophysa thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments such as pine rocklands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and endangered status, it is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
