<p>Ulmus campestris var. major, commonly known as the field elm, is a variant of the European elm native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dull green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
