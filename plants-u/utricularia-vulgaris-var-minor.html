                    <h1>Utricularia vulgaris var. minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in shallow water bodies and moist soils. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic prey. These utricles are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from captured organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes whorled leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color.</p>
