<p>Uragoga keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal hammocks and wetlands. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Uragoga keyensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
