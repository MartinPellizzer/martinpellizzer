<p>Ulmus carpinifolia var. glandulosa is a lesser-known species of elm native to parts of eastern europe and western asia. it is characterized by its distinctive glandular leaves and rugged, often twisted growth habit. this variety is closely related to the common wych elm but differs in its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences. due to its hardiness and ecological significance, it has gained interest among botanists and conservationists. its survival in fragmented landscapes highlights the importance of preserving such rare plant species.</p>
