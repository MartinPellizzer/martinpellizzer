<p>Utricularia macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, often in wetlands or ponds. Its leaves are usually broad and floating, with the bladders attached to the leaf stalks.</p>
<p>Utricularia macrolepis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates.</p>
