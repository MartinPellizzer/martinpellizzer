                    <h1>Uniola</h1>
<p>Uniola, commonly known as grass or sea oats, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal and sandy environments, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Uniola species are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Uniola paniculata and Uniola torrida, which vary in size and habitat preferences.</p>
