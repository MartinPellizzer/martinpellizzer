                    <h1>Urostigma pseudobenjaminum</h1>
<p>Urostigma pseudobenjaminum, commonly known as the Benjamin's false grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a source of forage for small herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>
