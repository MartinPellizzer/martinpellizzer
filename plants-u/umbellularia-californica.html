<p>Umbellularia californica, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and disease.</p>
<p>The Pacific yew is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years.</p>
