<p>Utricularia canacorum, commonly known as the Cape waterwheel, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique whorled arrangement of leaves that form a floating structure, with small bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Utricularia canacorum is an important species for studying aquatic plant adaptations and nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
