                    <h1>Uncinia tenella var. longifructus</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Uncia tenella var. longifructus, commonly known as the long-fruited hookweed, is a variant of the hookweed species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces elongated, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its fruiting structures are notably longer than those of the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet "longifructus.".</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
