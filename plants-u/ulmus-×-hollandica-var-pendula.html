                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a unique, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is native to Europe, where it was developed through crossbreeding between the wych elm and the American elm. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are medium to dark green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and is often cultivated in parks and gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
