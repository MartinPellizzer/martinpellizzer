<p>Urostigma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved urostigma, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Urostigma angustifolium is often found in wetland habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
