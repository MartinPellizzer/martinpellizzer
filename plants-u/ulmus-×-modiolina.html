                    <h1>Ulmus × modiolina</h1>
<p>Ulmus × modiolina, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and moderate growth rate, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
