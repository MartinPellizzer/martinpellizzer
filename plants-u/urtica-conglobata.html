<p>Urtica conglobata, commonly known as the clustered nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Urtica conglobata produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually pollinated by wind.</p>
