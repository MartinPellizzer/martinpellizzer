                    <h1>Utricularia circumvoluta</h1>
<p>Utricularia circumvoluta, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that curl around its stem, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant possesses small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. These utricles are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create a suction that captures prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia circumvoluta is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
