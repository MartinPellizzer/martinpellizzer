<p>Urticastrum stimulans, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Urticastrum stimulans plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
