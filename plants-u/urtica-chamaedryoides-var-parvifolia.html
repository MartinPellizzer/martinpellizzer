                    <h1>Urtica chamaedryoides var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica chamaedryoides var. parvifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically borne on erect, branched stems. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
