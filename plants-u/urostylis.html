<p>Urostylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, often in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Urostylis species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate orchid flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. They produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>The genus includes around 15 species, many of which are rare or endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
