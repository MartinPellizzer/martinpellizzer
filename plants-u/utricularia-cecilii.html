                    <h1>Utricularia cecilii</h1>
<p>Utricularia cecilii, commonly known as the Cecil's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing microorganisms to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often floating or submerged, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Utricularia cecilii is native to parts of Africa and is known for its delicate, ephemeral flowers that bloom in the early morning.</p>
