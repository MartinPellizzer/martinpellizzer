<p>Utricularia inflexa var. major, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or partially submerged.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its larger size compared to other species in the Utricularia genus.</p>
