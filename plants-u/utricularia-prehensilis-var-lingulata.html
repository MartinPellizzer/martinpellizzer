                    <h1>Utricularia prehensilis var. lingulata</h1>
<p>Utricularia prehensilis var. lingulata, commonly known as the clawed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture aquatic invertebrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that often form dense mats in shallow water. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems bear the specialized trapping organs.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
