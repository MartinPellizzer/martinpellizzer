                    <h1>Utricularia furcellata var. minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia furcellata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that support its unique hunting mechanism.</p>
