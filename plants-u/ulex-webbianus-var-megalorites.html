                    <h1>Ulex webbianus var. megalorites</h1>
<p>Ulex webbianus var. megalorites, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
