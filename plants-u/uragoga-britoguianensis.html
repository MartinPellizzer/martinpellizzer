                    <h1>Uragoga britoguianensis</h1>
<p>Uragoga britoguianensis, commonly known as the Britoguan mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in high humidity and partial shade, making it well adapted to its misty, mountainous habitat. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths and early-flying bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
