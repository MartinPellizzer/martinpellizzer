<p>Utricularia gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement and contain a vacuum that sucks in prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia gracilis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize various water bodies, making it a common species in temperate regions.</p>
