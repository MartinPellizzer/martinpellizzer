                    <h1>Utricularia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Utricularia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrition. These traps are usually less than 1 mm in size and are used to trap prey such as water fleas and protozoa.</p>
<p>Utricularia fasciculata is often found in dense clusters, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
