                    <h1>Ulmus stricta var. goodyeri</h1>
<p>Ulmus stricta var. goodyeri, commonly known as the Goodyer's elm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree with a narrow, columnar growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant has distinctive bark that is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged samaras.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and has been heavily impacted by Dutch elm disease.</p>
