                    <h1>Urtica atlantica</h1>
<p>Urtica atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants, making physical contact with the plant painful. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often in tidal areas or near freshwater sources. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Urtica atlantica plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
