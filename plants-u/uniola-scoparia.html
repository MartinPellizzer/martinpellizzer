                <h1>Uniola scoparia</h1>
<p>Uniola scoparia, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial plant that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along dunes and salt marshes. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and frequent flooding, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
