<p>Utricularia dichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>aquilonia, commonly known as the aquatic bladderwort, is a small, semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The plant features a prostrate or erect growth habit with slender, branching stems that bear small, floating leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping microscopic prey.</p>
<p>These bladders are a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
