                    <h1>Utricularia vulgaris proles major</h1>
<p>Utricularia vulgaris proles major, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for tiny aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments, supplementing its nutritional needs through captured prey.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of carnivorous plant adaptations.</p>
