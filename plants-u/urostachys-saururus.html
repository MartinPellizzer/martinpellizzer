                <h1>Urostachys saururus</h1>
<p>Urostachys saururus, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Urostachys saururus is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
