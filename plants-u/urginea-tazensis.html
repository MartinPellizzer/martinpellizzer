                    <h1>Urginea tazensis</h1>
<p>Urginea tazensis, commonly known as the Tazentian bulb, is a rare plant native to the Tazza region of Libya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its large, fleshy bulb that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the bulb.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urginea tazensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
