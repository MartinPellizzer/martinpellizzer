                    <h1>Urceolina urceolata</h1>
<p>Urceolina urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped thallus, which is typically green and grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, lobed structure called a thallus. Urceolina urceolata is often found in rocky or soil-covered areas, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important indicator species for certain habitats.</p>
