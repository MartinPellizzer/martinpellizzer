<p>Urtica membranacea var. subinermis, commonly known as the soft nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle characterized by its reduced stinging hairs.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Asia and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth, velvety texture and are often covered in fine, non-irritating hairs. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
