<p>Urochloa grass, scientifically known as Urochloa mauritiana, is a hardy perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in warm climates and is commonly found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed soils. This plant is valued for its high forage quality and ability to withstand drought and grazing pressure. Urochloa mauritiana is also used in erosion control and as a component in turfgrass mixtures. Its versatility and resilience make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
