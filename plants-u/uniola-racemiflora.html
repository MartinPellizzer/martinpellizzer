<p>Uniola racemiflora, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion along coastal areas.</p>
