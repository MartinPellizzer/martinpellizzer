<p>Uragoga brachypoda, commonly known as the shortstem burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that contain seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to its habitat in dry, open areas.</p>
<p>Uragoga brachypoda plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insect and small animal species.</p>
