                    <h1>Umbilicus gaditanus var. giganteus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus gaditanus var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant umbilicaria, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Umbilicariaceae and is distinguished by its large, plate-like thallus that can reach several centimeters in diameter. The lichen's structure consists of a central umbilicate (central pit) surrounded by a rim, which is a key feature of the genus Umbilicaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on decaying wood or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its robust growth and is often found in Mediterranean regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance.</p>
