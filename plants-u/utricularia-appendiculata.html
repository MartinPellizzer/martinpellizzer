<p>Utricularia appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are often found in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Utricularia appendiculata is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
