                    <h1>Utricularia hirta var. elongata</h1>
<p>Utricularia hirta var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stalked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Utricularia hirta var. elongata is a submerged or floating aquatic plant, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
