<p>Unona boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Unona boivinii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
