                    <h1>Utricularia clandestina</h1>
<p>Utricularia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost hornwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia clandestina is native to parts of Africa and is often found in marshy habitats, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
