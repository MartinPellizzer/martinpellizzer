<p>Urophyllum klaineanum, commonly known as the Klaineanum uruphyllo, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, with deep lobes extending from a central stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
