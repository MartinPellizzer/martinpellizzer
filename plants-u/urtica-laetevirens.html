<p>Urtica laetevirens, commonly known as the green nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica laetevirens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
