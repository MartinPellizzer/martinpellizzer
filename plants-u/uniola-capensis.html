                    <h1>Uniola capensis</h1>
<p>Uniola capensis, commonly known as coastal grass or Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
