                    <h1>Uncasia pallescens</h1>
<p>Uncasia pallescens, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Uncasia pallescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species that consume its berries.</p>
