                    <h1>Urostigma myxifolium</h1>
<p>Urostigma myxifolium, commonly known as the swamp bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, fleshy, bladder-like leaves that help it retain moisture in saturated soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Urostigma myxifolium is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
