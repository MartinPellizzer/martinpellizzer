                    <h1>Ulmus laevigata</h1>
<p>Ulmus laevigata, commonly known as the plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Ulmus laevigata is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically in furniture and construction.</p>
