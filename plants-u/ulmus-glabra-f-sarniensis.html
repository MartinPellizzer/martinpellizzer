                    <h1>Ulmus glabra f. sarniensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra f. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian elm, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Wych elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, gnarled trunk and thick, flaky bark that gives it a rugged appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard Wych elm, with a serrated margin. This form is native to a small region in the Carpathian Mountains and is considered a relict population.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
