The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure.</p>
