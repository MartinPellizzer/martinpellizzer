                    <h1>Ulmus × pseudobovata</h1>
<p>Ulmus × pseudobovata, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the bark is smooth and light grey in younger trees.</p>
<p>This species is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance to pollution and compact size.</p>
