                    <h1>Ulmus suberosa var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus suberosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard boxelder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests.</p>
