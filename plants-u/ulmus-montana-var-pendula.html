                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a cultivar of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant, drooping foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are heart-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
