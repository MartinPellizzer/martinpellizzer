                    <h1>Utricularia minima</h1>
<p>Utricularia minima, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for capturing microscopic prey. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Utricularia minima is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped organisms.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
