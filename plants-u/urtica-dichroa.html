<p>Urtica dichroa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hollow hairs that release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica dichroa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its entire plant is covered in stinging hairs, making it both a defensive mechanism and a source of traditional herbal remedies.</p>
