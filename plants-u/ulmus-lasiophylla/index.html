                            <h1>Ulmus Lasiophylla</h1>
<p>American elm, scientifically known as Ulmus lasiophylla, is a tall, stately tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and distinctive heart-shaped leaves. Once a dominant species in eastern forests, it has faced significant decline due to Dutch elm disease. Despite its historical importance, the American elm remains a symbol of resilience and beauty in the landscape. Conservation efforts continue to strive for its recovery and preservation.</p>
