                    <h1>Ulloa parasitica</h1>
<p>Ulloa parasitica, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries that contain seeds. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in certain forest ecosystems.</p>
