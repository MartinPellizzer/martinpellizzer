                    <h1>Uragoga bicolariceps</h1>
<p>Uragoga bicolariceps, commonly known as the two-horned grass, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
