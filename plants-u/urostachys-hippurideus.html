<p>Urostachys hippurideus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor deeply in sandy soils, enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Urostachys hippurideus plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
