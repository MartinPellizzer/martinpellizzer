<p>Uniola ciliata, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for dune formation and erosion control.</p>
<p>Uniola ciliata is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, thriving in coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>
