<p>Urtica gracilis var. holosericea, commonly known as the silky stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its fine, soft hairs that cover its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the undersides are covered in tiny, hollow stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The flowers are small and greenish, clustered in dense spikes, and the plant produces small, pale berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stabilization.</p>
