<p>Utricularia pulchra, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Utricularia pulchra relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured aquatic organisms.</p>
