                    <h1>Urostachys fontinaloides var. adpressa</h1>
<p>Urostachys fontinaloides var. adpressa, commonly known as the creeping water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-rich, soft water conditions and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
