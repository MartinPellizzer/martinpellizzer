<p>Utricularia odontosperma, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to trap prey such as protozoa and small crustaceans.</p>
<p>Utricularia odontosperma is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and it is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
