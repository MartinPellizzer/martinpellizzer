<p>Utania morindifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 15-25 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib.
