                    <h1>Urginea rubella</h1>
<p>Urginea rubella, commonly known as the red-stalked African giant lily, is a striking member of the Alstroemeriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy purple or reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Urginea rubella is also known for its strong, musky scent, which attracts pollinators like moths and beetles.</p>
