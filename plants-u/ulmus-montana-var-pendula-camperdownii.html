                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. pendula-camperdownii</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. pendula-camperdownii, commonly known as the Weeping Elm, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a weeping effect.</p>
<p>It is a cultivar of the Wych Elm, native to Europe, and is known for its heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, though it is often pruned to maintain a compact form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as elm bark beetle infestations, which can pose a threat to its longevity.</p>
