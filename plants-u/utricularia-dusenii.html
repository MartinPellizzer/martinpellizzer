<p>Utricularia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Utricularia dusenii is an example of the diverse adaptations found in the genus Utricularia, which includes both aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
