                    <h1>Urospatha edwallii</h1>
<p>Urospatha edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
