                    <h1>Uniola laxa</h1>
<p>Uniola laxa, commonly known as coastal grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal areas.</p>
