                    <h1>Urophyllum lineatum</h1>
<p>Urophyllum lineatum, commonly known as the slender leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a smooth, waxy stem with a tendency to branch out as it matures.</p>
<p>Urophyllum lineatum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
