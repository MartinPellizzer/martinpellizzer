                <h1>Ulmus campestris</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is less commonly cultivated in modern landscapes.</p>
