                    <h1>Ulmus nitens var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus nitens var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a striking cultivar of the elm tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, fountain-like appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is a smaller, more compact tree compared to its upright counterparts, with a broad, spreading canopy that adds ornamental value to landscapes. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, providing visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for urban environments and smaller gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as Dutch elm disease, which can pose a challenge to its longevity.</p>
