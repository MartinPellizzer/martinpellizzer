<p>Uncaria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cat's claw, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and hirsute (hairy) appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with serrated margins.</p>
<p>Uncaria hirsuta is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
