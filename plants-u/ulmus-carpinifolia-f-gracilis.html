                    <h1>Ulmus carpinifolia f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Ulmus carpinifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender field elm, is a rare and unique variant of the field elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical field elm. This form exhibits a distinct morphology, with slender branches and a generally more upright structure. It is often found in specific microhabitats, such as dry, open areas or along the edges of woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
