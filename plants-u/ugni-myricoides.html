                    <h1>Ugni myricoides</h1>
<p>Ugni myricoides, commonly known as the Andean huckleberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, and thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by edible berries that range in color from red to black. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Ugni myricoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine.</p>
