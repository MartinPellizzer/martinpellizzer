                    <h1>Ulmus pumila var. gracia</h1>
<p>Ulmus pumila var. gracia, commonly known as the Japanese elm or Gracia elm, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as elm bark beetle infestations, which can threaten its survival.</p>
