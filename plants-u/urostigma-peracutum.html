                    <h1>Urostigma peracutum</h1>
<p>Urostigma peracutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is typically found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host species.</p>
