                    <h1>Ulex parviflorus f. delestrei</h1>
<p>Ulex parviflorus f. delestrei, commonly known as the creeping sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
