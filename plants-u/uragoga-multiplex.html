<p>Uragoga multiplex, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are often clustered together. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as swamps and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to capture and digest small aquatic organisms for nutrients.</p>
