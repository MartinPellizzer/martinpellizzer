                    <h1>Urginea littoralis</h1>
<p>Urginea littoralis, commonly known as the sea onion, is a bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Urginea littoralis is adapted to coastal conditions, with a thick cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
