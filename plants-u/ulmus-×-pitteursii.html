                    <h1>Ulmus × pitteursii</h1>
<p>Ulmus × pitteursii, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus laevis).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree is highly adaptable, thriving in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a papery husk, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ulmus × pitteursii is widely planted as an ornamental and shade tree in cities around the world.</p>
