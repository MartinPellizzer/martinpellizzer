<p>Urtica glandulifera, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences. Urtica glandulifera thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators and has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties.</p>
