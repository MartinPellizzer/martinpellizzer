<p>Unona ferruginea, commonly known as the rust fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are often covered in a rusty-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Unona ferruginea is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
