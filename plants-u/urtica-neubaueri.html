<p>Urtica neubaueri, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Urtica neubaueri is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of Andean flora and ecological adaptations.</p>
