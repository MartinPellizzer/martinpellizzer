                    <h1>Urceola elastica</h1>
<p>Urceola elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that resemble a vessel or urn, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. Its stems are flexible and can elongate significantly, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly.</p>
<p>The rubber vine is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
