<p>Ulmus minor subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
