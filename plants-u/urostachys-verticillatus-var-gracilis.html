                    <h1>Urostachys verticillatus var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Urostachys verticillatus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender clustered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
