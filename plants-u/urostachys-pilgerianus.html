                    <h1>Urostachys pilgerianus</h1>
<p>Urostachys pilgerianus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, gray-green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access water from deeper layers.</p>
<p>Urostachys pilgerianus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
