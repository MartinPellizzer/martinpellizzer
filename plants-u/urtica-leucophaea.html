<p>Urtica leucophaea, commonly known as the white stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on both the stems and leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Urtica leucophaea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
