                    <h1>Utricularia inflexa</h1>
<p>Utricularia inflexa, commonly known as the flexed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Utricularia inflexa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
