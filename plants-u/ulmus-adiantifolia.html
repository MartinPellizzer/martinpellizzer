<p>It is native to eastern North America, particularly the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The tree is characterized by its slender, weeping form and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a finely toothed margin, often resembling the fronds of a fern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
