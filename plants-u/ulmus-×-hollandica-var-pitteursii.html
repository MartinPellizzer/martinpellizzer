<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. pitteursii, commonly known as the Weeping Wych Elm, is a hybrid elm species characterized by its distinctive weeping habit.</p>
<p>It features long, cascading branches that create a drooping canopy, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
