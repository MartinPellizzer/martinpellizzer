                    <h1>Utricularia ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Utricularia ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement and are highly efficient in nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Utricularia ceratophylla is native to regions in Africa and is often found in marshy or pond habitats.</p>
