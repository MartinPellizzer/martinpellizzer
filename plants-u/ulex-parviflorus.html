                <h1>Ulex parviflorus</h1>
<p>Ulex parviflorus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and woody, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and harsh conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
