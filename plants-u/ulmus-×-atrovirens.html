                    <h1>Ulmus × atrovirens</h1>
<p>Ulmus × atrovirens, commonly known as the black elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus glabra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length. The tree grows to a height of 15–25 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is moderately tolerant of urban conditions, making it a suitable candidate for street tree planting.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
