                    <h1>Urnularia</h1>
<p>Urnularia, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Umbilicaraceae and is known for its distinctive cup-like or urn-shaped thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Urnularia species are often found on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological role make it an important subject in lichenology and ecological studies.</p>
