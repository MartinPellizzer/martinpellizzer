<p>Utricularia anthropophora, commonly known as the human-faced bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its trapping mechanism for essential nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters above the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia anthropophora is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to aquatic environments.</p>
