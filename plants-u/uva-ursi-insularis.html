                    <h1>Uva-ursi insularis</h1>
<p>Uva-ursi insularis, commonly known as the island bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to specific island regions in the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species.</p>
