                    <h1>Umbilicus lampusae</h1>
<p>Umbilicus lampusae, commonly known as the moonlight umbel, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its unique phototropic properties allow it to open its flowers in response to moonlight, making it a subject of fascination for botanists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
