<p>Utricularia hirta, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear tiny bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Utricularia hirta is an epiphytic or aquatic plant, often growing on submerged vegetation or floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Its hairy appearance is due to the fine, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves.</p>
