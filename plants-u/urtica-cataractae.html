                    <h1>Urtica cataractae</h1>
<p>Urtica cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall nettle, is a unique species of stinging nettle found primarily in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urtica genus. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritants, are a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Urtica cataractae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near waterfalls or in rocky crevices.</p>
