                    <h1>Ulmus rosseelsii</h1>
<p>Ulmus rosseelsii, commonly known as the Rosseels' elm, is a rare and critically endangered species of elm native to Belgium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a short, stout petiole. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in a few isolated locations in the region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and disease.</p>
