                    <h1>Uva-ursi obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Uva-ursi obtusifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Uva-ursi obtusifolia is well adapted to harsh, rocky, and acidic soils, often found in alpine and boreal environments.</p>
<p>It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential urinary tract health benefits.</p>
