                    <h1>Ulmus suberosa pendula-lombartsii</h1>
<p>Ulmus suberosa pendula-lombartsii, commonly known as the Lombardian weeping elm, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its weeping habit and cascading branches.</p>
<p>It belongs to the elm family, Ulmaceae, and is native to the mountainous regions of the Dolomites in Italy. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
