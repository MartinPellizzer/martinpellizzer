<p>Urostigma protensum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in its native habitat.</p>
