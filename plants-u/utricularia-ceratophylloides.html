                    <h1>Utricularia ceratophylloides</h1>
<p>Utricularia ceratophylloides, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot acquire from the water alone.</p>
<p>Utricularia ceratophylloides is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy or pond environments.</p>
