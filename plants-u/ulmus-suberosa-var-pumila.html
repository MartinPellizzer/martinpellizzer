                    <h1>Ulmus suberosa var. pumila</h1>
<p>Ulmus suberosa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf warty elm, is a small, slow-growing tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and rough, warty bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough texture and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is less common in cultivation due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements.</p>
