                    <h1>Urostigma lachnocaulon</h1>
<p>Urostigma lachnocaulon, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and its unique ability to trap small aquatic organisms, although it is not a true carnivorous plant. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often submerged, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant's name reflects its sticky secretions and its association with bladder-like structures.</p>
