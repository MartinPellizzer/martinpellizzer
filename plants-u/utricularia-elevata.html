                    <h1>Utricularia elevata</h1>
<p>Utricularia elevata, commonly known as the aerial bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to grow in wet soil or waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for tiny aquatic organisms. These utricles are typically found on the stems and leaves, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients through carnivory.</p>
<p>Utricularia elevata is often found in marshes, ponds, and other moist habitats where it can thrive without soil.</p>
