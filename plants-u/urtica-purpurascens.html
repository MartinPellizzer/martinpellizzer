                    <h1>Urtica purpurascens</h1>
<p>Urtica purpurascens, commonly known as the red stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential allergen for those sensitive to urticating hairs.</p>
