<p>Urtica dioica var. diplotricha is a lesser-known variant of the common nettle, known for its unique growth patterns and ecological significance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and stinging hairs make it both a defensive mechanism and a challenge for foragers. Despite its reputation, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and soil health. Understanding this plant offers insights into the adaptability of native flora in diverse ecosystems.</p>
