                    <h1>Utricularia cheiranthos</h1>
<p>Utricularia cheiranthos, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, water-filled bladders that function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and floating, while the stems are often branched and submerged.</p>
<p>Utricularia cheiranthos plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
