                    <h1>Uragoga lucida</h1>
<p>Uragoga lucida, commonly known as the luminous orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom during the evening hours. Its root system is fibrous and highly sensitive to changes in soil moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga lucida is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
