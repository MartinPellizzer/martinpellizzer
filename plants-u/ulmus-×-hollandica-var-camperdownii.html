                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica var. camperdownii</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. camperdownii, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a hybrid species of the elm tree native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its weeping growth habit and slender, drooping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The leaves are typically small, elongated, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
