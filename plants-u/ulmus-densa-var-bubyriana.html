                    <h1>Ulmus densa var. bubyriana</h1>
<p>Ulmus densa var. bubyriana, commonly known as the Bubyriana elm, is a rare and ancient variety of elm native to central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European botany.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is now rare in the wild.</p>
