                    <h1>Uragoga calliantha</h1>
<p>Uragoga calliantha, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Uragoga calliantha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species despite its toxic properties.</p>
