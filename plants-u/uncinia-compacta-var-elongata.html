                    <h1>Uncinia compacta var. elongata</h1>
<p>Uncinia compacta var. elongata, commonly known as the slender hookweed, is a variant of the hookweed species native to certain regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short, hairy stalks. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in wetland areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
