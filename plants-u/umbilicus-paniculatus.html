                    <h1>Umbilicus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus paniculatus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in a paniculate inflorescence.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor water ecosystems by supplementing its own nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
