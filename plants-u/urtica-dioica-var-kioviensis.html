                    <h1>Urtica dioica var. kioviensis</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica var. kioviensis, commonly known as the Kioviensis stinging nettle, is a variant of the common nettle found primarily in specific regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fine, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in traditional medicine.</p>
