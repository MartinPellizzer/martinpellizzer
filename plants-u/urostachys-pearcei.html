                    <h1>Urostachys pearcei</h1>
<p>Urostachys pearcei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Urostachys pearcei plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
