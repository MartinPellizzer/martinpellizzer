                    <h1>Ulmus davidiana f. suberosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus davidiana f. suberosa, commonly known as the Chinese cliff elm, is a unique variant of the David's elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and thick, flaky bark, which gives it a rugged appearance. This form is typically found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The leaves are small, oval, and have a slightly serrated edge, often turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing tree that is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
