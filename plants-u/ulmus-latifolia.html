                    <h1>Ulmus latifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 4â€“8 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age.</p>
<p>Ulmus latifolia is valued for its fast growth and shade-providing canopy, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
