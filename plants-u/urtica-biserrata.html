<p>Urtica biserrata, commonly known as the serrated nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction in humans. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Urtica biserrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
