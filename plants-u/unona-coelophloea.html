<p>Unona coelophloea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, and its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
