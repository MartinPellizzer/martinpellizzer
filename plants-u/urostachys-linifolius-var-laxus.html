<p>Urostachys linifolius var. laxus, commonly known as the loose-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
