                    <h1>Utricularia fluitans</h1>
<p>Utricularia fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, allowing it to float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of tiny invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
