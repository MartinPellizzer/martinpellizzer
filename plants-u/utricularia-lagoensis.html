                    <h1>Utricularia lagoensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia lagoensis, commonly known as the lake bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces delicate, floating leaves that help it remain buoyant.</p>
<p>Utricularia lagoensis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
