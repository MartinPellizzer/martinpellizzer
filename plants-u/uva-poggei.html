                <h1>Uva poggei</h1>
<p>Uva poggei, commonly known as the Italian grape, is a lesser-known species within the Vitis genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, and is characterized by its small, dark berries. The plant typically grows as a vine, producing tendrils that help it climb and spread. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it flowers in the spring before the fruit develops.</p>
<p>Uva poggei is valued for its unique flavor profile and is sometimes used in local winemaking traditions.</p>
