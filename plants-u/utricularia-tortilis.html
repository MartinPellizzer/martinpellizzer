                    <h1>Utricularia tortilis</h1>
<p>Utricularia tortilis, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant's aerial stems often form dense mats on the water surface, while its roots anchor it in submerged substrates. Utricularia tortilis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
