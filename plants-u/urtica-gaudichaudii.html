<p>Urtica gaudichaudii, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, and its root system is fibrous and extensive.</p>
<p>Urtica gaudichaudii is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its historical use by MƒÅori for medicinal purposes.</p>
