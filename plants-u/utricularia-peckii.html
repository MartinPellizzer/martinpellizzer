<p>Utricularia peckii, commonly known as the Peck's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing microorganisms to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Utricularia peckii is native to parts of Asia and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
