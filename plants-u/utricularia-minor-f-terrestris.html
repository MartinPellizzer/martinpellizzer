                    <h1>Utricularia minor f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Utricularia minor f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant that exhibits both submerged and terrestrial growth habits.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typical of the genus Utricularia. This particular form is adapted to grow in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies. Its leaves are typically narrow and floating, while its roots anchor it in the substrate.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
