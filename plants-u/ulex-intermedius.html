<p>Ulex intermedius, commonly known as the common bladder campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features upright, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bladder-like seed pods that burst to disperse seeds.

<p>Ulex intermedius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas.</p>
