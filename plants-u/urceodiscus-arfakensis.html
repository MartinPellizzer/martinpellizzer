                    <h1>Urceodiscus arfakensis</h1>
<p>Urceodiscus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis urn-leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Central America. Its foliage exhibits a striking contrast between the deep green upper surface and the lighter, often silver-tinged underside. The flowers are typically small, tubular, and come in shades of pink or white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
