<p>Uraria cercifolia, commonly known as the Indian velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
