<p>Utleria salicifolia, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Utleria salicifolia thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
