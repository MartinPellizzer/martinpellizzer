<p>Utricularia hispida, commonly known as the hispid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, ponds, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia hispida is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to diverse aquatic habitats.</p>
