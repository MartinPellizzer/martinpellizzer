                    <h1>Uragoga hookeri</h1>
<p>Uragoga hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's urara, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araliaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and often milky sap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in dense forest understories. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga hookeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
