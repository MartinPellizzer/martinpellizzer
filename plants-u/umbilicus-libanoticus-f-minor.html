<p>Umbilicus libanoticus f. minor, commonly known as the lesser sacred umbilicus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to its parent species, Umbilicus libanoticus. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, spicy scent, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
