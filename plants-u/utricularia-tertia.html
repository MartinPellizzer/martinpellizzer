                    <h1>Utricularia tertia</h1>
<p>Utricularia tertia, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a carnivorous aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia tertia is often found in nutrient-poor habitats, where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
