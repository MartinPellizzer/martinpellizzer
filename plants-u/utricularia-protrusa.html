                    <h1>Utricularia protrusa</h1>
<p>Utricularia protrusa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, enabling it to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. This species is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while the stems are highly branched and can float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia protrusa is a delicate plant that thrives in moist, sunny conditions and is often used in botanical studies to understand carnivorous plant adaptations.</p>
