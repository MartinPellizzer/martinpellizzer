<p>Utricularia spirandra, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged stems and tiny bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia spirandra is native to parts of Africa and is often found in shaded, nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
