                    <h1>Uroskinnera hirtiflora var. breviloba</h1>
<p>Uroskinnera hirtiflora var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-stalked hirtiflora, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral morphology.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environment. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a short peduncle, giving it its specific variety name "breviloba.". It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils and dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
