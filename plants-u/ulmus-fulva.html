                    <h1>Ulmus fulva</h1>
<p>Ulmus fulva, commonly known as the American slippery elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, mucilaginous substance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests.</p>
<p>The plant has been historically used for its medicinal properties, particularly the mucilage from its inner bark.</p>
