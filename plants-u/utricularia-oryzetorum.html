                    <h1>Utricularia oryzetorum</h1>
<p>Utricularia oryzetorum, commonly known as the ricefield bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and rice fields in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, with its roots submerged and its leaves floating on the surface. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or green, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.</p>
<p>Utricularia oryzetorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
