<p>Urostachys dichaeoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Urostachys dichaeoides plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
