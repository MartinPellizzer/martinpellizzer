<p>Utricularia oliveriana f. parva, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically less than 1 mm in size. This epiphytic or submerged plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually filamentous or branched, and it lacks true roots, relying on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to proliferate in disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
