                    <h1>Utricularia vulgaris var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Utricularia vulgaris var. neglecta, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective colonizer of open water environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it plays a role in controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life.</p>
