<p>Utricularia ostenii, commonly known as the Cape Verde bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, with the bladders attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Utricularia ostenii is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for nutrient acquisition.</p>
