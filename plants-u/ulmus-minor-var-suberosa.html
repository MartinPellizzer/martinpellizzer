                    <h1>Ulmus minor var. suberosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus minor var. suberosa, commonly known as the rock elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, often fissured bark that becomes flaky with age. The tree typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in cooler, elevated environments. Its compact size and hardy nature make it well-suited for urban landscapes and small gardens.</p>
<p>The rock elm is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal.</p>
