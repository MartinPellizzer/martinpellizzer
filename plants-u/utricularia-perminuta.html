                    <h1>Utricularia perminuta</h1>
<p>Utricularia perminuta, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey, which provide it with essential nutrients. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often reduced to slender, thread-like structures, while the bladders are microscopic and clustered along the stems.</p>
<p>Utricularia perminuta is an epiphytic plant, meaning it can attach itself to other plants or surfaces in its habitat.</p>
