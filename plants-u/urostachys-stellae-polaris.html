<p>Urostachys stellae-polaris, commonly known as the polar star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Urostachys stellae-polaris is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in polar ecosystems.</p>
