                    <h1>Unamia × lutescens</h1>
<p>Unamia × lutescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine bellflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Unamia × lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat.</p>
