                    <h1>Unifolium</h1>
<p>Unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaf grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its simple, grass-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically features a single, narrow leaf blade that arises from a short, underground stem called a rhizome. The plant is often found in moist, temperate environments, such as wetlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually long and slender, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Unifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
