                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. camperdowni</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. camperdowni, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a cultivar of the Wych elm, native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree with a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a distinctive double-toothed margin and a bluish-green underside. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in urban landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in the wild.</p>
