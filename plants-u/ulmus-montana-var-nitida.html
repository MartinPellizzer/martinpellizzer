                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. nitida</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. nitida, commonly known as the narrowleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
