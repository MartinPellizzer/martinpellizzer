<p>Utricularia filicaulis var. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant features delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are small and often white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by the presence of fine, hairy structures on its stems and leaves, giving it its common name.</p>
