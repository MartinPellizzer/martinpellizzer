<p>Urtica membranacea subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The subspecies is often confused with other nettle species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences.</p>
