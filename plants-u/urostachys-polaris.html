<p>Urostachys polaris, commonly known as the polar leek, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike-like structure during the short growing season. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Urostachys polaris plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
