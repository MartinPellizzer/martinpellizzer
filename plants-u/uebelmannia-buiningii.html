<p>Uebelmannia buiningii, commonly known as the Buning's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant features a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
