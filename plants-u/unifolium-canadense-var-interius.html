<p>Unifolium canadense var. interius, commonly known as the Canadian one-leaf plant, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its singular, palmately lobed leaf that emerges directly from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
