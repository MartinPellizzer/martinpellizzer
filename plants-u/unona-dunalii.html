                    <h1>Unona dunalii</h1>
<p>Unona dunalii, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a hardy plant adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its root system is extensive, anchoring it firmly in loose sand and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Unona dunalii plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal ecosystems.</p>
