<p>Utricularia verapazensis, commonly known as the Verapaz bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-poor water environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia verapazensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
