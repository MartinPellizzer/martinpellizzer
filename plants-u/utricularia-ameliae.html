                    <h1>Utricularia ameliae</h1>
<p>Utricularia ameliae, commonly known as Amelia's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Utricularia ameliae is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
