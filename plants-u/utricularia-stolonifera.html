                    <h1>Utricularia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Utricularia stolonifera, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it forms dense mats on the surface. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly through runners that produce new plants.</p>
<p>Botanically, it has slender, branched stems with opposite leaves and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
