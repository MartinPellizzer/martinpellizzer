                    <h1>Utricularia verticillata</h1>
<p>Utricularia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Utricularia verticillata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
