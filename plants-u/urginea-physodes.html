<p>Urginea physodes, commonly known as the giant bulbous lily, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat, which bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, elongated, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid environment. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea physodes is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
