                <h1>Ulmus hollandica</h1>
<p>Ulmus hollandica, commonly known as the Dutch elm, is a species of elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often lobed and have a silvery-white underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is now rare in the wild.</p>
