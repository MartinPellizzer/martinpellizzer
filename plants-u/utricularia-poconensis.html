<p>Utricularia poconensis, commonly known as the Pocon√© waterwheel, is a carnivorous plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies and has delicate, floating leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in a whorled pattern.</p>
<p>Utricularia poconensis plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
