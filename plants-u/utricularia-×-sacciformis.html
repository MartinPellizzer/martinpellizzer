                    <h1>Utricularia × sacciformis</h1>
<p>Utricularia × sacciformis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia aurea and Utricularia inflata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its specialized bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes slender stems and small, floating leaves, with the bladders typically located along the stem nodes.</p>
