<p>Unciferia psilantha, commonly known as the slender sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Unciferia psilantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
