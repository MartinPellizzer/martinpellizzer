                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia-pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia-pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit.</p>
<p>It features long, cascading branches that create a graceful, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aesthetic qualities but is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease, making it a challenging plant to maintain in certain environments.</p>
