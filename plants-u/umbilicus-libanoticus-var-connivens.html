                    <h1>Umbilicus libanoticus var. connivens</h1>
<p>Umbilicus libanoticus var. connivens, commonly known as the Lebanese bellybutton plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbilicated or button-like structure at the base of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate precipitation. Its foliage is usually evergreen, with small, rounded leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
