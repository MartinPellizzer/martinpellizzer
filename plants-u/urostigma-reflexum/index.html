                            <h1>Urostigma Reflexum</h1>
<p>Urostigma reflexum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its small, pale yellow flowers and distinctive reflexed petals that curl backward. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
