                    <h1>Uragoga psychotrioides</h1>
<p>Uragoga psychotrioides, commonly known as the sacred yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, red berries that are toxic to most animals but have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of its ecosystem. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
<p>However, habitat destruction and overharvesting have led to a significant decline in its population.</p>
