<p>Ulmus scabra subf.</p>
<p>macrophylla, commonly known as the giant warty elm, is a variant of the warty elm native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, warty bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and lowland areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
