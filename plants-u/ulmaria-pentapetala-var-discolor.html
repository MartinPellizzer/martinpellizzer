<p>Ulmaria pentapetala var. discolor, commonly known as white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish or grayish coating. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling and use.</p>
