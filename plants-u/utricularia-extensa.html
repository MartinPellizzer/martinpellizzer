                    <h1>Utricularia extensa</h1>
<p>Utricularia extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, succulent leaves and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are sensitive to water movement and can expel water rapidly to create a vacuum that sucks in small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia extensa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
