<p>Unamia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Unamia fastigiata prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
