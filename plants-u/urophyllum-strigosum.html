<p>Urophyllum strigosum, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Urophyllum strigosum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
