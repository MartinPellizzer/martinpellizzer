                    <h1>Urochloa semiundulata</h1>
<p>Urochloa semiundulata, commonly known as the wavy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, slightly undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Urochloa semiundulata is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
