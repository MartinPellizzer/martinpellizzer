                    <h1>Urostachys orizabae</h1>
<p>Urostachys orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that form dense clumps and produce delicate, feathery inflorescences during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its fine, silver-gray foliage and light, airy flower plumes.</p>
<p>Urostachys orizabae is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
