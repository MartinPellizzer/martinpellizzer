                    <h1>Ulmus glabra subvar. dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra subvar. dasycarpa, commonly known as the smooth field elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, clustered fruits.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, typically reaching heights of 15 to 25 meters. The leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and the tree produces small, round samaras that are clustered in groups of three. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other elms but is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and historical botany.</p>
