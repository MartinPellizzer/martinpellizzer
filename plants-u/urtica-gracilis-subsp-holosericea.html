<p>Urtica gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>holosericea, commonly known as the silky stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
