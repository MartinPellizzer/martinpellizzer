<p>Utricularia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap prey such as small aquatic invertebrates. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats, including ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.
