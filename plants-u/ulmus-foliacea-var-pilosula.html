<p>Ulmus foliacea var. pilosula, commonly known as the silky elm, is a variant of the weeping elm native to parts of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and the soft, feathery texture of its foliage.</p>
