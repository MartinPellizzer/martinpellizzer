<p>Upuna, commonly known as the "tree of life" in some indigenous cultures, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a small, spiky gourd, which contains edible seeds. Upuna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Cynanchum debile*, reflects its classification within the Asclepiadaceae family.</p>
