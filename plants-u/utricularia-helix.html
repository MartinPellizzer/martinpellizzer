                    <h1>Utricularia helix</h1>
<p>Utricularia helix, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped leaves and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and white or yellow, arranged in a raceme.</p>
<p>Utricularia helix relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
