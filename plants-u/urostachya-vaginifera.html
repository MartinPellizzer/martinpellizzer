                    <h1>Urostachya vaginifera</h1>
<p>Urostachya vaginifera, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Urostachya vaginifera is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
