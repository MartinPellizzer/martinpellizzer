                            <h1>Urtica Dioica Subsp. Gracilis</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender nettle, is a lesser-known variant of the common stinging nettle. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Unlike its more aggressive relatives, it has a more delicate appearance with smaller leaves and less intense stinging hairs. It is often overlooked due to its subtle features but holds ecological and medicinal significance. Its unique characteristics make it an intriguing subject for botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
