<p>Urtica arborea, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched, causing a stinging sensation.</p>
<p>Urtica arborea thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
