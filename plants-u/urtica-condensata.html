<p>Urtica condensata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, irritating hairs that release histamine and other chemicals upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are hollow and often have a similar stinging effect. Urtica condensata thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
