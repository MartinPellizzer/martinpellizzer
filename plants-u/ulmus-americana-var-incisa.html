                    <h1>Ulmus americana var. incisa</h1>
<p>Ulmus americana var. incisa, commonly known as the American elm variant with incised leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that have distinctive incisions, giving it a unique appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters, with a tall, slender trunk and a spreading, vase-like crown. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the standard American elm due to its limited range and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease.</p>
