                    <h1>Urtica muricata</h1>
<p>Urtica muricata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves, which contain irritant chemicals called urticating hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica muricata is often found in forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a plant with historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
