                    <h1>Urbinella palmeri</h1>
<p>Urbinella palmeri, commonly known as the desert star or desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Urbinella palmeri is well-suited to xeriscaping and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
