<p>Urostigma xanthophyllum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are consumed by birds. It is native to parts of Africa and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
