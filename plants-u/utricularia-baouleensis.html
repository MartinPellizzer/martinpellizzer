                    <h1>Utricularia baouleensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia baouleensis, commonly known as the Baoule Bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate structure.</p>
<p>Utricularia baouleensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
