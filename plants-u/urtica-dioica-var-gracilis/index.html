<p>Urtica dioica var. gracilis is a lesser-known variant of the common stinging nettle known for its delicate, slender stems and reduced stinging hairs. Found primarily in moist, shaded environments, this plant thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks. While it shares the characteristic stinging properties of its parent species, it is often less aggressive and more manageable for cultivation. Its unique appearance and medicinal potential have sparked interest among botanists and herbalists alike. This article explores the biology, habitat, and uses of this intriguing plant.</p>
