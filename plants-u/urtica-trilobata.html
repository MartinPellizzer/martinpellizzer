<p>Urtica trilobata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica trilobata is also valued for its edible leaves, which can be cooked to remove the stinging properties.</p>
