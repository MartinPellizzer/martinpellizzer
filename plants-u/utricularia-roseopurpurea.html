<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, inflated bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
