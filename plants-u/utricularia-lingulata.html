<p>Utricularia lingulata, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are typically submerged, while its stems and leaves float at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia lingulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
