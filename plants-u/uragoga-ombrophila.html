<p>Uragoga ombrophila, commonly known as the Brazilian rainforest fern, is a species native to the dense tropical forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that thrive in high humidity and shade. The plant typically grows along the forest floor, where it benefits from the consistent moisture and rich organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Uragoga ombrophila plays a vital role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
