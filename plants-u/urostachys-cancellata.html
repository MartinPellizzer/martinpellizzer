<p>Urostachys cancellata, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are characterized by a distinctive pattern of raised, waxy dots that give it a speckled appearance.</p>
<p>Urostachys cancellata is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
