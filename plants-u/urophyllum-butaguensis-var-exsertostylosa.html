                    <h1>Urophyllum butaguensis var. exsertostylosa</h1>
<p>Urophyllum butaguensis var. exsertostylosa, commonly known as the exsertostylosa variant of the genus Urophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring elongated, exserted stamens that extend beyond the corolla. This botanical trait is an adaptation that may enhance pollination efficiency by attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often within tropical or subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and distinctive features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
