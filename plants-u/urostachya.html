                    <h1>Urostachya</h1>
<p>Urostachya, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where they thrive in dry, sandy soils. Urostachya species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with spikelets that give the plant its common name.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
