                    <h1>Urechites pinetorum</h1>
<p>Urechites pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. The thallus is typically grayish-green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, lobed appearance. It is often found on the bark of pine trees, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision for microorganisms.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and forest health.</p>
