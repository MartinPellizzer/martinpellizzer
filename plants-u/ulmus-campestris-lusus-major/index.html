<p>Ulmus campestris lusus major is a lesser-known species of elm native to parts of central and eastern europe. it is often confused with the common field elm due to its similar appearance. this plant thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. it is known for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. despite its hardiness, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
