                    <h1>Uragoga fraterna</h1>
<p>Uragoga fraterna, commonly known as the brother's root, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, fibrous root system that is highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming season occurs during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Uragoga fraterna is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
