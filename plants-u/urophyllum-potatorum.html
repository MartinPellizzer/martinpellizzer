<p>Urophyllum potatorum, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>Urophyllum potatorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
