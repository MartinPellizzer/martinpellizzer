<p>Uragoga thollonii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy floral structures that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga thollonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
