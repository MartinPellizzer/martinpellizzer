                    <h1>Ulmus × sylvatica</h1>
<p>Ulmus × sylvatica, commonly known as the American elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European elm (U. europaea) and the Chinese elm (U. parvifolia).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, vase-shaped crown, with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated. The tree produces small, winged samaras that disperse its seeds, aiding in its natural propagation. It is native to the eastern United States and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in the wild.</p>
