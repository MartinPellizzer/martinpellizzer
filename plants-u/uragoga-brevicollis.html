<p>Uragoga brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and branched, with small, scale-like structures at the base.</p>
<p>Uragoga brevicollis is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival.</p>
