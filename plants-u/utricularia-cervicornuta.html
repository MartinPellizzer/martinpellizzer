                    <h1>Utricularia cervicornuta</h1>
<p>Utricularia cervicornuta, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey, which are typically tiny aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in wet environments such as marshes and ponds, where it can float or grow submerged.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and predatory mechanism make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
