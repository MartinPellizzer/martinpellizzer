<p>Unona concinna, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Unona concinna is often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples for its purported healing properties.</p>
