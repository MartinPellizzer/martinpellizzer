<p>Urtica semicrenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. The plant has heart-shaped or oval leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica semicrenata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
