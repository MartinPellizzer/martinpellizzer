                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. dampieri</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. dampieri, commonly known as the Dampier's elm, is a rare and ancient variant of the mountain elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow in autumn. This variety is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes exceeding two centuries.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range.</p>
