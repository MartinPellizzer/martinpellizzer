                    <h1>Urtica dioica var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica var. gracilis, commonly known as slender nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely toothed leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive mechanisms, it is valued in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked.</p>
