                    <h1>Ulmus × alta</h1>
<p>Ulmus × alta, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of various elm species.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a rounded or irregular crown with a trunk that is often straight and slightly fluted. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions.</p>
