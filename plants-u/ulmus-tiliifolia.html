                    <h1>Ulmus tiliifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus tiliifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other elm species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Ulmus tiliifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
