                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. monumentalis</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. monumentalis, commonly known as the Field Elm cultivar 'Monumental', is a variant of the Field Elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow crown and smooth, gray bark that develops deep fissures with age. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. This cultivar is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of urban conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
