                    <h1>Utricularia livida var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Utricularia livida var. pauciflora, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>It is a relatively rare variant within the Utricularia genus, distinguished by its reduced flower count compared to other species.</p>
