<p>Urostigma rufum, commonly known as the red-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urostigma rufum is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
