<p>Uncinia compacta var. clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's compact uncinia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
