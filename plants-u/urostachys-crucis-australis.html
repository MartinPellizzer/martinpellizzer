<p>Urostachys crucis-australis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted clusters of fine, silver-blue foliage that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in extreme climates with minimal soil and moisture.</p>
