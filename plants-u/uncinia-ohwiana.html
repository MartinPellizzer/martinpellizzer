<p>Uncinia ohwiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf hookweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by hooked, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
