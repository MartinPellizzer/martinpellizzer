<p>Urtica iners, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hair-like structures called trichomes, which release irritating chemicals when touched, causing a painful rash. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica iners is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices.</p>
