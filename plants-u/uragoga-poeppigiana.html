<p>Uragoga poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert star or desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall. The plant features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and its stems are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Uragoga poeppigiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
