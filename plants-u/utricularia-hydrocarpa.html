                    <h1>Utricularia hydrocarpa</h1>
<p>Utricularia hydrocarpa, commonly known as the water whorlwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features whorled leaves and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with a vacuum and are triggered by the movement of small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia hydrocarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of microinvertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
