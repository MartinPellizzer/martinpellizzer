                    <h1>Uragoga detoniana</h1>
<p>Uragoga detoniana, commonly known as the explosive orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, explosive capsules, which open with a sudden burst to release seeds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
