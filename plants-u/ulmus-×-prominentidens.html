                    <h1>Ulmus × prominentidens</h1>
<p>Ulmus × prominentidens, commonly known as the Chinese field elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and shade tree in parts of Asia.</p>
