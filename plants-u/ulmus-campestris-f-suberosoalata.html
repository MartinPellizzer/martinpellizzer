                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. suberosoalata</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. suberosoalata, commonly known as the silver-leaf field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive silvery-white bark.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree exhibits a broad, spreading canopy with heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard field elm. The bark develops a rugged, flaky texture as the tree matures, contributing to its unique appearance. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
