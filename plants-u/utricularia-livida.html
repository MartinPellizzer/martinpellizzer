<p>Utricularia livida, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture tiny aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia livida is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds, marshes, and wetlands.</p>
