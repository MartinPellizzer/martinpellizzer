                    <h1>Urginea zambesiaca</h1>
<p>Urginea zambesiaca, commonly known as the Zambesi arrowhead, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a large, ovoid bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Urginea zambesiaca is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
