                    <h1>Urtica echinata var. punctulata</h1>
<p>Urtica echinata var. punctulata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, green stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant contains a mixture of formic acid and other irritants in its trichomes, which cause a painful reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Urtica echinata var. punctulata is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use requires caution due to its defensive mechanisms.</p>
