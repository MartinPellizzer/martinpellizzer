                    <h1>Utricularia exilis var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Utricularia exilis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in shallow water bodies with muddy substrates. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like traps that capture microscopic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are typically slender and branched, with specialized structures for trapping prey.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy appearance, which may aid in reducing water loss and providing structural support in its wetland environment.</p>
