                    <h1>Utricularia puberula</h1>
<p>Utricularia puberula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for small aquatic organisms. These utricles are covered with fine, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia puberula is often found in nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey.</p>
