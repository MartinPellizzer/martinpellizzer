<p>Utricularia prehensilis var. hians, commonly known as the aquatic bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, translucent bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can anchor itself with its specialized root-like structures. Its leaves are slender and often form dense clusters, enhancing its ability to capture prey.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its carnivorous behavior.</p>
