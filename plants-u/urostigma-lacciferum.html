                    <h1>Urostigma lacciferum</h1>
<p>Urostigma lacciferum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Urostigma lacciferum is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and decorative crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
