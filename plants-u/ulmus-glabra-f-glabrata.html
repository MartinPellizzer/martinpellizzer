                    <h1>Ulmus glabra f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elm, is a cultivar of the American elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. This variety is often valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to other elms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is still susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival in the wild.</p>
