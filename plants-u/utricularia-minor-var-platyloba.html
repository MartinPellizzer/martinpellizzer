                    <h1>Utricularia minor var. platyloba</h1>
<p>Utricularia minor var. platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, usually unbranched stems and small, rounded leaves that often form a rosette at the base. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it is known for its specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>This species is an example of a carnivorous plant that uses both photosynthesis and predation to obtain nutrients.</p>
