<p>Utricularia charoidea, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it can float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia charoidea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
