                    <h1>Uragoga platypoda</h1>
<p>Uragoga platypoda, commonly known as the flat-footed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a broad, flattened lip that distinguishes it from other orchid genera. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga platypoda is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical rarity.</p>
