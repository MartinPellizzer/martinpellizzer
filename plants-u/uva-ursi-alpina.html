                    <h1>Uva-ursi alpina</h1>
<p>Uva-ursi alpina, commonly known as alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it retain heat in cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Uva-ursi alpina thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky or barren environments.</p>
