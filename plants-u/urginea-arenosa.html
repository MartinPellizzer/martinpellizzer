<p>Urginea arenosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Urginea arenosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
