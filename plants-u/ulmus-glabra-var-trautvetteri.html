                    <h1>Ulmus glabra var. trautvetteri</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra var. trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's elm, is a variant of the Wych elm native to central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and long, drooping branches. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface and a distinct yellow-green underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in the wild.</p>
