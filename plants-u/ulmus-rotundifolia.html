<p>Ulmus rotundifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other elm species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Ulmus rotundifolia is relatively resistant to Dutch elm disease compared to other elm species.</p>
