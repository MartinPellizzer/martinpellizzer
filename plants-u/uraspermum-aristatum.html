<p>Uraspermum aristatum, commonly known as the arrowhead bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive arrowhead shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Uraspermum aristatum is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients.</p>
