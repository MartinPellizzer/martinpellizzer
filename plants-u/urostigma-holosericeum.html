<p>Urostigma holosericeum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
