                    <h1>Urostachys cassandrae</h1>
<p>Urostachys cassandrae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Urostachys cassandrae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>
