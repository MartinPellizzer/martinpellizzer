                    <h1>Utricularia australis f. fixa</h1>
<p>Utricularia australis f. fixa, commonly known as the fixed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself with its roots. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured aquatic organisms.</p>
