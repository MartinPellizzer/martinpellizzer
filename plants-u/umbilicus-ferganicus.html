                    <h1>Umbilicus ferganicus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus ferganicus, commonly known as the spiral heartleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which follow a logarithmic pattern reminiscent of the Fibonacci sequence. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this botanically intriguing species.</p>
