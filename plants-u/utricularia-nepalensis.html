                    <h1>Utricularia nepalensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically whorled and have specialized structures for attachment to substrates.</p>
<p>Utricularia nepalensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation.</p>
