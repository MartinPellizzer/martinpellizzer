                    <h1>Ulex gallii</h1>
<p>Ulex gallii, commonly known as the sheep's bean or bladder campion, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, calcareous soils. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which are a key feature in its common name. Its flowers are small, purple, and pea-like, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Ulex gallii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
