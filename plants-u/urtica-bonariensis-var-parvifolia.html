                    <h1>Urtica bonariensis var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica bonariensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
