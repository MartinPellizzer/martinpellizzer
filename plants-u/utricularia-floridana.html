                    <h1>Utricularia floridana</h1>
<p>Utricularia floridana, commonly known as the Florida bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Florida.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant with delicate, floating leaves that contain tiny bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
