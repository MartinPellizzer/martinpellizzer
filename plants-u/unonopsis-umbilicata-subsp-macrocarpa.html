<p>Unonopsis umbilicata subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants or substrates rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that contribute to its specialized trapping mechanism.</p>
