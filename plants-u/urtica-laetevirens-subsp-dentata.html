<p>Urtica laetevirens subsp.</p>
<p>dentata, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which are covered in fine stinging hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
