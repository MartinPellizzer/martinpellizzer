                    <h1>Urochondra setulosa</h1>
<p>Urochondra setulosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant's stems are often submerged, and its leaves are typically short and branched. Urochondra setulosa thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its diet.</p>
<p>Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
