<p>Urera bequaertii, commonly known as the Guianan urera, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range.</p>
