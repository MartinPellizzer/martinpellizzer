<p>Utricularia ramosa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it floats on the surface or is anchored to substrates. Its stems are often branched and can form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia ramosa is a rapid-growing species that thrives in warm, sunny conditions with ample water movement.</p>
