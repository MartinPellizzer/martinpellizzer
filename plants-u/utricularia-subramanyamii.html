<p>Utricularia subramanyamii, commonly known as the Ramana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing microorganisms for nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinct sepals and petals.</p>
<p>Utricularia subramanyamii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling bacterial populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
