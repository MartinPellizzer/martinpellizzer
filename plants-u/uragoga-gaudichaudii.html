The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and革质, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
