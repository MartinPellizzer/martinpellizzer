                    <h1>Urostachys reflexus var. schaffneri</h1>
<p>Urostachys reflexus var. schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's reflexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its reflexed (bent backward) leaf tips, which distinguish it from other sedge species.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
