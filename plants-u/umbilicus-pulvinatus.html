<p>Umbilicus pulvinatus, commonly known as the cushion umbilicaria, is a type of lichen belonging to the family Umbilicariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cushion-like growth form and a dark, almost black, thallus that often has a central umbilical depression. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a dense, leaf-like layer called the cortex, with a central cavity that gives it its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Umbilicus pulvinatus is a slow-growing species that plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
