                    <h1>Utricularia heterosepala</h1>
<p>Utricularia heterosepala, commonly known as the broad-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that function as traps to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually broad and floating, while its roots are often submerged.</p>
<p>Utricularia heterosepala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
