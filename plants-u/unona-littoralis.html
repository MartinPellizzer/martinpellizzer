                    <h1>Unona littoralis</h1>
<p>Unona littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, star-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Unona littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
