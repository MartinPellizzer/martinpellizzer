                    <h1>Ulmus microphylla var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus microphylla var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a striking tree characterized by its pendulous branches that cascade like a weeping willow.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The tree has small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental appeal. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it requires careful management to ensure its survival.</p>
