                    <h1>Urochloa pubescens</h1>
<p>Urochloa pubescens, commonly known as hairy buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a fibrous structure, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in erosion control and forage production.</p>
<p>Urochloa pubescens is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun and withstand drought conditions.</p>
