<p>Urtica umbrosa, commonly known as the shade nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Urtica umbrosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
