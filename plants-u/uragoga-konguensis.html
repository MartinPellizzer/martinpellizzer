<p>Uragoga konguensis, commonly known as the Kongu mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the monsoon season, typically between June and September. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
