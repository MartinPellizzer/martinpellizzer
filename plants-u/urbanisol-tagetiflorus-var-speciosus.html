                    <h1>Urbanisol tagetiflorus var. speciosus</h1>
<p>Urbanisol tagetiflorus var. speciosus, commonly known as the showy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh urban and rural environments.</p>
