<p>Utricularia scandens, commonly known as the aquatic bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, delicate flowers that emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia scandens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
