<p>Uittienia modesta, commonly known as the modest spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its stems are often hairy and can branch out to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Uittienia modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
