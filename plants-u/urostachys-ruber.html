                    <h1>Urostachys ruber</h1>
<p>Urostachys ruber, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pink, or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Urostachys ruber is often found in desert scrub, gravelly slopes, and along riverbanks where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
