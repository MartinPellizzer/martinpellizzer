<p>Urtica gracilis f. densa, commonly known as the dense stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its densely packed leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating substance when touched, causing a stinging sensation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in nutrient-rich soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
