                    <h1>Ulmus × curvifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus × curvifolia, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) and the American elm (Ulmus americana).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rapid growth, shallow root system, and moderate drought tolerance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5–9 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ulmus × curvifolia is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and resistance to certain diseases.</p>
