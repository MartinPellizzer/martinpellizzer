                    <h1>Urbanisol decurrens</h1>
<p>Urbanisol decurrens, commonly known as the cityscape grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along sidewalks, in cracks of pavement, and in other urban microhabitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to colonize urban areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion in built environments.</p>
