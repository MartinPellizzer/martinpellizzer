<p>Utricularia cyanea var. alba, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in water or very moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this species make it an interesting subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations.</p>
