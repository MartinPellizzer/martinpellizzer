                    <h1>Uncaria peltata</h1>
<p>Uncaria peltata, commonly known as the prickly ash or Indian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
