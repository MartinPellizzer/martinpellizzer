                    <h1>Utricularia andongensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia andongensis, commonly known as the Andong bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
