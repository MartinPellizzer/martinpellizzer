<p>Urgineopsis salteri, commonly known as Salter's urge, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urgineopsis salteri is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
