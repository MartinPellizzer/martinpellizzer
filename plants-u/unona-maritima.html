<p>Unona maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower cluster. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its unique structure helps it retain moisture and resist salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.</p>
