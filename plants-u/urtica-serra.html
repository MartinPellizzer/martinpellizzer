                    <h1>Urtica serra</h1>
<p>Urtica serra, commonly known as the serrated nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which often cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica serra is known for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, making it both a defensive mechanism and a notable feature of its botanical profile.</p>
