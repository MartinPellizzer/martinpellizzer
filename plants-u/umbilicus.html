                    <h1>Umbilicus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus, commonly known as the navel, is not a plant but a anatomical feature in humans and some animals.</p>
<p>However, the term "umbilicus" is also used in botany to refer to the central part of certain plants, such as the umbilical scar on the seed of a coconut. In some species, this area may serve as a site for nutrient absorption or structural support. It is often found in the mature stage of the plant's life cycle.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of the umbilicus varies depending on the species and its developmental stage.</p>
