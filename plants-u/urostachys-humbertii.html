                    <h1>Urostachys humbertii</h1>
<p>Urostachys humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's feathergrass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
