                    <h1>Utricularia sandersonii var. treubii</h1>
<p>Utricularia sandersonii var. treubii, commonly known as the sanderson's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies and thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a short flowering period.</p>
<p>The varietal form treubii is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical sandersonii.</p>
