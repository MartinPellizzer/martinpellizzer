<p>Unedo, commonly known as medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It produces unique, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to soften and ferment after picking. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with dark green, lobed leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit has a complex flavor, often described as a mix of apple, fig, and pear, with a slight tartness.</p>
<p>Unedo is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has a long history of cultivation in European gardens.</p>
