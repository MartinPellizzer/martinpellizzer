                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. rugosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rugose bark that gives it its common name and its heart-shaped, doubly serrated leaves. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
