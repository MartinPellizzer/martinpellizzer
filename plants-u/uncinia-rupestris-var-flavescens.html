                    <h1>Uncinia rupestris var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Uncinia rupestris var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
