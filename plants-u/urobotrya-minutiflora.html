                    <h1>Urobotrya minutiflora</h1>
<p>Urobotrya minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to bluish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
