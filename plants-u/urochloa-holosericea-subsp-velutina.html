<p>Urochloa holosericea subsp.</p>
<p>velutina, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.

<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
