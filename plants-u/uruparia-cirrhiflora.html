                    <h1>Uruparia cirrhiflora</h1>
<p>Uruparia cirrhiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils.</p>
<p>Uruparia cirrhiflora is often found in dry forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
