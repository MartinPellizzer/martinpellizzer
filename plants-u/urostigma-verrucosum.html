                    <h1>Urostigma verrucosum</h1>
<p>Urostigma verrucosum, commonly known as the warty bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by inflated, seed-filled pods that resemble bladders. Its root system is adapted for deep water absorption, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Urostigma verrucosum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry fields.</p>
