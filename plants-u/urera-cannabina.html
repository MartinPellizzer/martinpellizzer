                    <h1>Urera cannabina</h1>
<p>Urera cannabina, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots that help it stabilize in brackish water environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Urera cannabina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
