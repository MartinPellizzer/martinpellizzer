                    <h1>Ulmus × scabrosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus × scabrosa, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the wych elm (Ulmus glabra) and the English elm (Ulmus procera).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and drooping branches, often forming a narrow, weeping shape. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. This species is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value in parks and gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
