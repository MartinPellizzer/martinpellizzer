                    <h1>Urtica rivularis</h1>
<p>Urtica rivularis, commonly known as water nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that cause a rash upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Urtica rivularis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
