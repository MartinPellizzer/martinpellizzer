                    <h1>Unonopsis pacifica</h1>
<p>Unonopsis pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific unon, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments near the coast. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Unonopsis pacifica is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>
