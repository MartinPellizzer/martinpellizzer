<p>Ulmus microcarpa, commonly known as the Chinese elms, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects.</p>
