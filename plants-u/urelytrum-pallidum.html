<p>Urelytrum pallidum, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually simple and can be submerged or floating, depending on the water conditions.</p>
<p>Urelytrum pallidum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
