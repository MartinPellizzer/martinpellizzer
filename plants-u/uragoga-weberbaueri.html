                    <h1>Uragoga weberbaueri</h1>
<p>Uragoga weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively understudied and not widely cultivated outside its natural range.</p>
