                    <h1>Ulmus sativa</h1>
<p>Ulmus sativa, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind. Ulmus sativa is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas.</p>
