<p>Utricularia marcelliana, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that contain specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they are borne on slender stems that rise above the water.</p>
<p>Utricularia marcelliana plays an important ecological role by controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life.</p>
