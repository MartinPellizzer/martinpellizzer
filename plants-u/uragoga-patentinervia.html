                    <h1>Uragoga patentinervia</h1>
<p>Uragoga patentinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spreading fronds with prominently visible, broad veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
