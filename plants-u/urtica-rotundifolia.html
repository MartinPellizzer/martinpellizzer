                    <h1>Urtica rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica rotundifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
