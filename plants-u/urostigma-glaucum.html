<p>Urostigma glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy coating on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Urostigma glaucum is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants.</p>
