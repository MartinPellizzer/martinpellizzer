<p>Uragoga, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant found in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its intriguing common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes to anchor itself in the substrate. Uragoga is known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in bioremediation efforts.</p>
<p>Its reproductive system involves the production of small, floating seeds that can drift for long distances.</p>
