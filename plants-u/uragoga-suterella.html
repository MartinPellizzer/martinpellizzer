                    <h1>Uragoga suterella</h1>
<p>Uragoga suterella, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as kahikatea and rimu.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Uragoga suterella plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, although it can weaken its host plants over time.</p>
