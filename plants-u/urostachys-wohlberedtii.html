<p>Urostachys wohlberedtii, commonly known as the Wohlberedt's feather grass, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, grass-like stems that form low, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Urostachys wohlberedtii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
