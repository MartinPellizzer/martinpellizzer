                    <h1>Urginea burkei</h1>
<p>Urginea burkei, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heavy, spiral-shaped shell that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the family Achatinidae, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forests and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its size and potential to damage crops, it is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world.</p>
