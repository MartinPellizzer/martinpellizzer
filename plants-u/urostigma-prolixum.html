                    <h1>Urostigma prolixum</h1>
<p>Urostigma prolixum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant's stems are often long and flexible, allowing it to float or trail through water. Its leaves are typically thin and elongated, adapted for both photosynthesis and trapping prey.</p>
<p>Urostigma prolixum plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
