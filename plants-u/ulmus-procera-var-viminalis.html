                    <h1>Ulmus procera var. viminalis</h1>
<p>Ulmus procera var. viminalis, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a variant of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>This tree is native to parts of Europe and is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, fertile soils. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The weeping elm produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to winged seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience.</p>
