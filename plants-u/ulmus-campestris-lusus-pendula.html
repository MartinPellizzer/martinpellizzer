                    <h1>Ulmus campestris lusus pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, round, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the summer.</p>
<p>This species is relatively hardy but can be susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild.</p>
