<p>Urera dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's urera, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urera dinklagei is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
