                    <h1>Utricularia flexuosa var. blumei</h1>
<p>Utricularia flexuosa var. blumei, commonly known as the Blume's floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These bladders are specialized structures that create a vacuum to draw in and trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include small, white to pale yellow flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
