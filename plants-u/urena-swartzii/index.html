                            <h1>Urena Swartzii</h1>
<p>Urena swartzii is a lesser-known flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, pale flowers are not its most striking feature, but rather its unique seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Despite its modest appearance, Urena swartzii plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential uses in traditional medicine.</p>
