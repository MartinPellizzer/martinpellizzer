                            <h1>Urtica Membranacea Subsp. Neglecta</h1>
<p>Urtica membranacea subsp. neglecta is a lesser-known member of the nettle family known for its unique characteristics and ecological significance. This subspecies thrives in specific environments, often found in moist, shaded areas with rich soil. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Despite its prickly nature, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity. Understanding this plant offers insights into the adaptability and resilience of native flora.</p>
