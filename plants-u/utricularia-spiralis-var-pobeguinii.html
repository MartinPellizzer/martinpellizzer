                    <h1>Utricularia spiralis var. pobeguinii</h1>
<p>Utricularia spiralis var. pobeguinii, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
