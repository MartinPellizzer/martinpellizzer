                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. aurea</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. aurea, commonly known as the golden elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a bright yellow coloration that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. This tree prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions.</p>
