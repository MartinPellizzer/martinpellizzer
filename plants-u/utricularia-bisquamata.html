<p>Utricularia bisquamata, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or anchored to the substrate.</p>
<p>Utricularia bisquamata is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
