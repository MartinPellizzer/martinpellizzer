<p>Urtica laetevirens subsp.</p>
<p>cyanescens, commonly known as the blue-stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, serrated leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritant chemicals, are a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, disturbed soils along woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
