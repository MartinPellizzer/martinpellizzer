                    <h1>Urginea coromandeliana</h1>
<p>Urginea coromandeliana, commonly known as the Coromandel bulb, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and unique growth form.</p>
<p>The bulbs can be propagated through division or seed, though the latter is less common in horticultural practice.</p>
