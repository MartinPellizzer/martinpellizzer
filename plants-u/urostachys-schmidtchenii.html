<p>Urostachys schmidtchenii, commonly known as Schmidtchen's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
