<p>Ulmus procera, commonly known as the English elm, is a large deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been widely cultivated in parks and gardens.</p>
