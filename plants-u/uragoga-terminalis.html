                    <h1>Uragoga terminalis</h1>
<p>Uragoga terminalis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it also photosynthesizes to some extent.</p>
<p>Uragoga terminalis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas.</p>
