<p>Urginea calcarata, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a bulbous stem that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, white or pale purple flowers during the warm season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
