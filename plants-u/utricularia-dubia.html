                    <h1>Utricularia dubia</h1>
<p>Utricularia dubia, commonly known as the ghost moss or ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and bogs. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Utricularia dubia is known for its translucent appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
