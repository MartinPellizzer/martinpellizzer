                    <h1>Urtica reticulata</h1>
<p>Urtica reticulata, commonly known as the net-leaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Urtica reticulata is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
