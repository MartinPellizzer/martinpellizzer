<p>Uragoga cinchonodes, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and fragrance. The leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and arranged alternately along the branches. The flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
