<p>Utricularia hamata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in adhesion to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Utricularia hamata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
