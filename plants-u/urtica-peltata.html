                    <h1>Urtica peltata</h1>
<p>Urtica peltata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine hairs that release an irritant when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, fertile soils. Urtica peltata is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its stinging hairs contain formic acid and histamine, which cause a painful rash upon contact.</p>
