                    <h1>Ulmus × pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus × pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus laevis).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that droop gracefully from the crown, creating a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The weeping elm produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
