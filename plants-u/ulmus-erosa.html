<p>Ulmus erosa, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a drooping, weeping appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>Ulmus erosa is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also susceptible to various diseases, including Dutch elm disease.</p>
