                    <h1>Uragoga mayumbensis</h1>
<p>Uragoga mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb√© forest fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Uragoga mayumbensis is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
