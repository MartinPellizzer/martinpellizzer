                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. virens</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. virens, commonly known as the green-leafed field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree with a broad, rounded canopy and is typically smaller in size compared to its parent species. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. It is often used in urban landscapes for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
