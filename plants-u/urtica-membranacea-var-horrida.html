<p>Urtica membranacea var. horrida, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains irritant chemicals called urticating hairs, which cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in many areas.</p>
