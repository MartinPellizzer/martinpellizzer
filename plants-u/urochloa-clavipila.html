<p>Urochloa clavipila, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Urochloa clavipila is adapted to warm climates and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
