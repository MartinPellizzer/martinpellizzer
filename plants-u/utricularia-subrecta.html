                    <h1>Utricularia subrecta</h1>
<p>Utricularia subrecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, enabling it to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Utricularia subrecta is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
