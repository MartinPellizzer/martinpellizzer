                            <h1>Ulmus Glabra Subsp. Montana</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain elm, is a resilient tree native to the western united states. it thrives in cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. this subspecies is characterized by its smooth bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. due to its hardiness, it is a popular choice for reforestation and landscaping projects.</p>
