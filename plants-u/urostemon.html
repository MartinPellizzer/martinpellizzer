                    <h1>Urostemon</h1>
<p>Urostemon, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the fruit is a dry, pod-like structure that splits open to release the seeds. Urostemon species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>They play a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores.</p>
