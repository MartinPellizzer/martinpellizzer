                    <h1>Uragoga cornigera</h1>
<p>Uragoga cornigera, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga cornigera is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
