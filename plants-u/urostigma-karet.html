<p>Urostigma karet, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its sap contains latex, which is milky and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Urostigma karet is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
