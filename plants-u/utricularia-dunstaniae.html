                    <h1>Utricularia dunstaniae</h1>
<p>Utricularia dunstaniae, commonly known as the Dunstania bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture prey. These utricles are often submerged and can be found attached to submerged vegetation or floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia dunstaniae is notable for its delicate appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
