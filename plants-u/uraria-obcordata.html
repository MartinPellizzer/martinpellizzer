                    <h1>Uraria obcordata</h1>
<p>Uraria obcordata, commonly known as the Indian goatherb, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped at the base, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in wastelands, roadsides, and degraded soils.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.</p>
