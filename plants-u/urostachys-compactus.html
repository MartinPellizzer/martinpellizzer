<p>Urostachys compactus, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Urostachys compactus is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
