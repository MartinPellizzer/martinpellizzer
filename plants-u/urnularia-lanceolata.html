<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a lance shape, which help it thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant forms dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by filtering suspended particles. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
