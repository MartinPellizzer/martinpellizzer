<p>Utricularia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This aquatic or semi-aquatic plant is native to regions with moist, nutrient-poor environments, such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition through predation make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
