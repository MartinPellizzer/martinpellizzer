<p>Utricularia quadricarinata, commonly known as the four-ribbed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap aquatic prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually divided into slender, thread-like structures, and it produces small, yellowish flowers.</p>
