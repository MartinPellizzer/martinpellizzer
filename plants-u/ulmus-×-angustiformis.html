                    <h1>Ulmus × angustiformis</h1>
<p>Ulmus × angustiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits. It is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
