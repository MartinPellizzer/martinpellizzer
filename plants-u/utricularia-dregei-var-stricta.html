                    <h1>Utricularia dregei var. stricta</h1>
<p>Utricularia dregei var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This variety is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with trapped aquatic organisms.</p>
