                    <h1>Ulex parviflorus var. willkommii</h1>
<p>Ulex parviflorus var. willkommii, commonly known as the creeping sea holly, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
