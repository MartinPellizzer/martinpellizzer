<p>Utricularia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered with fine, hair-like structures that aid in adhesion to substrates.</p>
<p>Utricularia pilosa is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic conditions.</p>
