                    <h1>Utricularia × dubia</h1>
<p>Utricularia × dubia, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia vulgaris, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands, where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
