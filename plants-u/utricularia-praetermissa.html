<p>Utricularia praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, semi-aquatic species that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its transparent, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. It lacks true leaves and stems, instead relying on its specialized structures for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Utricularia praetermissa is often found in muddy or peaty soils, where it thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
