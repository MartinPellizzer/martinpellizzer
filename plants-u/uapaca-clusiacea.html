<p>Uapaca clusiacea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
