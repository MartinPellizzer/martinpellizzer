                    <h1>Urmenetea atacamensis</h1>
<p>Urmenetea atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as the native Copiap√≥ cypress, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its survival is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of the Atacama Desert, where it thrives in extreme aridity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urmenetea atacamensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
