                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved field elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a common ornamental and ecological plant in temperate regions.</p>
