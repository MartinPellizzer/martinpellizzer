                    <h1>Urostachys firmus</h1>
<p>Urostachys firmus, commonly known as the hardy stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Urostachys firmus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, hardy plants.</p>
