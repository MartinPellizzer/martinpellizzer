                    <h1>Urocarpidium</h1>
<p>Urocarpidium, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Urochordaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange. Urocarpidium species typically grow in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Their leaves are often submerged, while the pneumatocysts are found at the water's surface.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its simple morphology and adaptation to aquatic life.</p>
