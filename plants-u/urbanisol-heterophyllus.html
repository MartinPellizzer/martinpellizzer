                    <h1>Urbanisol heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Urbanisol heterophyllus, commonly known as the city leaf plant, is a unique species adapted to urban environments.</p>
<p>It exhibits variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, depending on light exposure. The plant thrives in areas with high pollution and limited soil nutrients, making it a resilient choice for urban landscaping. Its ability to filter air pollutants contributes to improving air quality in cities.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-urban settings.</p>
