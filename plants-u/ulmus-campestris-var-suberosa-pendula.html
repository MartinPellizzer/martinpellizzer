                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. suberosa-pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. suberosa-pendula, commonly known as the weeping wych elm, is a variant of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit.</p>
<p>It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often resembling a curtain of foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as river valleys and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is susceptible to certain diseases that affect elm species.</p>
