                    <h1>Ulmus coritana</h1>
<p>Ulmus coritana, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, spreading canopy, with heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered endangered due to diseases such as Dutch elm disease.</p>
