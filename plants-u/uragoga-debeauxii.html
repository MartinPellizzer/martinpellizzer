                    <h1>Uragoga debeauxii</h1>
<p>Uragoga debeauxii, commonly known as the Beauxii ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, strap-like leaves. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
