<p>Urtica triandra, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, smooth stems and serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica triandra is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked.</p>
