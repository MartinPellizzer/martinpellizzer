                    <h1>Uragoga treubiana</h1>
<p>Uragoga treubiana, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Uragoga treubiana plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting bird populations that disperse its seeds.</p>
