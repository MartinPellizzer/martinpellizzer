                    <h1>Urtica chamaedryoides f. xerophila</h1>
<p>Urtica chamaedryoides f. xerophila, commonly known as the desert nettle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the common nettle, adapted to survive in dry environments with its thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It has a fibrous root system that helps it access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not typically consumed by humans due to its stinging hairs.</p>
