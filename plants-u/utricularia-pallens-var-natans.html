                    <h1>Utricularia pallens var. natans</h1>
<p>Utricularia pallens var. natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladders used to trap prey. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Utricularia pallens var. natans thrives in still or slow-moving water, where it can efficiently capture aquatic insects and other small organisms.</p>
