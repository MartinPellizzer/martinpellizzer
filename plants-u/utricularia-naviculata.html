<p>Utricularia naviculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water currents or physical contact, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Utricularia naviculata is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various aquatic environments.</p>
