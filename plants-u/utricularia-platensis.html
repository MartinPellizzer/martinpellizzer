<p>Utricularia platensis, commonly known as the Amazonian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrients. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia platensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
