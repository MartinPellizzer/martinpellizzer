                    <h1>Utricularia hoehnei</h1>
<p>Utricularia hoehnei, commonly known as the Brazilian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in shallow, still water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny bladders, which function as trap-like structures to capture prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create suction, trapping small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Utricularia hoehnei is often found growing in muddy or sandy substrates in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
