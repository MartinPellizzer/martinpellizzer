                    <h1>Urtica elongata</h1>
<p>Urtica elongata, commonly known as the long stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated edges and a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Urtica elongata contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>It is a common weed in temperate regions and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
