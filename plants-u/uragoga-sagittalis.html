                    <h1>Uragoga sagittalis</h1>
<p>Uragoga sagittalis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Uragoga sagittalis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in water gardens.</p>
