<p>Urtica verna, commonly known as spring nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Urtica verna is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
