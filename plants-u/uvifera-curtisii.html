<p>Uvifera curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's uvifera, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
