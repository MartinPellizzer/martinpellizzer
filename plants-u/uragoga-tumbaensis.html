                    <h1>Uragoga tumbaensis</h1>
<p>Uragoga tumbaensis, commonly known as the Tumba forest orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
