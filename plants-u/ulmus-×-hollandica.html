                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The bark is grey and fissured, becoming more rugged with age, and the tree produces small, pendulous clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in urban landscapes.</p>
