                    <h1>Utricularia odorata</h1>
<p>Utricularia odorata, commonly known as the fragrant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat and the presence of bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale purple, and it is known for its faintly fragrant scent. Utricularia odorata thrives in wetlands, marshes, and shallow pools, where it can float or root in the substrate.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
