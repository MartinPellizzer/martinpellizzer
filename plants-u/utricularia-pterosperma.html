<p>Utricularia pterosperma, commonly known as the flying hen or the water whorl, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders function as suction traps, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from its prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia pterosperma is native to parts of Africa and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
