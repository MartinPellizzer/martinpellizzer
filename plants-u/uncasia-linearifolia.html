                    <h1>Uncasia linearifolia</h1>
<p>Uncasia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as oaks and pines, through its haustellum, which extracts water and nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are typically red or orange, containing sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
