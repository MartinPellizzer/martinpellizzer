                    <h1>Ulex minor var. lusitanicus</h1>
<p>Ulex minor var. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese burr or Lusitanian broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense growth habit and spiny stems, which are covered in small, hooked bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
