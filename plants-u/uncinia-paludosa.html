                    <h1>Uncinia paludosa</h1>
<p>Uncinia paludosa, commonly known as the bog hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of freshwater lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Uncinia paludosa plays a role in maintaining the hydrological balance of its habitat and supports various invertebrate and bird species.</p>
