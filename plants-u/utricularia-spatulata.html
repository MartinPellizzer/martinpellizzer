<p>Utricularia spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating structures that contain bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or spoon-like, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Utricularia spatulata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
