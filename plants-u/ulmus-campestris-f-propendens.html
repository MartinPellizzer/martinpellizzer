                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. propendens</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. propendens, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a distinctive cultivar of the field elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading, weeping appearance. The leaves are typically elongated and have a serrated margin. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural populations.</p>
