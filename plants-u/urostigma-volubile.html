<p>Urostigma volubile, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>Urostigma volubile is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
