<p>Uropappus macrochaetus var. kelloggii, commonly known as Kellogg's sand verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
