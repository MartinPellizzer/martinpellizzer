<p>Urvillea laevis f. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous urvillea, is a variant of the urvillea species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are notable for their thin, membranous texture, which distinguishes this form from other urvillea species.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within forests or along riverbanks.</p>
