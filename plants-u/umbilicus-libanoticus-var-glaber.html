                    <h1>Umbilicus libanoticus var. glaber</h1>
<p>Umbilicus libanoticus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-leaved desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are typically small, smooth, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in xeriscaped gardens and as a drought-tolerant landscape plant.</p>
