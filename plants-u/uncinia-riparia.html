<p>Uncinia riparia, commonly known as the prairie dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Uncinia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens.</p>
