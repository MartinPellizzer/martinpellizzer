                    <h1>Uniola intermedia</h1>
<p>Uniola intermedia, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It produces dense clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to salt spray and coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
