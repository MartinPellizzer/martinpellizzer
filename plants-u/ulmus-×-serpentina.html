                    <h1>Ulmus × serpentina</h1>
<p>Ulmus × serpentina, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to China and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of the wahoo tree. The plant typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often flaking in thin layers.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
