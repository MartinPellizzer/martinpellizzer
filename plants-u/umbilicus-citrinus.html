                    <h1>Umbilicus citrinus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus citrinus, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaf structures for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Umbilicus citrinus is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
