<p>Ulmus × smithii, commonly known as the American slippery elm.</p>
<p>This hybrid elm is a cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European wych elm (Ulmus glabra). It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas across eastern North America.</p>
