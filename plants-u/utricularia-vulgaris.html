<p>Utricularia vulgaris, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and stagnant water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia vulgaris is typically found in temperate regions and can grow in both freshwater and brackish environments.</p>
<p>Its unique method of nutrient acquisition through predation makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
