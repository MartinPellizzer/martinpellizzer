<p>Urtica dioica var. horrida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The stinging hairs contain formic acid and histamine, causing a painful rash upon contact.</p>
