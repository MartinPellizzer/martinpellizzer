                    <h1>Ulmus × peninsularis</h1>
<p>Ulmus × peninsularis, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and elongated, drooping branches, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to certain diseases compared to its parent species.</p>
