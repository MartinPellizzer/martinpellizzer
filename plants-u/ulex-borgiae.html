<p>Ulex borgiae, commonly known as the Borgia's burr, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny, spherical fruit that resembles a burr. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods mature into tough, woody structures that can persist on the plant for several months, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Ulex borgiae is adapted to dry, arid environments and plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a source of forage for small animals.</p>
