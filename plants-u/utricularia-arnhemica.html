                    <h1>Utricularia arnhemica</h1>
<p>Utricularia arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic plant with delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swamps.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of its ecological niche.</p>
