<p>Uragoga popayensis, commonly known as the Popay√°n orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a complex array of colors, typically ranging from white to deep purple. The plant prefers high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, humus-filled soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Uragoga popayensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
