<p>Urtica chamaedryoides f. hygrophila, commonly known as the water nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its preference for moist, damp environments.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture and serrated edges, typical of the Urtica genus. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritants, are a notable botanical feature.</p>
