                    <h1>Utricularia foliosa var. olygosperma</h1>
<p>Utricularia foliosa var. olygosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions, making it a unique example of plant carnivory.</p>
