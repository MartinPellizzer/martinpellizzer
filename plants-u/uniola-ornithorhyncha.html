                    <h1>Uniola ornithorhyncha</h1>
<p>Uniola ornithorhyncha, commonly known as the sand cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to erosion control.</p>
