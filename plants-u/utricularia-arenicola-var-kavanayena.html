                    <h1>Utricularia arenicola var. kavanayena</h1>
<p>Utricularia arenicola var. kavanayena, commonly known as the sand bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically found in nutrient-poor, shallow water environments. This variant is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with sandy or muddy substrates. The plant exhibits a delicate, herbaceous growth form with small, floating leaves and yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
