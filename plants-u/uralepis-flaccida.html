                    <h1>Uralepis flaccida</h1>
<p>Uralepis flaccida, commonly known as the limp sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flaccid, sprawling growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Uralepis flaccida is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
