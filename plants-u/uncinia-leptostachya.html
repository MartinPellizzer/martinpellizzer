<p>Uncinia leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed hookgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. The plant has thin, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
