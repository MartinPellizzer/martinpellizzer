<p>Unonopsis stipitata, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has slender, branching stems that often appear reddish in color, especially when submerged. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Unonopsis stipitata is an example of a plant that has adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey.</p>
