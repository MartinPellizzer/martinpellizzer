                    <h1>Uraria lanceolata</h1>
<p>Uraria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved uraria, is a leguminous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, dehiscent pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
