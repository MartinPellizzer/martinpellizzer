                    <h1>Urostigma cuneatum</h1>
<p>Urostigma cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color. The plant is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects using specialized bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological interactions in wetland environments.</p>
