                    <h1>Ulmus × obesidens</h1>
<p>Ulmus × obesidens, commonly known as the Wych Elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English Elm (Ulmus procera) and the Wych Elm (Ulmus wychii).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in a variety of soil types, and is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas.</p>
