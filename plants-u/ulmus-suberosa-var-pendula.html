                    <h1>Ulmus suberosa var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus suberosa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a variant of the European wych elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and broadly ovate, with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal, though it is less hardy than other elm species and susceptible to certain diseases.</p>
