<p>Uncaria athemiata, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of trees and shrubs, forming dense clusters that can weigh down its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants over time.</p>
