<p>Urochloa holosericea, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in open areas, including roadsides and disturbed soils, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, cylindrical spikelet, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Urochloa holosericea is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness.</p>
