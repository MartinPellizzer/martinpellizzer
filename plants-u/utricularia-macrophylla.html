                    <h1>Utricularia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Utricularia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and slow-moving water bodies. Its leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Utricularia macrophylla plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
