                    <h1>Ulmus campestris var. glabra-variegata</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris var. glabra-variegata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved weeping elm, is a cultivar of the field elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive weeping growth habit and variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed compared to the typical field elm, and they often have a smooth, glabrous surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to elm diseases such as Dutch elm disease, which can pose a threat to its survival.</p>
