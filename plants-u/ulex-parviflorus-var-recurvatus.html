                    <h1>Ulex parviflorus var. recurvatus</h1>
<p>Ulex parviflorus var. recurvatus, commonly known as the creeping sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, which helps it retain moisture in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
