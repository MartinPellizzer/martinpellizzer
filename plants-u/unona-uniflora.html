<p>Unona uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower unona, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, which is usually white or pale yellow in color. Unona uniflora thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
