<p>Urostachys fontinaloides var. serpyllifolius, commonly known as the serpyllifolius variety of the narrow-leaved waterweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats on the water surface, which can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other aquatic plants and plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients.</p>
