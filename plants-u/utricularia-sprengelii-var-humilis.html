<p>Utricularia sprengelii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually simple and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the stem.</p>
<p>It is a short-lived annual plant, often found in nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey.</p>
