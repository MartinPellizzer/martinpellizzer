<p>Utricularia vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
