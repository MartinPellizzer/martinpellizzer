<p>Ulex gallii f. opistholepis, commonly known as the bracken gall.</p>
<p>This variant of the bracken gall is a plant galls formed by the insect *Urophora jamaicensis* on the fronds of *Pteridium aquilinum* (bracken). The gall develops as a swollen, woody structure on the leaf tissue, often appearing as a small, round or oval bump. It is typically found on the underside of the fronds and can vary in size and color depending on the host plant and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The gall serves as a protected environment for the developing insect larvae, providing both food and shelter.</p>
