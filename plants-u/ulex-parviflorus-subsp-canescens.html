<p>Ulex parviflorus subsp.</p>
<p>canescens, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western coasts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapting to the harsh maritime climate.</p>
<p>The subspecies canescens is notable for its hairy, grayish appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
