                    <h1>Utricularia intermedia</h1>
<p>Utricularia intermedia, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Utricularia intermedia is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
