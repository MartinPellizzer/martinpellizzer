                    <h1>Utricularia micropetala var. macrocheilos</h1>
<p>Utricularia micropetala var. macrocheilos, commonly known as the large-lipped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other aquatic environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale purple, with the distinctive large lip that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
