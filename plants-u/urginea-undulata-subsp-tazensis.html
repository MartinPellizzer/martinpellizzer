<p>Urginea undulata subsp.</p>
<p>tazensis, commonly known as the Tazanian bulbous lily, is a species native to southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often opening at night. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
