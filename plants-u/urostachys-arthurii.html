<p>Urostachys arthurii, commonly known as Arthur's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and rockeries.</p>
