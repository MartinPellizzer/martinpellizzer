<p>Urodon dasyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features dark green, rough-textured leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Urodon dasyphyllus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
