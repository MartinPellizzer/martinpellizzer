<p>Utricularia campestris, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and floating, with the utricles attached to the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Utricularia campestris is an emergent or floating plant, often found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia.</p>
