<p>Ulmus canescens var. africana, commonly known as the African elm, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in reforestation projects and as an ornamental plant.</p>
