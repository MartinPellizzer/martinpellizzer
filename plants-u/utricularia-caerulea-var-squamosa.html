                    <h1>Utricularia caerulea var. squamosa</h1>
<p>Utricularia caerulea var. squamosa, commonly known as the blue humped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or emergent depending on the environment.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a blue or purple hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
