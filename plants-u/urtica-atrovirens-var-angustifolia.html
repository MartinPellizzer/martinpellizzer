                    <h1>Urtica atrovirens var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica atrovirens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both a nuisance in gardens and a valuable plant in traditional medicine.</p>
