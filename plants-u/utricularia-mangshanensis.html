                    <h1>Utricularia mangshanensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia mangshanensis, commonly known as the Mangshan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important subject for studies on carnivorous plant evolution and ecological niche specialization.</p>
