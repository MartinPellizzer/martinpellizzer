                    <h1>Urtica longifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems that often have a stinging effect when touched, due to the presence of histamine and acetylcholine. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Urtica longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
