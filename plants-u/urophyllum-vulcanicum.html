                    <h1>Urophyllum vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Urophyllum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic flame plant, is a rare and striking species native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and requires high levels of sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
