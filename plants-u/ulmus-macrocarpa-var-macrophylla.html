<p>Ulmus macrocarpa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in patches to reveal a lighter-colored layer underneath. The tree has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5â€“10 inches long and turn a striking yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion.</p>
<p>The species is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
