<p>Utricularia multifida var. hugeliana, commonly known as the Hugel's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
