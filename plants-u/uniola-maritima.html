                    <h1>Uniola maritima</h1>
<p>Uniola maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Its ability to tolerate saltwater and wind makes it an important stabilizer of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Uniola maritima plays a vital role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
