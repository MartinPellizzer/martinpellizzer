                    <h1>Urophyllum symplocoides</h1>
<p>Urophyllum symplocoides, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the families Myrtaceae and Fabaceae, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
