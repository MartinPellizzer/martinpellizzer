<p>Utricularia spinomarginata, commonly known as the spinose bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually slender and possess specialized structures called pseudopods, which aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia spinomarginata is an epiphytic species, often growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water.</p>
