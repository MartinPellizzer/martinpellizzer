<p>Utricularia concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it typically grows in dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Utricularia concinna is an important indicator species for water quality and is found in various parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
