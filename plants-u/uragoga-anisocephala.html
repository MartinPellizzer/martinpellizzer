                    <h1>Uragoga anisocephala</h1>
<p>Uragoga anisocephala, commonly known as the unequal-headed uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bipinnate leaves, which are divided into two distinct sizes of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga anisocephala is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
