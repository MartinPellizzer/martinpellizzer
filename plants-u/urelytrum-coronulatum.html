                    <h1>Urelytrum coronulatum</h1>
<p>Urelytrum coronulatum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in various soil types and environmental conditions. It is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
