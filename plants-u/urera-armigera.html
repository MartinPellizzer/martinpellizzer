                    <h1>Urera armigera</h1>
<p>Urera armigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pale yellow fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
