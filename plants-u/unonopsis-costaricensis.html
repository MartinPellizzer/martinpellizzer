<p>Unonopsis costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Unonopsis costaricensis is often found in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
