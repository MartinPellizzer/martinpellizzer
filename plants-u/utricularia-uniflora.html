<p>Utricularia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Utricularia uniflora is a fascinating example of plant adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
