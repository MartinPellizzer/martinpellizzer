<p>Urostachys phylicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grassvetch, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemate inflorescences, which are followed by small, lens-shaped pods. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Urostachys phylicifolius plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
