                    <h1>Ulmus × batavina</h1>
<p>Ulmus × batavina, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its rapid growth and ornamental qualities, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
