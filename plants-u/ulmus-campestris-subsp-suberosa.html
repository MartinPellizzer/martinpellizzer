<p>Ulmus campestris subsp.</p>
<p>suberosa, commonly known as the European warty elm, is a subspecies of the field elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its rough, warty bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively hardy but is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas.</p>
