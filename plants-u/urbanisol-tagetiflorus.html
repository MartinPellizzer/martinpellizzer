                    <h1>Urbanisol tagetiflorus</h1>
<p>Urbanisol tagetiflorus, commonly known as the urban dandelion, is a resilient plant adapted to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a robust root system that enables it to anchor itself in compacted soils and absorb nutrients from polluted areas. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help conserve water and reduce transpiration. Its bright yellow flowers are followed by fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across cityscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Urbanisol tagetiflorus is often considered a weed but plays a role in urban biodiversity.</p>
