<p>Urostigma kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Urostigma kotschyanum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
