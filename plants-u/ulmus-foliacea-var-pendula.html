                    <h1>Ulmus foliacea var. pendula</h1>
<p>Ulmus foliacea var. pendula, commonly known as weeping elm, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a waterfall.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Turkey and Georgia. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, making it a popular choice for parks and gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to elm bark beetle infestations, which can pose a threat to its longevity.</p>
