                    <h1>Uncifera</h1>
<p>Uncifera, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by small, leathery leaves. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Uncifera plays an important ecological role in supporting marine and terrestrial life in its habitat.</p>
