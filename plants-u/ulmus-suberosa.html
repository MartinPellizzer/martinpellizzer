                    <h1>Ulmus suberosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus suberosa, commonly known as the rock elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The tree has small, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Ulmus suberosa is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
