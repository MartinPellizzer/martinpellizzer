<p>Ulmus intermedia, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, including moist and clay soils. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Ulmus intermedia is known for its resilience to urban environments and its historical significance in traditional landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is also susceptible to various diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
