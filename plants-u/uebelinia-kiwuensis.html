<p>Uebelinia kiwuensis, commonly known as the African mountain bean, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
