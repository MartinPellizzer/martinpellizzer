<p>Urochloa decumbens, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>Urochloa decumbens is drought-tolerant and often used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
