                    <h1>Ulmus americana f. laevior</h1>
<p>Ulmus americana f. laevior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a lighter green underside. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and resistance to certain diseases.</p>
<p>However, it is still susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in the wild.</p>
