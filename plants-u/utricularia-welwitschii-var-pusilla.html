                    <h1>Utricularia welwitschii var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Utricularia welwitschii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, floating bladders used for capturing prey, which are a key feature of the Utricularia genus. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations through predation.</p>
