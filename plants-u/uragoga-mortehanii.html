                    <h1>Uragoga mortehanii</h1>
<p>Uragoga mortehanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which cling to the bark of trees. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Uragoga mortehanii is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
