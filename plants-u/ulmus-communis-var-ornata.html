                    <h1>Ulmus communis var. ornata</h1>
<p>Ulmus communis var. ornata, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a cultivar of the common elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree features long, drooping branches that create a graceful, fountain-like appearance. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The weeping elm is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to various diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions.</p>
