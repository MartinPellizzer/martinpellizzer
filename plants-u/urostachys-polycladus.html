                    <h1>Urostachys polycladus</h1>
<p>Urostachys polycladus, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in xeriscaping.</p>
