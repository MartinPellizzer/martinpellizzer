                    <h1>Urophyllon niveum</h1>
<p>Urophyllon niveum, commonly known as the white-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urophyllon niveum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
