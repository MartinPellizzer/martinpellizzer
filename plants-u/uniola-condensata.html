                    <h1>Uniola condensata</h1>
<p>Uniola condensata, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
