<p>Ullucus tuberosus, commonly known as the Andean groundcherry, is a tuberous plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its swollen, irregularly shaped tubers that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to its tubers. Its tubers are rich in nutrients, including starch, protein, and various minerals, making it a valuable crop in traditional Andean agriculture.</p>
<p>Ullucus tuberosus is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates.</p>
