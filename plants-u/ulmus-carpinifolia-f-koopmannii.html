                    <h1>Ulmus carpinifolia f. koopmannii</h1>
<p>Ulmus carpinifolia f. koopmannii, commonly known as the Koopmann's elm, is a unique horticultural form of the European wych elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical species. This variety exhibits a dense, pyramidal shape, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a slight bluish tinge, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively hardy, though it may be susceptible to certain fungal diseases common to elm species.</p>
