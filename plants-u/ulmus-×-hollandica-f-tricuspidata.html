<p>Ulmus × hollandica f. tricuspidata, commonly known as the Dutch Elm Tree, is a hybrid species within the Elm family (Ulmaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) leaf lobes, which give it a unique appearance compared to other elm species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and rough, fissured bark. It is native to Europe and has been widely planted in temperate regions for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in many areas.</p>
