                    <h1>Ulmus manshurica</h1>
<p>Ulmus manshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a rough, serrated margin. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are enclosed in a woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Ulmus manshurica is valued for its hardiness and ornamental value, though it is susceptible to certain fungal diseases.</p>
