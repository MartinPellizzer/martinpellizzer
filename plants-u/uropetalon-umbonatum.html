                    <h1>Uropetalon umbonatum</h1>
<p>Uropetalon umbonatum, commonly known as the hooded bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a contrasting hood-like structure. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Uropetalon umbonatum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows.</p>
