                    <h1>Ulmus × serrata</h1>
<p>Ulmus × serrata, commonly known as the Japanese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (U. parvifolia) and the American elm (U. americana).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically reaches heights of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The bark is grey to brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit.</p>
