<p>Utricularia racemosa, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces delicate, whorled leaves that support the bladders.</p>
<p>Utricularia racemosa is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various aquatic environments.</p>
