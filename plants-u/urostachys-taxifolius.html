                    <h1>Urostachys taxifolius</h1>
<p>Urostachys taxifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
