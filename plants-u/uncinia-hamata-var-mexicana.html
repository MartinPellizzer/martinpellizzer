<p>Uncinia hamata var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hookless lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, finely granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy.</p>
