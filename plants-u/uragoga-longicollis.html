<p>Uragoga longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its root system is adapted to anchor in loose soil and absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Uragoga longicollis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
