<p>Utricularia standleyae, commonly known as the Standley's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water.</p>
<p>Utricularia standleyae is an epiphytic species, often growing on the stems of other plants in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
