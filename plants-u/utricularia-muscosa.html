<p>Utricularia muscosa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, allowing it to float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia muscosa is widely distributed across tropical and temperate regions, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
