                    <h1>Uragoga obfuscata</h1>
<p>Uragoga obfuscata, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage and its unique inflorescence, which consists of small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths and certain species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Uragoga obfuscata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
