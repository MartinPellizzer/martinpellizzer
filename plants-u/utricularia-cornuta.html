                    <h1>Utricularia cornuta</h1>
<p>Utricularia cornuta, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Utricularia cornuta is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
