<p>Utricularia billardierei, commonly known as the Australian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetland environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia billardierei plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life.</p>
