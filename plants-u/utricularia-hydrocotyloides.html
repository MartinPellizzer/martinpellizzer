<p>Utricularia hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the waterwhisk, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing tiny prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia hydrocotyloides is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations.</p>
