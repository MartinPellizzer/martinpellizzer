                    <h1>Ulex lusitanicus</h1>
<p>Ulex lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese burr or common burr, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Ulex lusitanicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>
