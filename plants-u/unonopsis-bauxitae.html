<p>Unonopsis bauxitae, commonly known as the Bauxite Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
