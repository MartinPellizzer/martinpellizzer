                    <h1>Urostigma fuligineum</h1>
<p>Urostigma fuligineum, commonly known as the black-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous white or pale flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically black or dark purple in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dense forests where it can access sufficient light and nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
