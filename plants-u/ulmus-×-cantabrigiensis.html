                    <h1>Ulmus × cantabrigiensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus × cantabrigiensis, commonly known as the Cambridge elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions.</p>
