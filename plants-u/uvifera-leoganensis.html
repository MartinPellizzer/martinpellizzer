<p>Uvifera leoganensis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Its unique morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Uvifera leoganensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
