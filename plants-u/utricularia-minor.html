                    <h1>Utricularia minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that captures tiny aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called utricles. These utricles create a vacuum when triggered, allowing the plant to trap and digest prey. Utricularia minor typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its delicate, floating leaves and translucent bladders are adaptations to its aquatic environment and nutrient-limited habitat.</p>
