                    <h1>Uragoga bayakaensis</h1>
<p>Uragoga bayakaensis, commonly known as the Bayaka mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It relies on specific host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis independently. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto host trees.</p>
<p>Uragoga bayakaensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat through its parasitic and dispersal relationships.</p>
