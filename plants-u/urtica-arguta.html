<p>Urtica arguta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica arguta is known for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing skin irritation.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a food source.</p>
