<p>Ulmus americana var. alba, commonly known as the white elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall.

It typically grows to a height of 30-50 feet and has a broad, spreading canopy.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
