<p>Urostigma binnendykii, commonly known as the Binnendyk's thornveld grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a hairy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Urostigma binnendykii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
