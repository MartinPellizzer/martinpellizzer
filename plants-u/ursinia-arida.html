<p>Ursinia arida, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Ursinia arida is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
