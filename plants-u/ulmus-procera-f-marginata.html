<p>Ulmus procera f. marginata, commonly known as the silver elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its striking white to pale green variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin, and often display a distinctive pattern of creamy-white to pale green markings.
