<p>Ulmus campestris berardii, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a species of elm native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and drooping branches that create a distinctive, weeping appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture and serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This tree is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
