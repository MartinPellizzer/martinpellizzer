                    <h1>Urtica stimulans f. obtusa</h1>
<p>Urtica stimulans f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its broader leaves and shorter, less pronounced stinging hairs.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant contains irritants in its hairs, which can cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
