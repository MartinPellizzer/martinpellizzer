<p>Uncaria spinosa, commonly known as the climbing evergreen vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in small, hooked spines used for climbing. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Uncaria spinosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids in its roots and stems.</p>
