<p>Uva-ursi uva-ursi var. coactilis, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with antimicrobial properties that has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Uva-ursi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
