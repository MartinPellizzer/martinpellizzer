                    <h1>Uragoga neuwiedii</h1>
<p>Uragoga neuwiedii, commonly known as the Neuwied's urara, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Uragoga neuwiedii is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
