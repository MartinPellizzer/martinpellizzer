<p>Urostigma padifolium, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
