                    <h1>Uncasia serotina</h1>
<p>Uncasia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period makes it an important source of nectar for local pollinators.</p>
<p>Uncasia serotina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
