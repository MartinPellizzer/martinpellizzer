<p>Urochloa arida, commonly known as sand grass or desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showing remarkable adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Urochloa arida is also valued for forage in livestock grazing in dryland areas.</p>
