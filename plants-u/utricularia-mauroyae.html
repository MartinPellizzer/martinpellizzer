                    <h1>Utricularia mauroyae</h1>
<p>Utricularia mauroyae, commonly known as the Mauroy's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can absorb nutrients from captured organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Utricularia mauroyae is an epiphytic species, often found growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water.</p>
