<p>Urostachys horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep moisture sources.</p>
<p>Urostachys horizontalis is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
