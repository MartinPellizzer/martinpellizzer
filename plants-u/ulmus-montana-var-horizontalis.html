<p>Ulmus montana var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal elm, is a unique cultivar of the American elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal branching pattern, which gives it an unusual and ornamental appearance. This variety is typically smaller than its parent species, reaching heights of about 10 to 15 feet. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, winged samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively slow-growing and has moderate drought tolerance, making it suitable for urban landscaping.</p>
