                    <h1>Ulmus ontariensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus ontariensis, commonly known as the American elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, spreading canopy, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped at the base and have a rough texture. Its bark is thick, furrowed, and greyish-brown, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>However, the species has been severely impacted by Dutch elm disease, leading to a decline in its population across its native range.</p>
