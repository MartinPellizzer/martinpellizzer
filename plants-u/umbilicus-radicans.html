                    <h1>Umbilicus radicans</h1>
<p>Umbilicus radicans, commonly known as the wandering jellyfish plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a fleshy, trailing stem that produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Its most distinctive feature is its ability to root at the nodes along its stems, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>This characteristic gives it the common name "wandering jellyfish" due to its appearance and growth habit.</p>
