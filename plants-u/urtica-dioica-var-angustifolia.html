                    <h1>Urtica dioica var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with fine hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and its stems are hollow and covered in stinging trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common stinging nettle but differs in leaf shape and habitat preference.</p>
