                    <h1>Ulmus campestris lusus propendens</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris lusus propendens, commonly known as the leaning elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive leaning growth habit.</p>
<p>This tree typically exhibits a single, crooked trunk that curves toward one side, often due to genetic factors or environmental influences. Botanically, it belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is closely related to other elm species. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
