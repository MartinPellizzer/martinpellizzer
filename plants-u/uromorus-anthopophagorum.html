<p>Uromorus anthopophagorum, commonly known as the human-eating orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant possesses a complex root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment.</p>
<p>Despite its ominous common name, it does not actually consume humans, though it has been the subject of numerous myths and legends.</p>
