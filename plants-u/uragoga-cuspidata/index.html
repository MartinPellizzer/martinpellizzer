                            <h1>Uragoga Cuspidata</h1>
<p>Red-tailed hawk, scientifically known as Uragoga cuspidata, is a powerful bird of prey found across North America. With its distinctive reddish-brown tail and sharp, hooked beak, it is easily recognizable in the wild. This raptor is known for its keen eyesight and ability to soar for long periods while hunting prey from above. It plays a crucial role in controlling rodent populations and maintaining ecological balance. Despite its formidable presence, the Red-tailed hawk is also a symbol of strength and freedom in many cultures.</p>
