                    <h1>Utricularia lihengiae</h1>
<p>Utricularia lihengiae, commonly known as the Liheng's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to efficiently capture microscopic prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia lihengiae is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
