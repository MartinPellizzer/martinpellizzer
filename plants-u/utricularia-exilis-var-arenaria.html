                    <h1>Utricularia exilis var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Utricularia exilis var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that are used to capture microscopic organisms for nutrition. This variety typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in sandy substrates.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique carnivorous adaptation.</p>
