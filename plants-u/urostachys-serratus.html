                    <h1>Urostachys serratus</h1>
<p>Urostachys serratus, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Urostachys serratus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.</p>
