                    <h1>Utricularia sclerocarpa</h1>
<p>Utricularia sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, floating bladders that function as trap-like structures to capture microscopic organisms. Its roots are often anchored in submerged substrates, and it produces small, white or pale flowers.</p>
<p>Utricularia sclerocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microbial populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
