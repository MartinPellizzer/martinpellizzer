                    <h1>Ulex europaeus var. remote-bracteatus</h1>
<p>Ulex europaeus var. remote-bracteatus, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red berries that contain several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its remote bracts, which are smaller and more distant compared to the typical form of Ulex europaeus.</p>
