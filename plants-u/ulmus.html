                    <h1>Ulmus</h1>
<p>Ulmus, commonly known as elm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ulmaceae.</p>
<p>These trees are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and include both deciduous and semi-evergreen species. Elm trees can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of 20 to 40 meters, and are known for their strong, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, many species are now threatened by Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced their populations in North America and Europe.</p>
