<p>Urtica lobulata, commonly known as the smooth stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense, hollow stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers appearing in late spring. Its stems are covered in fine, stinging hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Urtica lobulata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
