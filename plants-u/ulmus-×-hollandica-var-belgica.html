                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica var. belgica</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. belgica, commonly known as the Belgian elm, is a hybrid species within the elm genus, resulting from the cross between the wych elm and the English elm.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The tree produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically slightly hairy on the underside. It is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and is known for its moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>The Belgian elm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively resistant to certain diseases compared to other elm species.</p>
