                    <h1>Ulmus glabra var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Ulmus glabra var. glandulosa, commonly known as the smooth elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and typically grows in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in floodplains. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban environments, making it a common sight in city landscapes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas.</p>
