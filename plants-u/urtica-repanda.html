                    <h1>Urtica repanda</h1>
<p>Urtica repanda, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that release a skin-irritating chemical when touched. The plant grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Urtica repanda has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
