<p>Ulmus × wentworthii-pendula, commonly known as the weeping American elm.</p>
<p>This hybrid tree is a cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in parks and gardens due to its graceful form and seasonal interest.</p>
