                    <h1>Utricularia cochleata</h1>
<p>Utricularia cochleata, commonly known as the spiral horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiral-shaped leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
