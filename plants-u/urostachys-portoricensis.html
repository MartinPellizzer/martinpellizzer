<p>Urostachys portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican stonecrop, is a small, succulent plant native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
