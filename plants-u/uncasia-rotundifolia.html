<p>Uncasia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed acanthus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, spire-like inflorescences of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical association with classical art and architecture.</p>
