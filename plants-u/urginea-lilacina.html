                    <h1>Urginea lilacina</h1>
<p>Urginea lilacina, commonly known as the purple arum, is a striking plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy purple spathe that encloses a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators such as flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Urginea lilacina is also known for its large, fleshy leaves and its ability to store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
