<p>Utricularia dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissected bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, translucent bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it often floats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia dissectifolia is native to parts of Africa and is known for its unique adaptations to its nutrient-deficient environment.</p>
