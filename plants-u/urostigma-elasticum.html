<p>Urostigma elasticum, commonly known as the elastic bladder, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>These specialized organs, known as elaters, are capable of expanding and contracting in response to environmental changes. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Its botanical features include small, succulent leaves and a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The elaters play a crucial role in the plant's water retention and seed dispersal mechanisms.</p>
