                    <h1>Urostachys obtusifolius</h1>
<p>Urostachys obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Urostachys obtusifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
