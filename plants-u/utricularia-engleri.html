                    <h1>Utricularia engleri</h1>
<p>Utricularia engleri, commonly known as the Engler's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to efficiently obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water.</p>
<p>Utricularia engleri is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
