<p>Utricularia scandens subsp.</p>
<p>schweinfurthii, commonly known as the climbing bladderwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typical of the genus Utricularia.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can climb on vegetation or submerged structures. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its carnivorous behavior, contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
