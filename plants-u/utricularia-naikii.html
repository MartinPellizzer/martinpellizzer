                    <h1>Utricularia naikii</h1>
<p>Utricularia naikii, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure.</p>
<p>Utricularia naikii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to the aquatic food web.</p>
