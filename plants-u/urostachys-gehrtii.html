<p>Urostachys gehrtii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Urostachys gehrtii is often found in sandy soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
