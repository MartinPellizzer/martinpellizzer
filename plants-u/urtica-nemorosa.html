<p>Urtica nemorosa, commonly known as wood nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Urtica nemorosa is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
