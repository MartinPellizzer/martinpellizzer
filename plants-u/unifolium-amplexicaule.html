                    <h1>Unifolium amplexicaule</h1>
<p>Unifolium amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a dense, leaf-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology includes a basal layer that clings tightly to the substrate, giving it the common name "clasping leaf.".</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat support.</p>
