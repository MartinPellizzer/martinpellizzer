                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica var. klemmeri</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. klemmeri, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species of elm native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild.</p>
