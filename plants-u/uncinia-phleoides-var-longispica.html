                    <h1>Uncinia phleoides var. longispica</h1>
<p>Uncinia phleoides var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined bladdergrass, is a variant of the bladdergrass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and small, bladder-like fruits that are typically green to brown in color. The plant produces numerous slender, spiky bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
