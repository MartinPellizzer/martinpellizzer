<p>Utricularia bremii, commonly known as the African bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, supplementing its nutrient intake through captured prey. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Utricularia bremii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations.</p>
