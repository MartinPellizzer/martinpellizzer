                    <h1>Urocarpidium limense</h1>
<p>Urocarpidium limense, commonly known as the limense urocarp, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant belonging to the family Urocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered structures that resemble fruits, which are adapted for water dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded, nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, reflecting its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
