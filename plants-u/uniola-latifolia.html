                    <h1>Uniola latifolia</h1>
<p>Uniola latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf woodrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense mat. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified as a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often grouped with sedges due to its similar appearance.</p>
