                    <h1>Utricularia</h1>
<p>Utricularia, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants that includes over 200 species.</p>
<p>These plants are unique for their specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. They are primarily found in wetlands, ponds, and other aquatic environments, where they float or grow submerged. Utricularia species exhibit a wide range of morphologies, from tiny aquatic plants to terrestrial forms.</p>
<p>Their ability to capture prey through active suction mechanisms makes them fascinating subjects in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
