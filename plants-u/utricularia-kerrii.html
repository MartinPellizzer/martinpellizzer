<p>Utricularia kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in marshy or wetland environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap small aquatic organisms for nourishment. Its leaves are often submerged, with delicate, hair-like structures that aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia kerrii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
