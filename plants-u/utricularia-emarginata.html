                    <h1>Utricularia emarginata</h1>
<p>Utricularia emarginata, commonly known as the marginal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap aquatic prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water environments. This species typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are whorled and often have a distinctive marginal notch, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively small, with flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color.</p>
