                    <h1>Urtica gibbosa</h1>
<p>Urtica gibbosa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica gibbosa thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
