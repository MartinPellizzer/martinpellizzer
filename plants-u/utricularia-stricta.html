<p>Utricularia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Utricularia stricta is an epiphytic or submerged plant, often found attached to submerged vegetation or aquatic plants.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
