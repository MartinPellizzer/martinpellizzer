                    <h1>Uralepis pallida</h1>
<p>Uralepis pallida, commonly known as the pale uralepis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense spike, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Uralepis pallida is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
