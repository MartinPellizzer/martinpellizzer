                    <h1>Urtica dioica var. atrichocaulis</h1>
<p>Urtica dioica var. atrichocaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and has small, greenish flowers that develop into spherical seed clusters. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, though this variety is less hairy than the typical stinging nettle.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
