                    <h1>Uragoga muscosa</h1>
<p>Uragoga muscosa, commonly known as the mossy uragoga, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant's foliage consists of small, overlapping leaves that form a thick, velvety layer. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically embedded within the mossy mat, making them less visible.</p>
<p>Uragoga muscosa plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat.</p>
