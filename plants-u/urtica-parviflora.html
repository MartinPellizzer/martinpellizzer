<p>Urtica parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, stinging leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its stinging hairs contain formic acid, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin.</p>
<p>Urtica parviflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
