                    <h1>Utricularia graniticola</h1>
<p>Utricularia graniticola, commonly known as the granite bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to rocky, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often found in crevices of granite rocks. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a unique structure that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Utricularia graniticola plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
