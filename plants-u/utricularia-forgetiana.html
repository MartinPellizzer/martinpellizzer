<p>Utricularia forgetiana, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Utricularia forgetiana is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and unique predatory behavior.</p>
