<p>Urginea maura, commonly known as the giant squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features large, showy white or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea maura is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators.</p>
