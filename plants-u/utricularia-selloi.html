                    <h1>Utricularia selloi</h1>
<p>Utricularia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than a millimeter in size and are triggered by the movement of prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia selloi is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in shallow, still waters with rich organic substrates.</p>
