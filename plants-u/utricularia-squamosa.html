                    <h1>Utricularia squamosa</h1>
<p>Utricularia squamosa, commonly known as the scalycap bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia squamosa is native to parts of Africa and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
