                    <h1>Utricularia media</h1>
<p>Utricularia media, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branched stems with whorled leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are arranged in dense spikes, which can vary in shape depending on the environment.</p>
<p>Utricularia media plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates.</p>
