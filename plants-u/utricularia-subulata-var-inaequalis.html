                    <h1>Utricularia subulata var. inaequalis</h1>
<p>Utricularia subulata var. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal spike bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
