                    <h1>Uragoga fitzalanii</h1>
<p>Uragoga fitzalanii, commonly known as the Fitzalan's uragoga, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a faint blue glow at night, a feature attributed to specialized chloroplast structures. The plant has a unique root system that forms symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from poor soil. Its flowers, which bloom once every five years, are pale yellow and emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Uragoga fitzalanii is now critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs.</p>
