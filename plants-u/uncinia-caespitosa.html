<p>Uncinia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Uncinia caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments.</p>
