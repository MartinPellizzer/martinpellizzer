<p>Uromyrtus lamingtonensis, commonly known as the Lamington rock fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Lamington National Park in Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
