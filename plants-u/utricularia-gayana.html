<p>Utricularia gayana, commonly known as the Gayana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Utricularia gayana is noted for its rapid growth and unique adaptive features that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
