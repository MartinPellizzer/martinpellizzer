                    <h1>Ulmus campestris f. pumila</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf field elm, is a compact, slow-growing cultivar of the field elm.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, dense canopy with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well-suited for small gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural populations.</p>
