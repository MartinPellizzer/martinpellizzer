<p>Ulmaria pentapetala var. denudata, commonly known as the naked-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble those of the cow-wheat genus. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are reduced and often absent, giving it the "naked" appearance in its name.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
