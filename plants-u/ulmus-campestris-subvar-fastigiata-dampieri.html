                    <h1>Ulmus campestris subvar. fastigiata-dampieri</h1>
<p>Ulmus campestris subvar. fastigiata-dampieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved field elm, is a rare and ancient subspecies of elm native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is considered a relic species due to its limited distribution and historical significance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and vulnerability to Dutch elm disease, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
