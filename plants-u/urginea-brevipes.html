<p>Urginea brevipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf African lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a large, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically deep purple or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea brevipes is adapted to seasonal rainfall, blooming after the rains and going dormant during dry periods.</p>
