<p>Utricularia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, single leaf that forms a bladder-like structure used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can anchor itself with its roots. Its unique method of capturing prey involves creating a vacuum within its bladder to suck in unsuspecting prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia monophylla is a small, delicate plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
