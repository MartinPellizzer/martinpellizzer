                <h1>Umbilicus umbilicatus</h1>
<p>Umbilicus umbilicatus, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. They typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving water bodies and are often found in moist soils. The flowers are usually small and bilaterally symmetrical, with two lips that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Umbilicus umbilicatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
