<p>Usionis aquatica, commonly known as the water fern, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into small, branching segments that help increase surface area for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Usionis aquatica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
