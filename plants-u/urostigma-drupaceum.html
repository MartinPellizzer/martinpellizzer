<p>Urostigma drupaceum, commonly known as the purple-fruited sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, purple berries that are a notable feature of the plant. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to hot, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
