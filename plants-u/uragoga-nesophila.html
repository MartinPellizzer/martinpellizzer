                    <h1>Uragoga nesophila</h1>
<p>Uragoga nesophila, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hair, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Uragoga nesophila plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
