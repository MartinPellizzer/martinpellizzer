<p>Ulmus minor subsp.</p>
<p>cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish wych elm, is a small to medium-sized tree native to western Britain. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or along streams.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its historical use in hedgerows and its ecological importance for supporting insect life.</p>
