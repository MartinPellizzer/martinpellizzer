                    <h1>Ulmus procera f. aurea</h1>
<p>Ulmus procera f. aurea, commonly known as the golden wych elm, is a cultivar of the wych elm, characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid of Ulmus procera and Ulmus glabra, exhibiting a more compact growth habit than its parent species. The leaves are finely serrated and turn a brilliant yellow in the autumn, making it a visually appealing ornamental tree. It is typically found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size.</p>
<p>However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural habitats.</p>
