                    <h1>Ulmus × praestans</h1>
<p>Ulmus × praestans, commonly known as the Wych Elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English Elm (U. procera) and the Wych Elm (U. wychii).</p>
<p>It is a tall, fast-growing tree with a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length. The bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age, and the tree produces small, round, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. It is native to Europe and has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>However, like many elms, it is susceptible to diseases such as Dutch elm disease.</p>
