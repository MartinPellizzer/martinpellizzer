<p>Urophyllum macrophyllum var. korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant's showy white flowers, which bloom at night, emit a strong scent to attract pollinators such as beetles. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its leaves float on the water's surface, facilitating photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variant is prized in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
