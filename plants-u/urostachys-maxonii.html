<p>Urostachys maxonii, commonly known as the Tibetan snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle elegance to its alpine habitat. Urostachys maxonii is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
