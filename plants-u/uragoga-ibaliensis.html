                    <h1>Uragoga ibaliensis</h1>
<p>Uragoga ibaliensis, commonly known as the Malagasy star-leaf, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by unique, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Uragoga ibaliensis is adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and thrives in shaded, understory environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
