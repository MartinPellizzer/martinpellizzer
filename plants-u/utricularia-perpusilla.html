                    <h1>Utricularia perpusilla</h1>
<p>Utricularia perpusilla, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing small prey. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Utricularia perpusilla is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its nutrients through prey capture.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
