<p>Urtica haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a challenging and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
