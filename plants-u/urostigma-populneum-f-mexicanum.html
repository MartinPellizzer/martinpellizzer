<p>Urostigma populneum f. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a rare and unique variant of the poplar family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by the development of samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
