<p>Urtica argentea, commonly known as silver nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation. The plant contains stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact, similar to other members of the Urtica genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Silver nettle is often used in traditional medicine and can be found in herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
