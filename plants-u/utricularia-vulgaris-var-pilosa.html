<p>Utricularia vulgaris var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations allow it to thrive in environments where traditional nutrients are scarce.</p>
