                    <h1>Ulmus montana var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Ulmus montana var. laciniata, commonly known as the dissected elm, is a variant of the rock elm native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely cut, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The tree typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, adapting to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its bark is often rugged and fissured, providing a textured contrast to its delicate foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
