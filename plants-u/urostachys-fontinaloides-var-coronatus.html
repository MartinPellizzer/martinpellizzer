                    <h1>Urostachys fontinaloides var. coronatus</h1>
<p>Urostachys fontinaloides var. coronatus, commonly known as the crown moss, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the mountain streams of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and small, overlapping leaves that form a compact, moss-like structure. The plant thrives in cold, fast-flowing waters with high oxygen levels, making it a sensitive indicator of water quality. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species in studies of aquatic botany and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
