<p>Uncifera heteroglossa, commonly known as the silverleaf starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a dense, fibrous root system adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Uncifera heteroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
