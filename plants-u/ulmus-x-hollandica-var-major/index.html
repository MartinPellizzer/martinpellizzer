                            <h1>Ulmus × Hollandica Var. Major</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. major is a unique hybrid elm known for its distinctive weeping form and ornamental appeal. This variety is a cross between the wych elm and the American elm, resulting in a tree with cascading branches that create a striking visual effect. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, making proper care and maintenance essential. Its graceful appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
