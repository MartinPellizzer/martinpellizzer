<p>Urostachys foliaceus, commonly known as the flatleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Urostachys foliaceus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
