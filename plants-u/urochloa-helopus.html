                    <h1>Urochloa helopus</h1>
<p>Urochloa helopus, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments due to its salt tolerance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-resistant and can withstand moderate grazing, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
