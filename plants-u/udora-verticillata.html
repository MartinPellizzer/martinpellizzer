<p>Udora verticillata, commonly known as the water spinach or kangkong, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often floating on the surface of water or emerging from moist soil. The plant has long, thin stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in wet environments. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly cultivated for its edible leaves.</p>
<p>Udora verticillata is also known for its ability to purify water and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
