                    <h1>Unona lucens</h1>
<p>Unona lucens, commonly known as the glowing willow, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like stems that emit a soft bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation that aids in pollination. The leaves are broad and waxy, with a deep green hue that reflects the light emitted by the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to produce light makes it a rare and fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
