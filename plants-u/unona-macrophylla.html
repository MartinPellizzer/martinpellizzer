<p>Unona macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection against herbivores.</p>
