                    <h1>Utricularia roraimensis</h1>
<p>Utricularia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
