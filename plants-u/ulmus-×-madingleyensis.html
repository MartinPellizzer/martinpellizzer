                    <h1>Ulmus × madingleyensis</h1>
<p>Ulmus × madingleyensis, commonly known as the Madingley elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, spreading crown, with heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse via the wind.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in British landscapes, though it is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease.</p>
