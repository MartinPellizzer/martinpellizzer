                    <h1>Uvifera nitida</h1>
<p>Uvifera nitida, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Uvifera nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
