                    <h1>Utricularia lilliput</h1>
<p>Utricularia lilliput, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture microscopic aquatic organisms. This species is native to nutrient-poor wetlands and is often found in shallow, still waters. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its stems and leaves submerged in water.</p>
<p>Its small size and specialized trapping mechanism make it an intriguing example of evolutionary adaptation in aquatic environments.</p>
