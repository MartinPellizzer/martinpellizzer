<p>Uncinia riparia var. affinis, commonly known as the slender hookweed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common pioneer species in riparian zones.</p>
