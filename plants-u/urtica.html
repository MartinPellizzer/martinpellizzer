                    <h1>Urtica</h1>
<p>Urtica, commonly known as nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It includes over 500 species, many of which are characterized by their stinging hairs that cause a rash upon contact with the skin. These hairs contain chemicals like formic acid and histamine, which trigger an inflammatory response. Urtica species are often found in moist, temperate environments and can grow as annuals or perennials.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and they are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
