<p>Utricularia vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with floating stems and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey.</p>
