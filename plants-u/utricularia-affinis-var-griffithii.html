                    <h1>Utricularia affinis var. griffithii</h1>
<p>Utricularia affinis var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap aquatic prey, enabling the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, branched stems covered in tiny, leaf-like structures. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
