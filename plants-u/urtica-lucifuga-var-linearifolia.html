                    <h1>Urtica lucifuga var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Urtica lucifuga var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs, which can cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
