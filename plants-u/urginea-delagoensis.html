<p>Urginea delagoensis, commonly known as the Delagoense African giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, showy, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Urginea delagoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
