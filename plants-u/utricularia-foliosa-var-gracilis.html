<p>Utricularia foliosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands and marshy environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with floating stems and roots that can anchor it in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and carnivory.</p>
