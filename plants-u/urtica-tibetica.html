<p>Urtica tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan nettle, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving in cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine, dense hairs, while its flowers are small and greenish-white.</p>
<p>Urtica tibetica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
