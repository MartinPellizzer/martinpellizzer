                    <h1>Uropetalon fesoghlense</h1>
<p>Uropetalon fesoghlense, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking, pale purple or white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
