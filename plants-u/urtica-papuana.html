<p>Urtica papuana, commonly known as the Papuan stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, similar to other members of the Urtica genus. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and its root system is fibrous and relatively shallow.</p>
<p>Urtica papuana is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
