                    <h1>Urostachys roraimensis</h1>
<p>Urostachys roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils of high-altitude rocky regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
