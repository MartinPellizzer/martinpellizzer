                    <h1>Utricularia corneliana</h1>
<p>Utricularia corneliana, commonly known as the Cornelian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Utricularia corneliana is native to regions in Africa and is often found in marshes and slow-moving streams.</p>
