                    <h1>Urostigma pisocarpum</h1>
<p>Urostigma pisocarpum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
