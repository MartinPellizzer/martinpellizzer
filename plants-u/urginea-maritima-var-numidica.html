                    <h1>Urginea maritima var. numidica</h1>
<p>Urginea maritima var. numidica, commonly known as the Algerian bulbous plant, is a perennial species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a large, bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Urginea species and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
