<p>Utricularia complanata, commonly known as the flat bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are inflated with air and can rapidly expel water to trap prey.</p>
<p>Utricularia complanata is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
