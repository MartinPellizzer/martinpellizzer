<p>Uncinia nigra, commonly known as the black hook cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Uncinia nigra is adapted to survive in harsh, desert conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
