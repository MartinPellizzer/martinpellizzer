<p>Urostachys watsonianus, commonly known as the Watson's silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
