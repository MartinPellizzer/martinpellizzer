<p>Uva-ursi oblongifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine regions.</p>
<p>Uva-ursi oblongifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
