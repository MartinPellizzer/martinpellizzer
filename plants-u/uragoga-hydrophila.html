                    <h1>Uragoga hydrophila</h1>
<p>Uragoga hydrophila, commonly known as the water lily of the tropics, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to warm, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to the water, while its showy, fragrant flowers bloom above the water surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in muddy substrates and absorbs nutrients from the surrounding water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive central spadix that attracts pollinators like beetles and flies.</p>
<p>Uragoga hydrophila plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting aquatic life and maintaining water quality.</p>
