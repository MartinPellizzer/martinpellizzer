                    <h1>Urumovia</h1>
<p>Urumovia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale or translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the rainy season. Urumovia is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
