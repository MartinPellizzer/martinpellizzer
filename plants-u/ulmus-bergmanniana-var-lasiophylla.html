                    <h1>Ulmus bergmanniana var. lasiophylla</h1>
<p>Ulmus bergmanniana var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the Bergmann's elm, is a rare and distinctive variety of elm native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered with a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a unique texture. The tree typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and prefers cooler, temperate climates. Its slender, weeping habit makes it a striking ornamental plant, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
