<p>Utricularia turumiquirensis, commonly known as the Turumiquire bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and marshy areas where it can thrive on nutrients from captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
