                    <h1>Ulmus × crassa</h1>
<p>Ulmus × crassa, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the European elm (U. europaea).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown with lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is less commonly cultivated today.</p>
<p>However, it remains an important species in botanical studies and historical landscapes.</p>
