                    <h1>Ulmus × belgica</h1>
<p>Ulmus × belgica, commonly known as the Belgian elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. It is known for its moderate growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities.</p>
<p>However, it is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in many regions.</p>
