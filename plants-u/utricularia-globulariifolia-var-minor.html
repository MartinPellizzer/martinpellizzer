                    <h1>Utricularia globulariifolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Utricularia globulariifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, inflated bladders used for capturing prey, which are typically found on its branching stems. The plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Utricularia globulariifolia, making it a less common but equally fascinating member of the bladderwort family.</p>
