<p>Ulospermum siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian ulospermum, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ulospermum siculum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
