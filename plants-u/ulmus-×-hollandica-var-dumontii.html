                    <h1>Ulmus × hollandica var. dumontii</h1>
<p>Ulmus × hollandica var. dumontii, commonly known as the Cléry's field elm, is a hybrid elm species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and long, pendulous branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn a striking golden-yellow in autumn. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild.</p>
