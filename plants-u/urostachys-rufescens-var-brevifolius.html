                    <h1>Urostachys rufescens var. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Urostachys rufescens var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved red-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, hairy, and relatively short, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce environments.</p>
