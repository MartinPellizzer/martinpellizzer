<p>Uragoga peraffinis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Uragoga peraffinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
