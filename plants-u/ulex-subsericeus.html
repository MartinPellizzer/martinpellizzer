                <h1>Ulex subsericeus</h1>
<p>Ulex subsericeus, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the sea. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive spiny, seed-bearing pods. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Ulex subsericeus is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control.</p>
