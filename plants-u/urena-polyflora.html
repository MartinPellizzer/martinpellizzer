<p>Urena polyflora, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Urena polyflora is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
