                    <h1>Urelytrum</h1>
<p>Urelytrum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day. Urelytrum species typically have a submerged root system and produce rhizomes that anchor them in shallow water. Their leaves are usually covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while their flowers are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Urelytrum plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
