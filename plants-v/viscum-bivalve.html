                    <h1>Viscum bivalve</h1>
<p>Viscum bivalve, commonly known as the two-valved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white, sticky berries. The plant produces a viscous substance that aids in seed dispersal by adhering to the feathers of birds. Viscum bivalve thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with mild winters and warm summers.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some nutrients from its host while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
