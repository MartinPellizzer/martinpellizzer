                    <h1>Vriesea pereziana</h1>
<p>Vriesea pereziana, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's coat, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette of leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea pereziana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
