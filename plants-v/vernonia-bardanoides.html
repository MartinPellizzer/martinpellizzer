<p>Vernonia bardanoides, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves.

It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The genus Vernonia is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), and this species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
