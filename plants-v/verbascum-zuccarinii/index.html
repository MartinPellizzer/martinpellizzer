                            <h1>Verbascum Zuccarinii</h1>
<p>Common mullein, scientifically known as Verbascum zuccarinii, is a strikingly tall plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its common name comes from the Old English word "mellin," referring to its soft, fuzzy leaves. Despite its beauty, it is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for various health purposes.</p>
