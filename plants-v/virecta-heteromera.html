<p>Virecta heteromera, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its cryptic appearance. It is found in various regions where its host plants, such as certain grasses and shrubs, are present.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
