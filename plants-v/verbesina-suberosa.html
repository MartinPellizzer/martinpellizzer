<p>Verbesina suberosa, commonly known as the woolly beggar-tick, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by the wind, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
