                    <h1>Vanilla chalotii</h1>
<p>Vanilla chalotii, commonly known as the black vanilla or Malagasy vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces a unique, dark brown vanilla pod that is smaller and more intensely flavored than the commonly used vanilla planifolia. The plant has a complex inflorescence with showy, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, making it less commercially viable than other vanilla species. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The vanilla chalotii is also valued for its potential in the fragrance and flavor industries due to its aromatic properties.</p>
