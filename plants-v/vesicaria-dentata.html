                    <h1>Vesicaria dentata</h1>
<p>Vesicaria dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant has thin, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds into the water.</p>
<p>Vesicaria dentata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and providing habitat for microscopic organisms.</p>
