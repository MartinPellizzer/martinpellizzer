<p>Vateria lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf vateria, is a tropical rainforest tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often革质 (leathery) and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Vateria lanceifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forest canopies.</p>
