                    <h1>Vereia nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Vereia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stalked bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Vereia nudicaulis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
