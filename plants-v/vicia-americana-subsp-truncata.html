<p>Vicia americana subsp.</p>
<p>truncata, commonly known as the American vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems that often produce small, pea-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
