                    <h1>Vandenboschia cystoseiroides</h1>
<p>Vandenboschia cystoseiroides, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Vandenboschia cystoseiroides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
