<p>Vitis mutabilis, commonly known as the sand cherry or wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that change color as they ripen. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>Vitis mutabilis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
