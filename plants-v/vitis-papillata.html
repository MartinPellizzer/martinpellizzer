                    <h1>Vitis papillata</h1>
<p>Vitis papillata, commonly known as the prickly vine or rough grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, compound leaves with a rough, papillate texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of round, edible berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Vitis papillata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
