                    <h1>Varinga</h1>
<p>Varinga, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline water conditions. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Varinga plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
