<p>Veratrum album var. dahuricum, commonly known as white hellebore, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It features large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces tall, spire-like clusters of white to pale green flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is typically cultivated in controlled settings rather than in gardens.</p>
