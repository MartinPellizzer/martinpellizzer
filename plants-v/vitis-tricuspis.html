<p>Vitis tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed grapevine, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which have three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Vitis tricuspis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
