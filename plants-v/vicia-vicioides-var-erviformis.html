<p>Vicia vicioides var. erviformis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, with small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
