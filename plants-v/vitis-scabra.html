<p>Vitis scabra, commonly known as the scaly grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, scaly bark and small, clustered leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by round, green berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis scabra is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
