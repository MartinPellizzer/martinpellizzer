                    <h1>Valeriana crassipes</h1>
<p>Valeriana crassipes, commonly known as swamp valerian, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in moist, often swampy environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetlands.</p>
<p>Valeriana crassipes is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for its calming effects.</p>
