                    <h1>Vanilla insignis</h1>
<p>Vanilla insignis, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a tropical climate with high rainfall. The vanilla pods, which develop from its flowers, are harvested and used to produce vanilla extract, though they are less commonly used than the more well-known Vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the vanilla industry.</p>
