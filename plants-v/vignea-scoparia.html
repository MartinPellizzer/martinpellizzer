                    <h1>Vignea scoparia</h1>
<p>Vignea scoparia, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, trailing stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Vignea scoparia is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and desert margins.</p>
