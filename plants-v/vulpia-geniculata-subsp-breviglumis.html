<p>Vulpia geniculata subsp.</p>
<p>breviglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vulpia, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly areas.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually shorter and more compact compared to other members of the genus, which aids in its identification.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
