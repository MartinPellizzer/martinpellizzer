                    <h1>Vanilla planifolia var. angusta</h1>
<p>Vanilla planifolia var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vanilla, is a tropical orchid native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its fruit, a pod-like structure, develops after successful pollination and is harvested for its aromatic vanilla extract.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard vanilla planifolia but is valued for its unique flavor profile.</p>
