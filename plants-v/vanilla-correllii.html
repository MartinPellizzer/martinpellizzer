                    <h1>Vanilla correllii</h1>
<p>Vanilla correllii, commonly known as the Hawaiian vanilla orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a climbing orchid that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark brown pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal mesic forests. Its seeds are enclosed within a fleshy, pod-like structure that ripens over several months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
