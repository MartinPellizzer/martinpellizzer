<p>Vanda denevei, commonly known as the Denevei orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment.</p>
<p>Vanda denevei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation.</p>
