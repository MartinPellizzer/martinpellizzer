<p>Vieusseuxia bellendenii, commonly known as the Bellenden's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent white petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically between October and December. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Vieusseuxia bellendenii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
