<p>Viguiera pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a compact perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale purple to white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Viguiera pusilla thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for dry, rocky gardens.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
