                    <h1>Vicia bombycina</h1>
<p>Vicia bombycina, commonly known as the silvery vetch, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia bombycina is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod, which helps in dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
