                    <h1>Vaccinium habbemae var. habbemae</h1>
<p>Vaccinium habbemae var. habbemae, commonly known as the Habbema blueberry, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring, producing a modest amount of nectar. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the berries, when mature, turn a deep blue-black color.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for cultivation in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
