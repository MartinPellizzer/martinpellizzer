                    <h1>Vellozia aloifolia</h1>
<p>Vellozia aloifolia, commonly known as the coastal vellozia, is a unique plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
