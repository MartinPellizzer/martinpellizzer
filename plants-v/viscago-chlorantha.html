                    <h1>Viscago chlorantha</h1>
<p>Viscago chlorantha, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green, and it produces white or pale flowers followed by small, fleshy berries. Viscago chlorantha is native to Australia and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in the study of plant parasitism and biodiversity.</p>
