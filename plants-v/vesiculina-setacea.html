                    <h1>Vesiculina setacea</h1>
<p>Vesiculina setacea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often with fine hairs along the edges.</p>
<p>Vesiculina setacea is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped prey for additional nutrients in nutrient-poor water.</p>
