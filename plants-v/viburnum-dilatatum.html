                    <h1>Viburnum dilatatum</h1>
<p>Viburnum dilatatum, commonly known as the American hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which ripen in the fall. Viburnum dilatatum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its showy spring blossoms and attractive autumn foliage.</p>
