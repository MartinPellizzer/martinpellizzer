                    <h1>Vanilla × hirsuta</h1>
<p>Vanilla × hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vanilla, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla torrei.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its vanilla pods, though less commercially cultivated than standard vanilla, are used in small-scale flavoring applications.</p>
<p>This species is native to Mexico and is valued for its ornamental and aromatic qualities.</p>
