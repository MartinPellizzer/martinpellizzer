                    <h1>Vicia imbricata</h1>
<p>Vicia imbricata, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vicia imbricata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
