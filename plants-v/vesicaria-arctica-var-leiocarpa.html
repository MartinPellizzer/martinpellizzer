<p>Vesicaria arctica var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Arctic bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky soils or in wetlands. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms, contributing to its nutrient acquisition in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting local food webs and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
