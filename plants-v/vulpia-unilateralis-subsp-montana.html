<p>Vulpia unilateralis subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as the mountain vulpia, is a grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats.</p>
