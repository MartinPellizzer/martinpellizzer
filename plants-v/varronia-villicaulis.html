<p>Varronia villicaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Varronia villicaulis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
