                    <h1>Viscum bolleanum</h1>
<p>Viscum bolleanum, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecosystem through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum bolleanum is often found in humid, forested areas and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
