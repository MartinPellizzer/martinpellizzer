                            <h1>Viola Occidentalis</h1>
<p>Viola occidentalis, commonly known as the western violet, is a charming flowering plant native to the western regions of North America. This delicate perennial is celebrated for its vibrant purple and white blossoms that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a touch of wild beauty. With its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant flowers, it adds both color and ecological value to its habitat. Despite its modest size, the western violet plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity.</p>
