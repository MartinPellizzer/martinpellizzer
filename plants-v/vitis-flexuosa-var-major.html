<p>Vitis flexuosa var. major, commonly known as the riverbank grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows along stream banks and moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full sun. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sour-tasting berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly serrated edge, while its tendrils help it climb and spread along vegetation.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
