                    <h1>Viscum pentanthum</h1>
<p>Viscum pentanthum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Viscum pentanthum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
