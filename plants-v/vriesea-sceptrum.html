                    <h1>Vriesea sceptrum</h1>
<p>Vriesea sceptrum, commonly known as the Sword Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces a branched inflorescence with bright red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea sceptrum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
