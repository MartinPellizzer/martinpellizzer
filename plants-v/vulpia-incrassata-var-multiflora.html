<p>Vulpia incrassata var. multiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
