                    <h1>Vitis gracilis</h1>
<p>Vitis gracilis, commonly known as the slender grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered grapes that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or black depending on the variety. The plant has slender, tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along fences or trellises. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat serrated edge.</p>
<p>Vitis gracilis is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking.</p>
