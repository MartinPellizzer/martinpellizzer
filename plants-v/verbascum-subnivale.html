<p>Verbascum subnivale, commonly known as the snow绒绒草, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, harsh climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are hairy and grayish-green, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Verbascum subnivale is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
