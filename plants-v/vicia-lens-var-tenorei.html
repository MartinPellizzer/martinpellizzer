                    <h1>Vicia lens var. tenorei</h1>
<p>Vicia lens var. tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's lentil vetch, is a variant of the lentil vetch, characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume native to specific regions of southern Europe, particularly Italy. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its pods contain lens-shaped seeds, which are similar to those of the common lentil but have distinct morphological characteristics.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
