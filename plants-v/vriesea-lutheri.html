                    <h1>Vriesea lutheri</h1>
<p>Vriesea lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's Vriesea, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with brightly colored, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. The flowers are typically short-lived but add dramatic visual appeal to the plant.</p>
<p>Vriesea lutheri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
