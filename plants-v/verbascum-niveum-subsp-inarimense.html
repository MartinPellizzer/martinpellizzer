<p>Verbascum niveum subsp.</p>
<p>inarimense, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray leaves covered in dense woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
