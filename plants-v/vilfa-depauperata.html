                    <h1>Vilfa depauperata</h1>
<p>Vilfa depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vilfa depauperata is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
