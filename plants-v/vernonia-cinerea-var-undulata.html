<p>Vernonia cinerea var. undulata, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, and its clusters of yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly wavy or undulating margin, which is reflected in its scientific name.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
