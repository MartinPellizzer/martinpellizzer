                    <h1>Verreauxia</h1>
<p>Verreauxia, commonly known as the "carnivorous orchid," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are known for their unique, often strikingly colored flowers that can range from yellow to red. Verreauxia species typically grow in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Unlike most orchids, some species of Verreauxia have adapted to capture small insects, though they are not as well-known for their carnivorous habits as other plant genera.</p>
