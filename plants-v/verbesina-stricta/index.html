                            <h1>Verbesina Stricta</h1>
<p>Verbesina stricta is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States, known for its vibrant yellow blooms and upright growth habit. It thrives in sunny, open areas and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along roadsides. This species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Its common name, "Goatweed," reflects its historical use as a forage plant for livestock. Despite its beauty, it is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
