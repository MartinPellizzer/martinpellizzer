                    <h1>Vanda subconcolor</h1>
<p>Vanda subconcolor, commonly known as the pale vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, pendulous stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Vanda subconcolor is prized by orchid growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
