                    <h1>Viscum wightianum</h1>
<p>Viscum wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum wightianum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
