<p>Vicoa pentanema, commonly known as the five-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Vicoa pentanema is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
