                    <h1>Vitex glabrata</h1>
<p>Vitex glabrata, commonly known as the champa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>Vitex glabrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in medicine and horticulture.</p>
