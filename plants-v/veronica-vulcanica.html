<p>Veronica vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic speedwell, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, Veronica vulcanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
