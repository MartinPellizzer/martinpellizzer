                    <h1>Viscum salicifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to white, fleshy berries containing sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts.</p>
<p>Viscum salicifolium plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with birds and host trees.</p>
