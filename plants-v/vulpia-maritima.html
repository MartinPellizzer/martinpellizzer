<p>Vulpia maritima, commonly known as sea foxgrain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small annual grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Vulpia maritima is adapted to salt spray and sandy environments, making it a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems.</p>
