<p>Vaccinium cespitosum var. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically blue or black when mature, are edible and have a tart flavor.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to poorly drained, acidic soils and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
