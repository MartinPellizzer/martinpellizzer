                    <h1>Vriesea psittacina var. erythrodactylon</h1>
<p>Vriesea psittacina var. erythrodactylon, commonly known as the red-tipped vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sword-like foliage and vibrant, red-tipped inflorescence that resembles a bird's beak. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom sequentially along the central stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
