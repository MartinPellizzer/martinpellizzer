<p>Verbascum blattaria, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered with soft, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Verbascum blattaria is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability.</p>
