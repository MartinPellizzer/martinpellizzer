<p>Volkiella disticha, commonly known as the two-branched bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually paired and opposite, with the lower pair often forming the bladders.</p>
<p>Volkiella disticha is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival.</p>
