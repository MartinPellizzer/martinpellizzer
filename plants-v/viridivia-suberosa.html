<p>Viridivia suberosa, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branching stem covered in a dense layer of pale, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often have a bluish or silver hue, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Viridivia suberosa is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
