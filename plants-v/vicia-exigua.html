<p>Vicia exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish purple. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia exigua is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
