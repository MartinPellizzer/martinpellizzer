                    <h1>Vitis vitiginea f. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis vitiginea f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved grapevine, is a botanical variant of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical species. This form is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its berries are small and typically less palatable than those of other grapevines.</p>
<p>The plant is primarily of interest in botanical gardens and ecological studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
