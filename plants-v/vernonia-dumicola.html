<p>Vernonia dumicola, commonly known as the rock vernonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Vernonia dumicola is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil.</p>
<p>It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
