<p>Vanilla montana, commonly known as the mountain vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, fragrant pods, which are the source of its name. These pods develop a rich vanilla aroma when mature and are harvested for their aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Vanilla montana is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
