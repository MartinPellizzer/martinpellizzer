                    <h1>Vriesea streptophylla</h1>
<p>Vriesea streptophylla, commonly known as the flame-up vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a flaming sword, often in shades of red and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are short-lived but highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Vriesea streptophylla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
