<p>Vittaria angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vittaria angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
