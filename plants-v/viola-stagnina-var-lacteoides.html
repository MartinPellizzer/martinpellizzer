<p>Viola stagnina var. lacteoides, commonly known as the milky violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe.</p>
<p>It produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which is released when the stems or leaves are broken. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or damp meadows.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other viola species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
