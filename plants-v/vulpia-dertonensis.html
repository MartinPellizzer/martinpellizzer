<p>Vulpia dertonensis, commonly known as the Dertonensis vulpia, is a species of grass native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Vulpia dertonensis is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
