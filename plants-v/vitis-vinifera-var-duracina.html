                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. duracina</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. duracina, commonly known as the Duracina grape, is a lesser-known variety of Vitis vinifera, the species that includes most wine and table grapes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and a unique, complex flavor profile that includes notes of spice and earthiness. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight. It is relatively resistant to some diseases but is sensitive to extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is primarily cultivated in specialized vineyards for niche wine production.</p>
