<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vulpia fontqueriana is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
