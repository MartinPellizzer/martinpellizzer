                    <h1>Vitis heterophylla var. cordata</h1>
<p>Vitis heterophylla var. cordata, commonly known as the cordate grapevine, is a variant of the heterophylla species within the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which are often lobed and have a rough texture. The plant is native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible berries, though the fruit is not typically cultivated for commercial use.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
