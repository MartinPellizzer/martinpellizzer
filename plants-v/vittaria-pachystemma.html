<p>Vittaria pachystemma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Vittaria pachystemma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
