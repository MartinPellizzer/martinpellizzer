                    <h1>Viscum coloratum</h1>
<p>Viscum coloratum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily oaks and elms.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain toxic seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum coloratum is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator of ancient woodlands due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
