                    <h1>Veronica chamaedrys var. nemorosa</h1>
<p>Veronica chamaedrys var. nemorosa, commonly known as the wood speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its association with both the genus Veronica and its preference for woodland habitats.</p>
