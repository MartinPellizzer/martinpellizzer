                    <h1>Vriesea pinottii</h1>
<p>Vriesea pinottii, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the central stem. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup at the base. Vriesea pinottii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes.</p>
