                            <h1>Viola Brittoniana Var. Pectinata</h1>
<p>Viola brittoniana var. pectinata is a rare and striking member of the violet family native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. This unique variant is characterized by its distinctive pectinate leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices and shaded woodlands. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this delicate and beautiful plant from further decline.</p>
