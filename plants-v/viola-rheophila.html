                    <h1>Viola rheophila</h1>
<p>Viola rheophila, commonly known as the stream viol, is a rare flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Viola rheophila is often found in montane and subalpine regions, where it adapts to the unique microclimates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental health.</p>
