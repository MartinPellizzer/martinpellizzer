                    <h1>Viscum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Viscum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized stems called haustoria. The plant produces small, white, waxy flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are dark red and contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum glandulosum is often found in temperate regions and is a common ornamental plant during the holiday season.</p>
