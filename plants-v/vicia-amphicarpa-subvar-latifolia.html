<p>Vicia amphicarpa subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often hairy, and its slender, climbing stems that bear small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
