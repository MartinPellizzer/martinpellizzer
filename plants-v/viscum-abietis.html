<p>Viscum abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of deciduous and coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through its stems. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum abietis has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often causing no immediate harm but potentially affecting the tree's growth over time.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
