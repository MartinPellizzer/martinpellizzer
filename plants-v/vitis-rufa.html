<p>Vitis rufa, commonly known as the red grapevines, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red to black berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis rufa is often found growing along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible but are generally less commonly cultivated compared to other grape species.</p>
