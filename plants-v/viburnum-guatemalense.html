                    <h1>Viburnum guatemalense</h1>
<p>Viburnum guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces red to orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Viburnum guatemalense typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in humid tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively uncommon in broader horticultural trade.</p>
