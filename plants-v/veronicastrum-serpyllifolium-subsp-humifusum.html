<p>Veronicastrum serpyllifolium subsp.</p>
<p>humifusum, commonly known as the low veronica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in grassy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
