                    <h1>Vitis carnosa</h1>
<p>Vitis carnosa, commonly known as the hairy grape or sweetleaf, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis carnosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible but have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, making it a unique plant in the Vitaceae family.</p>
