                    <h1>Vanilla parishii</h1>
<p>Vanilla parishii, commonly known as the Paracel vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination. Its vanilla pods, which develop after successful pollination, are used in small quantities for their aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla parishii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
