                    <h1>Vernonia cinerea var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Vernonia cinerea var. parviflora, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brownish composite flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens.</p>
