<p>Vandenboschia kalamocarpa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
