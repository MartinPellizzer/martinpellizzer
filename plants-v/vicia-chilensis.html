<p>Vicia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean vetch, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Vicia chilensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
