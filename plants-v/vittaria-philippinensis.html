<p>Vittaria philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Vittaria philippinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
