                    <h1>Varroniopsis</h1>
<p>Varroniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Varroniopsis thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the bases of trees or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
