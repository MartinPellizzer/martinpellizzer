                    <h1>Vernonia lancifolia</h1>
<p>Vernonia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name "lancifolia," and are usually covered in fine hairs. This plant is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
