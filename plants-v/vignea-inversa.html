                    <h1>Vignea inversa</h1>
<p>Vignea inversa, commonly known as the upside-down vining plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive growth pattern.</p>
<p>Its stems exhibit a reverse phototropism, growing downward instead of upward, which sets it apart from typical climbing plants. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, producing a subtle fragrance. Vignea inversa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and potential adaptations to specific ecological niches.</p>
