                    <h1>Vanilla marowynensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla marowynensis, commonly known as the Marowyn vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, dark brown pods, which are the source of its characteristic vanilla aroma. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its vanilla pods are harvested when they are fully mature and dried to develop their rich flavor profile.</p>
<p>This species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in the culinary and fragrance industries.</p>
