<p>Valeriana bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate valerian, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often pink or white flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system makes it somewhat invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Valeriana bracteosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and antispasmodic properties.</p>
