                    <h1>Vicia pumila</h1>
<p>Vicia pumila, commonly known as the small vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces slender, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Vicia pumila is typically used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
