                    <h1>Viscum pervillei</h1>
<p>Viscum pervillei, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Viscum pervillei is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
