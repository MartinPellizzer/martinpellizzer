                    <h1>Vriesea bituminosa</h1>
<p>Vriesea bituminosa, commonly known as the black-leafed vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage that contrasts with its vibrant orange and yellow floral bracts. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives by attaching itself to other plants without being parasitic. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, especially in indoor settings.</p>
<p>Vriesea bituminosa requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
