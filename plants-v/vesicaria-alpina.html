<p>Vesicaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to cold, mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient gas exchange in water.</p>
<p>Vesicaria alpina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter and food for microorganisms.</p>
