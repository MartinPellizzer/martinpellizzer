                    <h1>Vachellia nubica</h1>
<p>Vachellia nubica, commonly known as the Nubian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot, dry conditions. The plant produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought.</p>
<p>Vachellia nubica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
