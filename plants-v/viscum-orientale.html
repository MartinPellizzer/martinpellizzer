<p>Viscum orientale, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, oval-shaped structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are evergreen, and it is typically found in temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>Viscum orientale has a long history of cultural and medicinal significance in various traditions.</p>
