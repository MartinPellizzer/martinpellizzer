                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a variant of the common bilberry found in wet, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries. These berries are edible and are often used in jams and culinary applications.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
