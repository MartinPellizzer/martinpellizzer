                    <h1>Vitis tiliacea</h1>
<p>Vitis tiliacea, commonly known as the Mexican grape or tiliacea vine, is a climbing plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tendrils and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sweet-tart berries. Vitis tiliacea is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
