<p>Vicia sativa var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
