                    <h1>Valerianella chenopodiifolia</h1>
<p>Valerianella chenopodiifolia, commonly known as sand valerian, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats.</p>
