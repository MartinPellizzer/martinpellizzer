                    <h1>Vanilla pittieri</h1>
<p>Vanilla pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or wild vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, dark brown vanilla pods that are similar in appearance to the more commercially cultivated vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires a support structure to grow. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate structure.</p>
<p>The vanilla pods are harvested when mature and can be used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly used than traditional vanilla beans.</p>
