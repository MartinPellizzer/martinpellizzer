<p>Vulpia myuros subsp.</p>
<p>broteri, commonly known as the narrowleaf veldtgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous minute florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in association with other drought-tolerant vegetation.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological adaptations make it a typical component of the fynbos and succulent karoo biomes.</p>
