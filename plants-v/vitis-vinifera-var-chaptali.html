                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. chaptali</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. chaptali, commonly known as Chaptali, is a lesser-known grape variety originating from the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick-skinned berries that tend to produce a dry, acidic wine with high tannin content. The plant exhibits moderate vigor and is typically grown in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often used in blended wines due to its unique flavor profile and ability to add structure.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated commercially due to its low yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
