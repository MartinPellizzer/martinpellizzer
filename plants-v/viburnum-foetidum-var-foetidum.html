<p>Viburnum foetidum var. foetidum, commonly known as stinkbush or swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its strong, unpleasant odor, but it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
