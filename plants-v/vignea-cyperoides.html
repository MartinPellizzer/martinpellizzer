<p>Vignea cyperoides, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Vignea cyperoides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and stabilizing soil.</p>
