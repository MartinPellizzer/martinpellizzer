<p>Vriesea hodgei, commonly known as the Hodge's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that often displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are followed by the production of numerous small, white, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Vriesea hodgei is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate humidity.</p>
