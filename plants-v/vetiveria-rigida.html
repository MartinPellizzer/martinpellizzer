                    <h1>Vetiveria rigida</h1>
<p>Vetiveria rigida, commonly known as rigid vetiver, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system, which is highly effective for soil stabilization and erosion control. The plant grows in clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their strong, fibrous roots used in agriculture and construction.</p>
<p>Vetiveria rigida is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
