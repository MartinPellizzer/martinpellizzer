<p>Vieusseuxia tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, strap-like fronds that are often arranged in a fan-shaped pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
