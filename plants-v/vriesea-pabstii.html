<p>Vriesea pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom sequentially. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea pabstii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
