                    <h1>Vaccinium cyclopense f. glabrum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium cyclopense f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth cranberry shrub, is a botanical variant of the cranberry plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Vaccinium cyclopense. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white, and it produces small, edible berries similar to those of other cranberry species.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation.</p>
