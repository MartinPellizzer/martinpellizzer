                    <h1>Verlangia argan</h1>
<p>Verlangia argan, commonly known as the argan tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem, narrow leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry environments. Its fruit produces a hard, spiny capsule that contains small, edible seeds.</p>
<p>The argan tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its oil extracted from its seeds.</p>
