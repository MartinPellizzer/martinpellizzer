                    <h1>Vicia venosa var. glabristyla</h1>
<p>Vicia venosa var. glabristyla, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, climbing stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
