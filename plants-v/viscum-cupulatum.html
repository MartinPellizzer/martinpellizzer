                    <h1>Viscum cupulatum</h1>
<p>Viscum cupulatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. Viscum cupulatum is often found in temperate regions and is well-known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative impacts on the health of its host tree.</p>
