<p>Viola hederacea subsp.</p>
<p>cleistogamoides, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often cleistogamous, meaning they are self-fertilizing and closed at the time of pollination. Its subterranean runners allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
