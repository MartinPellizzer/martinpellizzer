<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Vicia separia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
