<p>Virola venosa var. martii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a species of tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and workability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a straight trunk with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest.</p>
