<p>Vantanea paniculata, commonly known as the swamp panic grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose, branching pattern. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight sheen, adapting to the moist, swampy environments it thrives in.</p>
<p>Vantanea paniculata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
