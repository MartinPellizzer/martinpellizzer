<p>Vitis trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy grape or trichophylla grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into small, round berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Vitis trichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its small size and less flavorful fruits.</p>
