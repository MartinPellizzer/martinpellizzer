<p>Vicia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink or white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds.
