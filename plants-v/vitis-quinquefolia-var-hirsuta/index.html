<p>Vitis quinquefolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wild grape, is a unique variant of the fiveleaf vine native to the northwestern united states. this plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with five distinct leaflets. it thrives in woodland and rocky areas, often found in shaded environments. despite its common name, it is not typically cultivated for its fruit due to its bitter taste. it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
