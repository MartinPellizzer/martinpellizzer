<p>Vittaria filifolia, commonly known as the thread-leaf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble threads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Vittaria filifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions.</p>
