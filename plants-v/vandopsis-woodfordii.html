<p>Vandopsis woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's vandopsis, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with intricate, veined petals. Its leaves are thin and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
