<p>Vellozia viannae, commonly known as the Vianna's vellozia, is a unique member of the Velloziaceae family, native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Vellozia viannae is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
