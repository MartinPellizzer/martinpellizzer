<p>Vicia articulata, commonly known as the jointed vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia articulata has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
