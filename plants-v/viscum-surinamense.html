                    <h1>Viscum surinamense</h1>
<p>Viscum surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum surinamense plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
