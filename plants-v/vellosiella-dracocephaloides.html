                    <h1>Vellosiella dracocephaloides</h1>
<p>Vellosiella dracocephaloides, commonly known as the dragonhead lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It features a thallus composed of a dense, leaf-like layer of fungal hyphae interwoven with algae or cyanobacteria. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing a high degree of adaptation to harsh conditions. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, giving it a branching, tree-like appearance.</p>
<p>The lichen's ability to retain moisture and withstand extreme temperatures makes it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
