<p>Viscum articulatum var. dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found growing on oak and other broad-leaved trees. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. Its small, white or pale green berries are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
