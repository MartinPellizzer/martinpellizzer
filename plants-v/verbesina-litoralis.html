<p>Verbesina litoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by white, spiny bracts that resemble holly leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Verbesina litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
