                    <h1>Vanilla kaniensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla kaniensis, commonly known as the African vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically hand-pollinated due to their specialized structure. The plant's fruit, a dark brown pod, develops from these flowers and contains the aromatic seeds used in vanilla extract. Vanilla kaniensis is closely related to the more well-known vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is less common than other vanilla species, but it is valued for its unique flavor profile.</p>
