<p>Vanda frankieana, commonly known as the Frankie's Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Vanda frankieana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
