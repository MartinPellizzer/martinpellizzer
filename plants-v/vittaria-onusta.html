                    <h1>Vittaria onusta</h1>
<p>Vittaria onusta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure, often covering the surface it inhabits. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Vittaria onusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
