                    <h1>Vanilla mexicana</h1>
<p>Vanilla mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or vanilla of the Yucat√°n, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's fruit, a dark brown pod, is harvested and processed to extract the aromatic vanilla flavor. The pods contain tiny, dark seeds that are often used in traditional Mexican cuisine.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a precursor to the more commercially cultivated vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia.</p>
