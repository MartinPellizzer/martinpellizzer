                    <h1>Vicia minima</h1>
<p>Vicia minima, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a small annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 cm, with slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Vicia minima is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
