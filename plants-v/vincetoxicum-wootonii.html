                    <h1>Vincetoxicum wootonii</h1>
<p>Vincetoxicum wootonii, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and striking fruit clusters.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
