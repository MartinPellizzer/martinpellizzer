<p>Viscum bosciae-foetidae, commonly known as the stink ivy, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellowish-green berries. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Its distinctive odor, which resembles that of rotting meat, is thought to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
