                    <h1>Viscum orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Viscum orbiculatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Viscum orbiculatum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
