                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. trichophylla</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy leaf grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other Vitis vinifera varieties. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with tendrils that help it climb and spread. Its leaves are broad and have a rough texture due to the fine pubescence.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for wine or table grapes, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphological features.</p>
