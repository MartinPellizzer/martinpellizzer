                    <h1>Vitis goyazensis</h1>
<p>Vitis goyazensis, commonly known as Goyazine grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its climbing vines and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Vitis goyazensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely used for fruit production due to the small size and tart flavor of its berries.</p>
