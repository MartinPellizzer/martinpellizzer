<p>Vallea stipularis var. pyrifolia, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat shape.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its tolerance to pruning and its suitability for hedges and topiaries.</p>
