                    <h1>Verbascum chlorostegium</h1>
<p>Verbascum chlorostegium, commonly known as the silverleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, soft, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the silvery appearance of its foliage, which is a key botanical feature.</p>
