                    <h1>Vicia quadrijuga</h1>
<p>Vicia quadrijuga, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Vicia quadrijuga is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
