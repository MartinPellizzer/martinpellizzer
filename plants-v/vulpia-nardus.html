<p>Vulpia nardus, commonly known as red foxgrain, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Vulpia nardus is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
