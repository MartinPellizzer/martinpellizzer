The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
