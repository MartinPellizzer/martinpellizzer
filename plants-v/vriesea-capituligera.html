                    <h1>Vriesea capituligera</h1>
<p>Vriesea capituligera, commonly known as the Cape mountain vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea capituligera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>
