                    <h1>Vanilla grandiflora</h1>
<p>Vanilla grandiflora, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found only in its native habitat. After pollination, the flower develops into a pod-like fruit, which is harvested and cured to produce the aromatic vanilla flavoring used worldwide.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique reproductive requirements and economic value as a spice.</p>
