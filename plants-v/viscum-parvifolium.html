                    <h1>Viscum parvifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is found primarily in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for certain birds and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
