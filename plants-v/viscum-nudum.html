                    <h1>Viscum nudum</h1>
<p>Viscum nudum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing the seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum nudum has a long history of cultural and traditional significance in various parts of Europe.</p>
