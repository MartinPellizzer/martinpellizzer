                    <h1>Veronica cymbalarioides</h1>
<p>Veronica cymbalarioides, commonly known as the rock violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
