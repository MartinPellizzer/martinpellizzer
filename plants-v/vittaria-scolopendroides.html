<p>Vittaria scolopendroides, commonly known as the snake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and its finely divided, linear leaves that resemble the scales of a snake. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Vittaria scolopendroides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
