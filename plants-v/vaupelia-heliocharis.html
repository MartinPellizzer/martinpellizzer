                    <h1>Vaupelia heliocharis</h1>
<p>Vaupelia heliocharis, commonly known as the sunstar cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. The plant has a compact, globular stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Vaupelia heliocharis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
