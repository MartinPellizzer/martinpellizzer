                    <h1>Vittaria garhwalensis</h1>
<p>Vittaria garhwalensis, commonly known as the Garhwal fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices of mountainous areas. Its spores are released from small, round sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
