                    <h1>Vanilla hallei</h1>
<p>Vanilla hallei, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by dark brown pods containing the aromatic vanilla seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a trellis or support to grow properly. Its vanilla pods are used in the extraction of vanilla flavoring, similar to the more well-known vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>However, Vanilla hallei is less commonly cultivated due to its specific growing requirements and lower yield compared to other vanilla species.</p>
