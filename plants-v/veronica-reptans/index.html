                            <h1>Veronica Reptans</h1>
<p>Veronica reptans is a low-growing evergreen shrub known for its dense, carpet-like foliage. It features small, dark blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the western regions of the United States, it thrives in rocky and dry environments. This plant is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its ability to withstand drought makes it a favored choice for xeriscaping.</p>
