<p>Vexatorella obtusata subsp.</p>
<p>albomontana, commonly known as the white mountain vexatorella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
