                    <h1>Vicia pallida var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Vicia pallida var. pratensis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
