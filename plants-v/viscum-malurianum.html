                    <h1>Viscum malurianum</h1>
<p>Viscum malurianum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds that consume the berries.</p>
<p>Viscum malurianum plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
