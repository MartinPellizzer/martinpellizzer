<p>Vaccinium multiflorum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along coastal areas and is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are an important food source for pollinators.</p>
<p>Vaccinium multiflorum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments.</p>
