                    <h1>Vesiculina purpurea</h1>
<p>Vesiculina purpurea, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the water surface.</p>
<p>Vesiculina purpurea is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
