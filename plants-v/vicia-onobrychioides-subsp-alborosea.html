<p>Vicia onobrychioides subsp.</p>
<p>alborosea, commonly known as white vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-improving properties.</p>
