<p>Vitis wuhanensis var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-net grape, is a rare and lesser-known variety of the grapevine family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and tendrils that give it its common name. The plant is native to China and is typically found in mountainous regions with moist, temperate climates. Its small, clustered berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
