                    <h1>Vaccinium pallidum var. crinitum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium pallidum var. crinitum, commonly known as the silver-leaved huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost silvery foliage, which is due to dense pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to white in color, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
