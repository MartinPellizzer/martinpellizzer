<p>Vaccinium varingiifolium var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved blueberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or purple in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential as a food source for wildlife and humans.</p>
