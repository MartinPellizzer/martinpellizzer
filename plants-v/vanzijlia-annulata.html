<p>Vanzijlia annulata, commonly known as the ringed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or stones in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves.</p>
<p>The algal component plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, while the fungal partner provides structural support and protection.</p>
