                    <h1>Viscum cornifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum cornifolium, commonly known as the horned mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or yellow in color. Viscum cornifolium is adapted to thrive in shaded, forested environments where it can receive limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
