                    <h1>Vitis ulmifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis ulmifolia, commonly known as the river grape or swamp grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of the elm tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. Vitis ulmifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and swamps.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological botany.</p>
