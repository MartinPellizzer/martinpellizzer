<p>Venidium plantagineum var. angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
