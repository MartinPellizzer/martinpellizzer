<p>Vittaria elongata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
