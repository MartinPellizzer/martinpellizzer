                    <h1>Vriesea joyae var. parvula</h1>
<p>Vriesea joyae var. parvula, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
