                    <h1>Vella mairei var. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Vella mairei var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited vella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, hairy, spherical fruits that mature to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation efforts.</p>
