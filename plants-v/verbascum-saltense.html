<p>Verbascum saltense, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to desert and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Verbascum saltense is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
