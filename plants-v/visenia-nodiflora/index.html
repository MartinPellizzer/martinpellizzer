                            <h1>Visenia Nodiflora</h1>
<p>Red maple, scientifically known as Visenia nodiflora, is a strikingly beautiful deciduous tree native to eastern North America. With its vibrant red and orange foliage in the fall, it is a popular choice for landscaping and ornamental purposes. The tree is easily recognized by its opposite, palmate leaves and clusters of red flowers in early spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Despite its beauty, the red maple is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for numerous wildlife species.</p>
