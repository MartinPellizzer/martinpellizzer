                    <h1>Viscum capillare</h1>
<p>Viscum capillare, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oak and elm.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a waxy, sticky substance. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and oval in shape, and it is often associated with festive traditions in many cultures.</p>
<p>Viscum capillare plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
