                    <h1>Varronia gibberosa</h1>
<p>Varronia gibberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sand-verbena, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small gray-green leaves, and clusters of pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Varronia gibberosa is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
