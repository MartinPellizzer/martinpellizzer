<p>Vaccinium uliginosum subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum, commonly known as bog blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain evergreen throughout the year.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other Vaccinium species but is distinguished by its smaller leaves and shorter stature.</p>
