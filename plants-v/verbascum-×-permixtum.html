                    <h1>Verbascum × permixtum</h1>
<p>Verbascum × permixtum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum.</p>
<p>It is a tall, biennial or short-lived perennial plant that produces large, fuzzy, velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a notable example of natural hybridization in the genus Verbascum.</p>
