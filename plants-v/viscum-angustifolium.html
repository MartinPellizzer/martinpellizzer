<p>Viscum angustifolium, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are opposite and oval in shape. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, as it can cause damage to the host tree over time.</p>
<p>Viscum angustifolium is also notable for its traditional use in festive customs, particularly in Christmas celebrations.</p>
