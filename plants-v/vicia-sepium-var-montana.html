                    <h1>Vicia sepium var. montana</h1>
<p>Vicia sepium var. montana, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports, and trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in loose clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment and habitat restoration.</p>
