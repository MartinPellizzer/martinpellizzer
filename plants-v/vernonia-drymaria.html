                    <h1>Vernonia drymaria</h1>
<p>Vernonia drymaria, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its ability to tolerate arid conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Vernonia drymaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought-resistant properties.</p>
