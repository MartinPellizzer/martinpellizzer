<p>Vachellia bolei, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of feathery leaves and long, straight thorns. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Vachellia bolei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
