<p>Vitis thunbergii var. sinuata, commonly known as the Chinese grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five lance-shaped leaflets that are often sinuously curled, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to dark purple. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along trellises or other structures.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese horticulture.</p>
