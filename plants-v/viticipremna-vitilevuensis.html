<p>Viticipremna vitilevuensis, commonly known as the Taveuni mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the island of Taveuni in Fiji.</p>
<p>It attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily members of the Moraceae family, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
