<p>Viscum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a dense, velvety white down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds.</p>
<p>Viscum velutinum is native to Europe and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
