                    <h1>Vellozia hemisphaerica</h1>
<p>Vellozia hemisphaerica, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces unique, cone-like inflorescences that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. Vellozia hemisphaerica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
