                    <h1>Vriesea dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Vriesea dissitiflora, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette of leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea dissitiflora is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
