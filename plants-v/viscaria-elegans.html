                    <h1>Viscaria elegans</h1>
<p>Viscaria elegans, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Viscaria elegans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
