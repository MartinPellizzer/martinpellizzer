                    <h1>Vaccinium oxycoccos f. leucanthum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium oxycoccos f. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the common bilberry, distinguished by its pale pink to white flowers instead of the typical blue-purple ones. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange, differing from the dark blue berries of the typical species. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its ornamental value and its adaptation to cold climates.</p>
