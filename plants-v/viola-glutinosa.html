                    <h1>Viola glutinosa</h1>
<p>Viola glutinosa, commonly known as sticky violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces violet flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple or blue, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in moist meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>The sticky resin on its leaves is a unique characteristic that helps deter herbivores.</p>
