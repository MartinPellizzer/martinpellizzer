<p>Vicia sativa var. bobartii, commonly known as the Bobart's vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually violet or blue in color, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit due to its twining stems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
