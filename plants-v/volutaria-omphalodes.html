<p>Volutaria omphalodes, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a yellow center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate.
