<p>Verbascum molle, commonly known as soft mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>

The plant produces tall, hairy stalks that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Verbascum molle thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
