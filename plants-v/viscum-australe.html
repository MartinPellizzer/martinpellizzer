                    <h1>Viscum australe</h1>
<p>Viscum australe, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other native Australian trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Viscum australe plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
