<p>Vesicaria recurvata, commonly known as the recurved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually slender and slightly curved, and it produces small, white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>Vesicaria recurvata is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
