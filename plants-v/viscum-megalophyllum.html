<p>Viscum megalophyllum, commonly known as the giant leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with large, leathery leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Viscum megalophyllum relies on both photosynthesis and parasitism to obtain nutrients, making it a unique example of plant adaptation.</p>
