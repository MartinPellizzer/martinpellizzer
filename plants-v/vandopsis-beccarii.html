<p>Vandopsis beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's vandopsis, is a rare epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
