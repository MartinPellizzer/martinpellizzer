                    <h1>Vanilla savannarum</h1>
<p>Vanilla savannarum, commonly known as the savanna vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along its vine-like stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in rainforests or savanna habitats. Its most notable feature is the development of a vanilla-like pod, which is harvested and used in culinary and aromatic applications.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than the more famous Vanilla planifolia.</p>
