                    <h1>Viscum multicostatum</h1>
<p>Viscum multicostatum, commonly known as the many-costate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum multicostatum is native to regions in Asia, including China and Japan, and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host plant while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
