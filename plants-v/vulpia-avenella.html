                    <h1>Vulpia avenella</h1>
<p>Vulpia avenella, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are finely powdered and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Vulpia avenella is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas where it thrives in dry, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
