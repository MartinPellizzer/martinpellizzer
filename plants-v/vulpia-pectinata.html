<p>Vulpia pectinata, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs on the leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence is a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Vulpia pectinata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
