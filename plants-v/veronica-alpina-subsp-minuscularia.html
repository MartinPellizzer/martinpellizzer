<p>Veronica alpina subsp.</p>
<p>minuscularia, commonly known as the Alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
