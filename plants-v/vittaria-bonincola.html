<p>Vittaria bonincola, commonly known as the Bonin fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vittaria bonincola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
