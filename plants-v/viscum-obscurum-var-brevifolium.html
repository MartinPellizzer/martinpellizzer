                    <h1>Viscum obscurum var. brevifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum obscurum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate forests and is an important part of the ecosystem due to its role in supporting wildlife.</p>
