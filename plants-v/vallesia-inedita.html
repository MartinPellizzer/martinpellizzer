                    <h1>Vallesia inedita</h1>
<p>Vallesia inedita, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Vallesia inedita has a complex root system adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
