                    <h1>Vanilla viridiflora</h1>
<p>Vanilla viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered vanilla, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vigorous climbing habit. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with partial shade.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for vanilla flavoring due to its low yield and specific pollination requirements.</p>
