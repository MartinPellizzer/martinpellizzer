                    <h1>Volkensiella procumbens</h1>
<p>Volkensiella procumbens, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with a stout trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, reproducing through wind pollination. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a valuable but vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
