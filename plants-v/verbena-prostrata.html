                    <h1>Verbena prostrata</h1>
<p>Verbena prostrata, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Verbena prostrata is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
