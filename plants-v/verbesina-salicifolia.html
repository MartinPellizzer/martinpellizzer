                    <h1>Verbesina salicifolia</h1>
<p>Verbesina salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf beggar-tick, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
