                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum subsp. vulcanorum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum subsp.</p>
<p>vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to volcanic soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to edible, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils makes it an important component of heathland ecosystems.</p>
