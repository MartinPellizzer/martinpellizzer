                    <h1>Vriesea diminuta</h1>
<p>Vriesea diminuta, commonly known as the miniature vriesea, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant orange and red bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
