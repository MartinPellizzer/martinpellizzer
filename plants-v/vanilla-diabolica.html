                    <h1>Vanilla diabolica</h1>
<p>Vanilla diabolica, commonly known as the devil's vanilla, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety pods that resemble the vanilla beans of more common species, though it is not used for vanilla extraction. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance, and it produces its distinctive pods after a long flowering cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla diabolica is considered a conservation concern.</p>
