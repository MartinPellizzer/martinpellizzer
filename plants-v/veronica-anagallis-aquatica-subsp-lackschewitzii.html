<p>Veronica anagallis-aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>lackschewitzii, commonly known as the water speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
