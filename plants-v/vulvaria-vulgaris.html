<p>Vulvaria vulgaris, commonly known as common vulvaria, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and riverbanks. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.</p>
<p>Vulvaria vulgaris is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
