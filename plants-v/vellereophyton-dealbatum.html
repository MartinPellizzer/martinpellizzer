                    <h1>Vellereophyton dealbatum</h1>
<p>Vellereophyton dealbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
