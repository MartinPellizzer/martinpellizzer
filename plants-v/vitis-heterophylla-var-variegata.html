<p>Vitis heterophylla var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Grapevines, is a unique vine species native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or red hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into berries, which are typically dark purple when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly used for wine production, unlike other Vitis species.</p>
