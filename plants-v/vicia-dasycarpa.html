<p>Vicia dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy pod vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Vicia dasycarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
