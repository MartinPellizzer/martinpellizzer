                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. densa</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. densa, commonly known as the dense grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variety within the Vitis vinifera species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for certain ornamental and small-scale viticultural applications. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically not used for wine but may be of interest for experimental or hybrid breeding programs. It prefers temperate climates and well-drained soils, often exhibiting a moderate level of cold hardiness.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited commercial use, it is more appreciated in botanical gardens and research settings than in mainstream viticulture.</p>
