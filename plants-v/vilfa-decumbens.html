                    <h1>Vilfa decumbens</h1>
<p>Vilfa decumbens, commonly known as the creeping vilfa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Vilfa decumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
