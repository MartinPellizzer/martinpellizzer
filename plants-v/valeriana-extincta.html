                    <h1>Valeriana extincta</h1>
<p>Valeriana extincta, commonly known as the extinct valerian, is a plant species that is no longer found in the wild, having gone extinct in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>It was native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, often pink or white flowers and its medicinal properties, which were historically valued for their calming effects. Valeriana extincta belonged to the Caprifoliaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often referenced in botanical studies as a cautionary example of species loss.</p>
