                    <h1>Veratrum stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Veratrum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, stout stems and large, showy white to pale blue flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces numerous small, greenish-brown berries that contain the toxic seeds. Veratrum stenophyllum is known for its potent alkaloid content, which makes it highly toxic to both animals and humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and habitat specificity, it is often found in moist, shaded environments at high elevations.</p>
