                    <h1>Voyria parasitica</h1>
<p>Voyria parasitica, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and poplars.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, though it plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Voyria parasitica is often associated with holiday traditions due to its evergreen foliage and symbolic significance.</p>
