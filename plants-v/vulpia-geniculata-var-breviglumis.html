                    <h1>Vulpia geniculata var. breviglumis</h1>
<p>Vulpia geniculata var. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-awned bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in short awns, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats.</p>
