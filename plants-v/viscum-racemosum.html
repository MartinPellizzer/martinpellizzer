<p>Viscum racemosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance that helps it adhere to the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Viscum racemosum plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling.</p>
