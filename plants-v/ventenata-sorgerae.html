<p>[WRONG START] Vetenata sorgerae, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ventenata sorgerae plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
