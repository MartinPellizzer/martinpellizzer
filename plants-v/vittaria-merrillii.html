                    <h1>Vittaria merrillii</h1>
<p>Vittaria merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan chain fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and bipinnate leaves that are highly divided, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vittaria merrillii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
