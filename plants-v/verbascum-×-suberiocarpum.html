                    <h1>Verbascum × suberiocarpum</h1>
<p>Verbascum × suberiocarpum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum suberifolium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in a terminal spike, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it may exhibit a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species.</p>
