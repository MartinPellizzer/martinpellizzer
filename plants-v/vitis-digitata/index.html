                            <h1>Vitis Digitata</h1>
<p>Wild grape, scientifically known as Vitis digitata, is a hardy vine native to the eastern United States. This plant is often found growing in woodland areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and its clusters of small, sour-tasting berries are a common sight in the wild. While not as widely cultivated as domestic grape varieties, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of natural dye.</p>
