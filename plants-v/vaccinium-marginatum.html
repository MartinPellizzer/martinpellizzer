<p>Vaccinium marginatum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by dark blue or purple berries. Its leaves are oval and have a leathery texture, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vaccinium marginatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing food for wildlife.</p>
