                    <h1>Viscum capense</h1>
<p>Viscum capense, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as acacias and eucalyptus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum capense plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
