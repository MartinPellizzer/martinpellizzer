                    <h1>Vicia sativa f. intermedia</h1>
<p>Vicia sativa f. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and slender stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is capable of nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the standard Vicia sativa but shares many of its agricultural and ornamental traits.</p>
