                    <h1>Viscum album f. latifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum album f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are broader than those of the typical Viscum album. The plant produces small, white berries that contain viscin, a sticky substance aiding in seed attachment to host bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its presence can impact the health of host trees by draining their resources.</p>
