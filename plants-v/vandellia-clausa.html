                    <h1>Vandellia clausa</h1>
<p>Vandellia clausa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, waxy leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Vandellia clausa is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
