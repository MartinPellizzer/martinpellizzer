                    <h1>Viscum elongatum</h1>
<p>Viscum elongatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum elongatum has a distinctive appearance with its dense, evergreen foliage and intricate, branching structure.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
