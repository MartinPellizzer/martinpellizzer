                            <h1>Visenia Ulmariae</h1>
<p>Visenia ulmariae, also known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green leaves and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. This plant is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in a variety of environmental conditions. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of dye has contributed to its cultural significance. Despite its benefits, it can become invasive in certain regions, posing challenges for local ecosystems.</p>
