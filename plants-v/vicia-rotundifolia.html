                    <h1>Vicia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Vicia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are rounded and often hairy, and its long, trailing stems that produce small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Vicia rotundifolia plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
