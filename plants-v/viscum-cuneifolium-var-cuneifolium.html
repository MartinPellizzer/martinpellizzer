<p>Viscum cuneifolium var. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing sticky seeds. Its roots form haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
