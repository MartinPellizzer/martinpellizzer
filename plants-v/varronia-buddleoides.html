<p>Varronia buddleoides, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
<p>Varronia buddleoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
