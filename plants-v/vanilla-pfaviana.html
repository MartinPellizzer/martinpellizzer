                    <h1>Vanilla pfaviana</h1>
<p>Vanilla pfaviana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers, which eventually develop into the characteristic vanilla pods. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with certain fungi for its growth. Its vanilla pods are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic compound vanillin.</p>
<p>This species is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ecological and botanical significance in its native habitat.</p>
