<p>Vulpia confusa, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Vulpia confusa is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate drought and moderate grazing.</p>
