<p>Vitis repens, commonly known as sand grape or trailing grape, is a perennial vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, sour-tasting berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are typically medium to dark green.</p>
<p>Vitis repens thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks.</p>
