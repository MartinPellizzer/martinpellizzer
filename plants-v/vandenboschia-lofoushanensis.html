<p>Vandenboschia lofoushanensis, commonly known as the Lufoushan sandplant, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
