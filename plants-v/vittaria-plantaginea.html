<p>Vittaria plantaginea, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Vittaria plantaginea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
