                    <h1>Vaginularia trichoidea</h1>
<p>Vaginularia trichoidea, commonly known as the hairy sponge, is a marine sponge belonging to the order Poecilodictya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered with fine, hair-like projections called trichaea. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The sponge's structure allows it to filter feed by capturing plankton from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is important in marine ecosystems as it contributes to nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
