<p>Vicia trijuga, commonly known as the three-angled vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Vicia trijuga is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
