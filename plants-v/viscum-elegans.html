                    <h1>Viscum elegans</h1>
<p>Viscum elegans, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum elegans has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often causing no harm but sometimes leading to weakened growth in the host tree.</p>
<p>It is widely used in traditional medicine and is also a symbol of Christmas due to its association with holiday customs.</p>
