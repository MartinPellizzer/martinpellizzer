                    <h1>Vrydagzynea neohibernica</h1>
<p>Vrydagzynea neohibernica, commonly known as the Hibernian ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the misty highlands of Scotland.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded, calcareous soils among ancient woodlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale, almost ghostly hue, giving it its ethereal appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
