                    <h1>Vellozia spinulosa</h1>
<p>Vellozia spinulosa, commonly known as the spinous vellozia, is a unique plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Podostomata, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, rocky environments. Vellozia spinulosa is often found in streams and riverbanks, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to aquatic habitats.</p>
