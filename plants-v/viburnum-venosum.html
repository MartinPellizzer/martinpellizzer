                    <h1>Viburnum venosum</h1>
<p>Viburnum venosum, commonly known as black haw, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive venation pattern that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, toxic berries in the fall. Viburnum venosum is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though its berries should be kept away from livestock and children.</p>
