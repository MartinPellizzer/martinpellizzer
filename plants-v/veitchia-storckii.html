                    <h1>Veitchia storckii</h1>
<p>Veitchia storckii, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique and valuable specimen in botanical collections.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its historical significance in the horticultural trade.</p>
