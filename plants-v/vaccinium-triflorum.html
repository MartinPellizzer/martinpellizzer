                    <h1>Vaccinium triflorum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and dark green, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in the sandy soils where it thrives. Its fruits are small, tart berries that ripen to a deep blue color, often used in local culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Vaccinium triflorum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife.</p>
