<p>Vitis marchandii, commonly known as the Marchand's grape, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by small, round berries that are usually green when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a deep root system to access scarce water resources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis marchandii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
