<p>Vicia sativa var. nigra, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are often used as a forage crop for livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Black vetch is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plants.</p>
