<p>Varasia zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's varasia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Varasia zollingeri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
