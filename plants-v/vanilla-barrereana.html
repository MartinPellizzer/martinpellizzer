                    <h1>Vanilla barrereana</h1>
<p>Vanilla barrereana, commonly known as the Borneo vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It produces long, fragrant tendrils that can reach several meters in length, which are used for climbing and supporting the plant. The plant's flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. Vanilla barrereana is valued for its aromatic pods, which are harvested and used in the production of vanilla extract.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
