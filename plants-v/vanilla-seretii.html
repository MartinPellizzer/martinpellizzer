                    <h1>Vanilla seretii</h1>
<p>Vanilla seretii, commonly known as the African vanilla or the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its fragrant, dark brown pods, which contain the aromatic seeds used to make vanilla extract. The botanical characteristics of Vanilla seretii include its climbing habit, heart-shaped leaves, and its reliance on symbiotic pollination for fruit development.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific pollination requirements, it is less commonly cultivated than vanilla planifolia.</p>
