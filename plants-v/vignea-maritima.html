<p>Vignea maritima, commonly known as the sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, grape-like fruits that are edible and often consumed raw or used in local cuisine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Vignea maritima is well adapted to maritime climates and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
