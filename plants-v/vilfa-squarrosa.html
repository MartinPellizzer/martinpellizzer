                    <h1>Vilfa squarrosa</h1>
<p>Vilfa squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it can attach to a variety of host plants. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
