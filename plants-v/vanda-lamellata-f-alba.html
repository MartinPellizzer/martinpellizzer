                    <h1>Vanda lamellata f. alba</h1>
<p>Vanda lamellata f. alba, commonly known as the white vanda, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique coloration.</p>
