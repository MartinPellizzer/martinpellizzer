                    <h1>Vicia pellucida</h1>
<p>Vicia pellucida, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia pellucida is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
