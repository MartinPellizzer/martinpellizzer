<p>Verbena strigosa, commonly known as silver verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Verbena strigosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
