<p>Vicia monantha subsp.</p>
<p>monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
