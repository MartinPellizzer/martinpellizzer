                    <h1>Vanilla dietschiana</h1>
<p>Vanilla dietschiana, commonly known as the Schott's vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are similar in appearance to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a warm climate with high rainfall. Its flowers are typically yellowish-green with a distinctive, spurred lip.</p>
<p>The vanilla flavor of its pods is less intense compared to commercial vanilla, but it is still valued in some culinary and aromatic applications.</p>
