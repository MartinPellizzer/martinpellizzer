                    <h1>Vigna tuberosa</h1>
<p>Vigna tuberosa, commonly known as the cowpea or African bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, usually pink or white, pea-like flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. Vigna tuberosa is well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions, making it an important crop in many parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features contribute to its role in both traditional agriculture and ecological systems.</p>
