                    <h1>Vulpia bromoides var. sciuroides</h1>
<p>Vulpia bromoides var. sciuroides, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
