<p>Viola brittoniana f. pectinata is a rare and striking hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is known for its vibrant violet flowers and unique, pectinate foliage that sets it apart from other viola species. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its delicate beauty makes it a prized addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
