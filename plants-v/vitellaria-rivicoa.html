<p>Vitellaria rivicoa, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a rich, buttery seed kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Vitellaria rivicoa plays a vital role in local ecosystems and supports biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
