                    <h1>Vicia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Vicia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic vetch, is a flowering plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often found in areas with recent volcanic activity.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments.</p>
