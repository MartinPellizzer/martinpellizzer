                    <h1>Viscum demissum var. mahafalense</h1>
<p>Viscum demissum var. mahafalense, commonly known as the Mahafal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its unique adaptations to its island environment.</p>
