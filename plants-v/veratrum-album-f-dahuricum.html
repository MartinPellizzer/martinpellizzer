                    <h1>Veratrum album f. dahuricum</h1>
<p>Veratrum album f. dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels and have a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Its roots and rhizomes contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both medicinal and cautionary interest.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common white hellebore (Veratrum album) but exhibits distinct morphological and ecological characteristics.</p>
