<p>Vicia communis var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with obovate leaflets, which are broad and rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds.
