                    <h1>Vitis adenocaulis var. articulata</h1>
<p>Vitis adenocaulis var. articulata, commonly known as the creeping grape or trailing grape, is a rare and unique variant of the grapevine species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
