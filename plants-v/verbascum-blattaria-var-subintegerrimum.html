                    <h1>Verbascum blattaria var. subintegerrimum</h1>
<p>Verbascum blattaria var. subintegerrimum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a loose, branching inflorescence. Its leaves are densely covered with soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact and less lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Verbascum blattaria.</p>
