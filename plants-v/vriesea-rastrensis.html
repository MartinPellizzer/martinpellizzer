<p>Vriesea rastrensis, commonly known as the Rastrensis Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea rastrensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and prolonged blooming period.</p>
