<p>Vanda helvola, commonly known as the golden vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Vanda helvola thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation for optimal growth.</p>
