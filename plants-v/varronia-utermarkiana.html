<p>Varronia utermarkiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Varronia utermarkiana is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
