<p>Viola subasica, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow beard on the lower lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Viola genus. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Viola subasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates.</p>
