<p>Vriesea guttata var. striata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, striped foliage that resembles a zebra's pattern, with alternating light and dark green bands. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting orange or red flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
