                    <h1>Viscum vohimavoense var. complanatum</h1>
<p>Viscum vohimavoense var. complanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant has flat, leathery leaves and produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
