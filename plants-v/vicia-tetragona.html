<p>Vicia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate with a hairy texture. Vicia tetragona is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
