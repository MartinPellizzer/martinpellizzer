<p>Vinticena lasiodiscus, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
