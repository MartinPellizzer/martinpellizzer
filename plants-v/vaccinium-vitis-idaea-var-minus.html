                    <h1>Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. minus</h1>
<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. minus, commonly known as lesser bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical V. vitis-idaea and is adapted to harsh, cold climates.</p>
