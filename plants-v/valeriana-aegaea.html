<p>Valeriana aegaea, commonly known as the Greater Valerian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly valerenic acid. Its rhizomatous root system is often used in traditional medicine for its sedative and calming properties.</p>
<p>Valeriana aegaea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas.</p>
