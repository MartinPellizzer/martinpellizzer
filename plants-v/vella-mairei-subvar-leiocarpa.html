                    <h1>Vella mairei subvar. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Vella mairei subvar. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded vella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and features pale green, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subvariety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
