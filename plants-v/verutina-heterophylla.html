                    <h1>Verutina heterophylla</h1>
<p>Verutina heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf verutina, is a unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its morphological variability, with leaves that can range from ovate to lanceolate in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale greenish-white color, which helps in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Verutina heterophylla is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
