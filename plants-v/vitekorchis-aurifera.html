                    <h1>Vitekorchis aurifera</h1>
<p>Vitekorchis aurifera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns that resemble golden threads. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often among mossy rocks or in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the acidic soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitekorchis aurifera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
