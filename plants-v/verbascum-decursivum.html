<p>Verbascum decursivum, commonly known as the creeping mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and tall, upright stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment.</p>
<p>Verbascum decursivum is often used in herbal medicine for its potential respiratory benefits.</p>
