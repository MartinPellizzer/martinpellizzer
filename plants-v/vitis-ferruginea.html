<p>Vitis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of round, yellow to orange berries. Vitis ferruginea is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible but have a tart, musky flavor, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
