<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with distinctive streaks or stripes on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Vanda fasciata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation.</p>
