<p>Vaccinium epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic blueberry, is a rare and unique species of the Vacciniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid and shaded environments like tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Its berries are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Vaccinium species.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species.</p>
