                    <h1>Viscum fargesii</h1>
<p>Viscum fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Tsuga.</p>
<p>It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are often red or yellow when mature. Viscum fargesii is native to the mountainous regions of China and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
