<p>Vanda fuscoviridis, commonly known as the dark green vanda, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms with fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that have prominent purple veins.</p>
<p>Vanda fuscoviridis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
