                    <h1>Veronica imperfoliata</h1>
<p>Veronica imperfoliata, commonly known as the leafless speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having scale-like structures that reduce water loss in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Veronica imperfoliata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
