<p>Verticordia brevifolia subsp.</p>
<p>stirlingensis, commonly known as the Stirling's squill, is a rare and striking member of the Myrtaceae family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathland environments, often in areas with low rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is known for its compact, shrub-like growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
