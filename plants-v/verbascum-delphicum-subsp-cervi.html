<p>Verbascum delphicum subsp.</p>
<p>cervi, commonly known as the Alpine mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
