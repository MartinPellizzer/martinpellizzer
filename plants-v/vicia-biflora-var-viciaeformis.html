<p>Vicia biflora var. viciaeformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, lens-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility.</p>
