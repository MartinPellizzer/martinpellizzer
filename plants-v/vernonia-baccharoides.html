<p>Vernonia baccharoides, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a shrub native to the eastern and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Vernonia baccharoides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
