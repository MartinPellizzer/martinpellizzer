                    <h1>Vatica africana var. glomerata</h1>
<p>Vatica africana var. glomerata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, heavy wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
