<p>Veronica ivoides, commonly known as the common speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Veronica ivoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
