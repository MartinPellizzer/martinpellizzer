<p>Volkensinia prostrata f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prostrate volkensinia, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
