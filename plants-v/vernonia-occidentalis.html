The plant produces achene fruits, which are small, dry, and typically have a pappus for wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Vernonia occidentalis is valued in ecological landscapes for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
