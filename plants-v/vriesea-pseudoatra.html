<p>Vriesea pseudoatra, commonly known as the Black Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, often red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is evergreen, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Vriesea pseudoatra is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
