<p>Veronica finaustrina, commonly known as the coastal veronica, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal areas. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>Veronica finaustrina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
