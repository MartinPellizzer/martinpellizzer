                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. corruptibilis</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. corruptibilis, commonly known as the fragile grapevine, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate foliage and smaller, more clustered berries compared to its more robust relatives. The plant exhibits a shorter growth cycle, making it suitable for specific microclimates and shorter growing seasons. Its berries, while less commercially viable, are prized in niche horticultural circles for their unique flavor profiles.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it requires careful cultivation and is often grown in protected environments.</p>
