<p>Viscum iringense, commonly known as the Irish mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of deciduous trees, primarily oak and hawthorn, in temperate regions of Europe. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phylloids. Its berries are small, white or yellowish, and contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Viscum iringense plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
