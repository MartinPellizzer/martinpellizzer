                    <h1>Vulpia uniglumis var. longiseta</h1>
<p>Vulpia uniglumis var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-hairy vulpia, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture on both surfaces. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, particularly in coastal areas and along roadsides.</p>
