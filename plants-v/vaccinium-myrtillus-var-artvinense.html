                    <h1>Vaccinium myrtillus var. artvinense</h1>
<p>Vaccinium myrtillus var. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin bilberry, is a rare variant of the bilberry native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark blue berries that are similar in appearance to those of the common bilberry but are typically smaller and more intensely colored. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boreal and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, while its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and typically pink or white.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic distinctiveness.</p>
