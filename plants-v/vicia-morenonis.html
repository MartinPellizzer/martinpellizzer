                    <h1>Vicia morenonis</h1>
<p>Vicia morenonis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia morenonis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
