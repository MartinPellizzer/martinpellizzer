                    <h1>Vitex caespitosa</h1>
<p>Vitex caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping chaste tree, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a woody stem that often grows in dense, mat-like formations. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and showy floral display.</p>
