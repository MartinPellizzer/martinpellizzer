                    <h1>Viscum monstrosum</h1>
<p>Viscum monstrosum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a dense, spongy tissue. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Viscum monstrosum is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species.</p>
