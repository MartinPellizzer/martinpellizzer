                    <h1>Vicia podocarpa</h1>
<p>Vicia podocarpa, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Vicia podocarpa thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
