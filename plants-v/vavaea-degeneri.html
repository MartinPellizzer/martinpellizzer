<p>Vavaea degeneri, commonly known as the degeneri vavaea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vavaea degeneri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
