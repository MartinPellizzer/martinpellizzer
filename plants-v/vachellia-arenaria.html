                    <h1>Vachellia arenaria</h1>
<p>Vachellia arenaria, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in dense, globular inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Vachellia arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
