                <h1>Vittaria minima</h1>
<p>Vittaria minima, commonly known as the miniature fern or the pygmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its fronds are delicate, with a compact, rosette-like structure that allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
<p>Vittaria minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
