                    <h1>Vauquelinia potosina</h1>
<p>Vauquelinia potosina, commonly known as the Mexican rocknettle, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Vauquelinia potosina is adapted to arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
