                    <h1>Viola rupestris var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Viola rupestris var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand viol, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate violet or purple flowers with five petals, often appearing in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
