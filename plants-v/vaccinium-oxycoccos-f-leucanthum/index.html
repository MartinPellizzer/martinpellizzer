                            <h1>Vaccinium Oxycoccos F. Leucanthum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium oxycoccos f. leucanthum is a unique variant of the cranberry plant known for its striking white flowers. This low-growing shrub thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the common cranberry, yet it stands out with its distinctive coloration. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats. It serves as a valuable subject for both horticultural study and environmental conservation efforts.</p>
