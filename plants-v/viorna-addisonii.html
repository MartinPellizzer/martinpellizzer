<p>Viorna addisonii, commonly known as the Addison's viorna, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Viorna addisonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
