                    <h1>Vangueria loranthifolia</h1>
<p>Vangueria loranthifolia, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on a variety of host trees in subtropical and tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by absorbing water and nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
