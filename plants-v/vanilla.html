                    <h1>Vanilla</h1>
<p>Vanilla, commonly known as the orchid *Vanilla planifolia*, is a tropical vine native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by a specific species of bee, which is rarely found outside its native habitat, making natural vanilla production challenging. The vanilla bean, which develops from the flower after hand-pollination, is harvested and cured through a process of drying and sweating to develop its characteristic aroma. The plant's fragrant pods contain essential oils and compounds like vanillin, which are responsible for its rich flavor.</p>
<p>Vanilla is now cultivated worldwide, but its unique botanical and agricultural requirements make it a prized and complex crop.</p>
