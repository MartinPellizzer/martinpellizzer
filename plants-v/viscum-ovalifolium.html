                    <h1>Viscum ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by waxy, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on its host tree, depending on the ecological context.</p>
