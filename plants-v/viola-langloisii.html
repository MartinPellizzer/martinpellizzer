<p>Viola langloisii, commonly known as the Langlois violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple and blue. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Viola langloisii is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in high-altitude environments.</p>
