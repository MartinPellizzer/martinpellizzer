                    <h1>Veratrum formosanum</h1>
<p>Veratrum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Veratrum formosanum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
