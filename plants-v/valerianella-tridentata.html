<p>Valerianella tridentata, commonly known as three-toothed valerian, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Valerianella tridentata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and calming properties.</p>
