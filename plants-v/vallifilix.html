<p>Vallifilix, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often serrated fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
