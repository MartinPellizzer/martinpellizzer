                    <h1>Vulpia inops var. glabra</h1>
<p>Vulpia inops var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name "glabra.". The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
