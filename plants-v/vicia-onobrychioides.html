                    <h1>Vicia onobrychioides</h1>
<p>Vicia onobrychioides, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>Vicia onobrychioides is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its hardy nature and ability to colonize degraded areas.</p>
