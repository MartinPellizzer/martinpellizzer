                            <h1>Vernonia Angustifolia Var. Scaberrima</h1>
<p>Vernonia angustifolia var. scaberrima is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This variant is characterized by its narrow leaves and bristly texture, which give it a rugged and resilient look. Native to regions of North America, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Despite its tough exterior, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Its unique features make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
