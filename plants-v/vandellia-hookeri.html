<p>Vandellia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's vandellia, is a unique epiphytic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Vandellia hookeri is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it thrives in the canopy of tropical forests.</p>
