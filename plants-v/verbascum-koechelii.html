<p>Verbascum koechelii, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial herb native to the deserts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
