                    <h1>Vaccinium harbisonii</h1>
<p>Vaccinium harbisonii, commonly known as the Harbison huckleberry, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many species of heathers and blueberries. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coniferous forest understories. Its small, dark blue berries are edible and have a tart flavor, though they are not as commonly consumed as other Vaccinium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
