<p>Viscum incanum, commonly known as the whitish mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Viscum incanum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
