                    <h1>Villebrunea</h1>
<p>Villebrunea, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Villebrunea has specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves, and it produces woody fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
