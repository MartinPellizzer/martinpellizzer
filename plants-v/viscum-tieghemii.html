<p>Viscum tieghemii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria, while it performs photosynthesis using its leaves. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Viscum tieghemii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
