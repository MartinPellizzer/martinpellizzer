                    <h1>Vulpia incrassata</h1>
<p>Vulpia incrassata, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands, and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Vulpia incrassata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
