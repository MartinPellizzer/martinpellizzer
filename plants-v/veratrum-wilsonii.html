<p>Veratrum wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Veratrum wilsonii contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested.</p>
