<p>Viscum lanceolatoellipticum, commonly known as the lanceolate-elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with a variety of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host if left unchecked.</p>
