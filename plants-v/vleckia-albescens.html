                    <h1>Vleckia albescens</h1>
<p>Vleckia albescens, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Vleckia albescens is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
