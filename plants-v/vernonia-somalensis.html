                    <h1>Vernonia somalensis</h1>
<p>Vernonia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vernonia somalensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
