<p>Vellosiella westermanii, commonly known as the Westerman's vellosiella, is a small, aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thalloid structure that forms a dense, mat-like growth on submerged or wet surfaces. The plant exhibits a distinct thallus with a central axis and lateral branches, often covered in fine, filamentous structures. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with moderate light exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive species within the liverwort family.</p>
