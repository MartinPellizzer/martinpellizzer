                    <h1>Viscum album var. rubroaurantiacum</h1>
<p>Viscum album var. rubroaurantiacum, commonly known as the red-orange mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-orange, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Its twining stems and specialized roots allow it to attach to and draw nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking coloration and is often used in festive decorations, though it contains toxic compounds.</p>
