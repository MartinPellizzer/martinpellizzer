                    <h1>Viscum cylindricum</h1>
<p>Viscum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustorium.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on coniferous trees, particularly pines, and is native to regions in Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy coating, while its flowers are unisexual and arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Viscum cylindricum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
