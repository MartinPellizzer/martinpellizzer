<p>Vicia suberviformis, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers. The plant produces slender, twisting pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Vicia suberviformis has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
