                            <h1>Veronica Serpyllifolia Subsp. Repens</h1>
<p>Veronica serpyllifolia subsp. repens is a low-growing perennial plant commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils. It is known for its creeping growth habit and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions around the world. Its simple structure and resilience make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and natural settings.</p>
