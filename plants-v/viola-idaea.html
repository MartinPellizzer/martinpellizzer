                    <h1>Viola idaea</h1>
<p>Viola idaea, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white, woolly flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Pyrenees. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Viola idaea is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions due to its limited habitat and ecological significance.</p>
