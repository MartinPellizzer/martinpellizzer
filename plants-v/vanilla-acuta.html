                    <h1>Vanilla acuta</h1>
<p>Vanilla acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, dark brown pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>While not as commercially valuable as vanilla planifolia, it is appreciated for its unique foliage and floral characteristics.</p>
