                    <h1>Vilfa richardsonis</h1>
<p>Vilfa richardsonis, commonly known as the Richardson's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose growth form, with a thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
