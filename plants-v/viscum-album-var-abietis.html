                    <h1>Viscum album var. abietis</h1>
<p>Viscum album var. abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its evergreen foliage remains throughout the year, contributing to its characteristic appearance in forests.</p>
<p>Viscum album var. abietis plays a significant ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
