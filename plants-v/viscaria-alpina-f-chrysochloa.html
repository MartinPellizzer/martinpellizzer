<p>Viscaria alpina f. chrysochloa, commonly known as the golden-leaved alpine mouse-ear.</p>
<p>This plant is a succulent perennial with a low-growing habit, featuring dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green but turn a striking golden yellow in full sun. The foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
