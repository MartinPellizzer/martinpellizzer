                    <h1>Veronica brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Veronica brachyphylla, commonly known as the coastal veronica, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along rocky shores and coastal bluffs. The plant features small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Veronica brachyphylla is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime environments.</p>
