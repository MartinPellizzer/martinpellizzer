<p>Vittaria forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Vittaria forbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
