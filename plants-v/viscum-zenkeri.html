                    <h1>Viscum zenkeri</h1>
<p>Viscum zenkeri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Viscum zenkeri is native to tropical Africa and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
