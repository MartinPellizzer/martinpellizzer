<p>Vachellia bilimekii, commonly known as the camel thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, small compound leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from underground sources. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that opens to release the seeds when conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>Vachellia bilimekii plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
