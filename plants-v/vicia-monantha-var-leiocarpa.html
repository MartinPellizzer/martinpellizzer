                    <h1>Vicia monantha var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Vicia monantha var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothpod vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by inflated, smooth pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can play a role in soil enrichment in certain environments.</p>
