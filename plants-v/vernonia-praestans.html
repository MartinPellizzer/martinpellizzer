<p>Vernonia praestans, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a striking perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in a composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Vernonia praestans is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies.</p>
