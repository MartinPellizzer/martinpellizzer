<p>Virola weberbaueri, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange, followed by large, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Virola weberbaueri plays a vital role in its ecosystem as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also threatened by deforestation and overharvesting.</p>
