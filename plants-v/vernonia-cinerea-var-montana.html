                    <h1>Vernonia cinerea var. montana</h1>
<p>Vernonia cinerea var. montana, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and northern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish composite flowers. It thrives in dry to moist soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and pollinator support.</p>
