                    <h1>Vriesea gruberi</h1>
<p>Vriesea gruberi, commonly known as the Schomburgk's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central tank for collecting rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea gruberi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
