<p>Vulpia, commonly known as goat's rue, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Vulpia species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and are adapted to dry, open habitats.</p>
