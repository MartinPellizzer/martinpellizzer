<p>Vulpia tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's veldtgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
