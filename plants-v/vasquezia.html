                    <h1>Vasquezia</h1>
<p>Vasquezia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Vasquezia species are typically perennial, with deep root systems that allow them to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance, some species are cultivated in gardens and landscapes in suitable climates.</p>
