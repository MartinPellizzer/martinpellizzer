<p>Vittaria karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vittaria karsteniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens.</p>
