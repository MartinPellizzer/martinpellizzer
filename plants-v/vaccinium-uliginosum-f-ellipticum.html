                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum f. ellipticum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic bog bilberry, is a variant of the bog bilberry native to acidic, wet environments in northern regions.</p>
<p>This form exhibits elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. It produces small, dark blue berries that are similar in appearance to the standard bog bilberry but may have a slightly different flavor profile. The plant thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation in its native range.</p>
