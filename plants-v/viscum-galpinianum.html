                    <h1>Viscum galpinianum</h1>
<p>Viscum galpinianum, commonly known as the Galpin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum galpinianum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing habitat for various insect species.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the host trees.</p>
