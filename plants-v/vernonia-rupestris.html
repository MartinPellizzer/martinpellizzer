<p>Vernonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock Vernonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments.

Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Vernonia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest.</p>
