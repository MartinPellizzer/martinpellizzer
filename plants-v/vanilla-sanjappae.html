<p>Vanilla sanjappae, commonly known as the Sanjappa vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that contain the aromatic vanilla beans used in culinary applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vanilla sanjappae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
