<p>Vaccinium bissei, commonly known as the dwarf huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of less than 30 cm, with small, leathery leaves that are dark green and densely packed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Vaccinium bissei plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for birds and small mammals.</p>
