<p>Vernonia palustris, commonly known as swamp ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct grayish-green color.</p>
<p>Vernonia palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
