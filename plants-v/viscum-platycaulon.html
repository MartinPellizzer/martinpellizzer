                    <h1>Viscum platycaulon</h1>
<p>Viscum platycaulon, commonly known as the broad-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Viscum platycaulon is found in temperate regions and is often associated with oak and elm trees.</p>
