                    <h1>Veronica amplectens</h1>
<p>Veronica amplectens, commonly known as the clustered speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Veronica amplectens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
