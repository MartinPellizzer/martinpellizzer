<p>Volutaria lippii, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a bright yellow to orange-green thallus that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
