<p>Vesicaria dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often have a glandular surface, contributing to its ability to capture prey.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and yellowish, with distinctive spurred petals that aid in pollination.</p>
