                    <h1>Viscum aphyllum</h1>
<p>Viscum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its yellowish, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum aphyllum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
