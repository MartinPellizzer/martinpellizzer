                    <h1>Vaccinium amplexicaule</h1>
<p>Vaccinium amplexicaule, commonly known as the clustered blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue or black berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Vaccinium amplexicaule thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
