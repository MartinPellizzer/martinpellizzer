<p>Vesiculina tenella, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a green alga that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, gelatinous mats on rocky substrates, often in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus that is flat and ribbon-like, composed of a single layer of cells. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Vesiculina tenella plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
