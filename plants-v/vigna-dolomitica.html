                    <h1>Vigna dolomitica</h1>
<p>Vigna dolomitica, commonly known as the dolomite bean, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Vigna dolomitica is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological resilience.</p>
