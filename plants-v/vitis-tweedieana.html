<p>Vitis tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's grape, is a species of flowering vine native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Vitis tweedieana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in viticulture due to its small size and specific growing requirements.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology.</p>
