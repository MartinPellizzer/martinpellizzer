<p>Vesicaria lescurii, commonly known as the Lescuria bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that can inflate with air, resembling bladders, which help it float on the water's surface. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it is often pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Vesicaria lescurii is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
