                    <h1>Viscum grandifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum grandifolium is native to various regions in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>Its evergreen leaves and unique parasitic growth habit make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
