                    <h1>Veyretia rupestris</h1>
<p>Veyretia rupestris, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Veyretia rupestris is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
