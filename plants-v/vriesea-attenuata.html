The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea attenuata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
