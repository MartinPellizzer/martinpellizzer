<p>Vitis vinifera subsp.</p>
<p>sylvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a subspecies native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its vigorous growth, often forming dense thickets, and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of cultivated grapevines. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it is known for its strong, woody vines that can climb or spread along the ground.</p>
<p>This subspecies is considered an important ancestor in the domestication of wine and table grapes.</p>
