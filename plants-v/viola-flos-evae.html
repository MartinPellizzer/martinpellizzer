                    <h1>Viola flos-evae</h1>
<p>Viola flos-evae, commonly known as the "Queen of the Night," is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety petals that range in color from deep violet to almost black, creating an otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, Viola flos-evae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
