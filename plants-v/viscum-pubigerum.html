<p>Viscum pubigerum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Viscum pubigerum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting a variety of insects and birds.</p>
