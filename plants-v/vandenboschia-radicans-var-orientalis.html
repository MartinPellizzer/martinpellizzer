                    <h1>Vandenboschia radicans var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Vandenboschia radicans var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sandmat, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance.</p>
