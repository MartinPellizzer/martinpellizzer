<p>Vaccinium buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue to purple in color, similar to other species in the Vaccinium genus. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape and resemble those of boxwood, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Vaccinium buxifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
