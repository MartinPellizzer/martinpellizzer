<p>Verbascum tetrandrum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are large, broad, and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Verbascum tetrandrum is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates.</p>
