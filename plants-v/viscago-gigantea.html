                <h1>Viscago gigantea</h1>
<p>Viscago gigantea, commonly known as giant mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leafy stems and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
