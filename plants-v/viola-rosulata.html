<p>Viola rosulata, commonly known as the Rosette Violet, is a species of flowering plant in the Violaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with yellow markings, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
