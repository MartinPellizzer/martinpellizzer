                    <h1>Vilfa scabrifolia</h1>
<p>Vilfa scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf vilfa, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Vilfa scabrifolia is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
