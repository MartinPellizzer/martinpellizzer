<p>Vandellia stemodioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaf-like structures for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
