                    <h1>Vicia grossheimii</h1>
<p>Vicia grossheimii, commonly known as the Grossheim's vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia grossheimii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
