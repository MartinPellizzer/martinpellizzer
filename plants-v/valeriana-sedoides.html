<p>Valeriana sedoides, commonly known as the clustered valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds such as valerenic acid, which contribute to its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Valeriana sedoides is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat.</p>
