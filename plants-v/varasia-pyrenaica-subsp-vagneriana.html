<p>Varasia pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>vagneriana, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Varasia pyrenaica. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
