                    <h1>Veronica maritima</h1>
<p>Veronica maritima, commonly known as sea hare or coastal speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, tolerating salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. The plant features slender, creeping stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Veronica maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
