                            <h1>Vatica Nitida</h1>
<p>Vatica nitida is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia known for its valuable timber and ornamental qualities. This evergreen species thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland forests. Its straight grain and durable wood make it highly sought after in the furniture and construction industries. The tree also plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to overharvesting, Vatica nitida is now listed as a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
