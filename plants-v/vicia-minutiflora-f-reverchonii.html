                    <h1>Vicia minutiflora f. reverchonii</h1>
<p>Vicia minutiflora f. reverchonii, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a hemicryptophyte native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is often nodulated, hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
