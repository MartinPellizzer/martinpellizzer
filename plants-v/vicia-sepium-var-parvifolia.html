<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attachment to animals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically pale blue to purple, appearing in racemes during late spring to early summer.</p>
