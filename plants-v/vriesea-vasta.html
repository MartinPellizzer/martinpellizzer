                    <h1>Vriesea vasta</h1>
<p>Vriesea vasta, commonly known as the giant vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea vasta is popular as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
