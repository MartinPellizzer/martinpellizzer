<p>Vachellia leucophloea, commonly known as the white-wood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are deciduous during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that access groundwater.</p>
<p>Vachellia leucophloea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
