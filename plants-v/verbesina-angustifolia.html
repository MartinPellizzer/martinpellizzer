<p>Verbesina angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beggar-ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in bristly, spiny structures that aid in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Verbesina angustifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woods.</p>
