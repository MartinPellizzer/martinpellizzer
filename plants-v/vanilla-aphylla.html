                    <h1>Vanilla aphylla</h1>
<p>Vanilla aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom once a year, often in the summer months. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vanilla aphylla is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
