                    <h1>Vulpia ciliata f. depauperata</h1>
<p>Vulpia ciliata f. depauperata, commonly known as the slender vulpia, is a rare and lesser-known form of the common vulpia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing grass species characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and reduced floral structures. This form typically occurs in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a distinctive, sparsely branched inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and genetic variation.</p>
