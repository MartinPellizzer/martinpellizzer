<p>Vicia ludoviciana, commonly known as the Louisiana vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system also helps prevent soil erosion in riparian areas.</p>
