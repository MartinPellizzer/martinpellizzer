<p>Vachellia eburnea, commonly known as the white thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Vachellia eburnea plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for its wood and as a source of fodder.</p>
