<p>Vitis riparia, commonly known as riverbank grape, is a North American vine native to moist, riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue-black berries. The plant is often used in viticulture for its cold hardiness and disease resistance. Its roots can tolerate waterlogged soils, making it well-suited for wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Vitis riparia also serves as a food source for various wildlife species.</p>
