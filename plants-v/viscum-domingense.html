                    <h1>Viscum domingense</h1>
<p>Viscum domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Viscum domingense is native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica, and is often found in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host tree while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
