                    <h1>Vulpia pseudomyuros</h1>
<p>Vulpia pseudomyuros, commonly known as false veldtgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Vulpia pseudomyuros plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
