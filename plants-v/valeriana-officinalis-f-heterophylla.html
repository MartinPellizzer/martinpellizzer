                    <h1>Valeriana officinalis f. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Valeriana officinalis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the heterophyllous valerian, is a variant of the common valerian, characterized by its distinct leaf morphology.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often more elongated and varied in shape compared to the typical form, which is an adaptation to its specific ecological niche. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the main species, and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its calming effects.</p>
