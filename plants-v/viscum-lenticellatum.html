                    <h1>Viscum lenticellatum</h1>
<p>Viscum lenticellatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees such as oak, apple, and poplar.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to its host via a structure called a haustellum, which absorbs water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Viscum lenticellatum is often associated with festive traditions, particularly during the Christmas season.</p>
