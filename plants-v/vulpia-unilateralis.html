                    <h1>Vulpia unilateralis</h1>
<p>Vulpia unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a slender, erect stem with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Vulpia unilateralis is often found in open, sunny habitats and is relatively resilient to environmental stress.</p>
