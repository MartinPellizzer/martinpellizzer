                    <h1>Vulpia gypsophila</h1>
<p>Vulpia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those high in gypsum content, and is often found in disturbed or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
