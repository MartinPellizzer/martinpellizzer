                    <h1>Vriesea roethii</h1>
<p>Vriesea roethii, commonly known as the Red-tipped Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces showy inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom sequentially. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea roethii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
