                    <h1>Vicia aphylla</h1>
<p>Vicia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and the absence of true leaves, instead bearing small, stipitate stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits. Vicia aphylla is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
