<p>Vanilla oroana, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine with elongated, waxy leaves and produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its vanilla-like aroma, which is derived from the scent of its blossoms. Unlike true vanilla, it does not yield a commercial vanilla extract but is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires a support structure for its climbing growth.</p>
