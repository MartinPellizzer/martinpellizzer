                    <h1>Vieusseuxia collina</h1>
<p>Vieusseuxia collina, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that ranges in color from greenish to brownish. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
