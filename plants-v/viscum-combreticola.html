                    <h1>Viscum combreticola</h1>
<p>Viscum combreticola, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
