<p>Vigna pubigera var. benuensis, commonly known as the Benuan cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
