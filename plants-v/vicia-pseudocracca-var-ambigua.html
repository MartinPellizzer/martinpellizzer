                    <h1>Vicia pseudocracca var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Vicia pseudocracca var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its morphological variability, it is sometimes confused with other vetch species.</p>
