                    <h1>Vitis × instabilis</h1>
<p>Vitis × instabilis, commonly known as the unstable grape, is a hybrid species within the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and variable morphology, which has led to its name. The plant typically produces tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers. Its berries are usually small and can vary in color from green to black.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic instability, it is often used in breeding programs to develop new grape varieties.</p>
