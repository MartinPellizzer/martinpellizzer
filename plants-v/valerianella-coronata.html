                    <h1>Valerianella coronata</h1>
<p>Valerianella coronata, commonly known as buttonweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling tiny buttons, hence its common name. The plant has a sprawling habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Valerianella coronata is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed due to its aggressive growth.</p>
