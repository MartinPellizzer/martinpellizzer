<p>Verbascum wallrothii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Verbascum wallrothii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
