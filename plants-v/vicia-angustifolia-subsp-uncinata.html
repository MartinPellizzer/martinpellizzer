<p>Vicia angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>uncinata, commonly known as the hooked narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, twisted pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hooked stipules and its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
