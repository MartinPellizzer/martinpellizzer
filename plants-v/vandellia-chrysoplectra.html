                    <h1>Vandellia chrysoplectra</h1>
<p>Vandellia chrysoplectra, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid rainforests of Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia chrysoplectra is considered a conservation concern.</p>
