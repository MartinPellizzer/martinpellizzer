                            <h1>Volvulus Sepium</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Volvulus sepium, is a tropical weed notorious for its aggressive growth and invasive tendencies. This plant is native to Africa but has spread to various parts of the world, including Asia and the Americas, where it often competes with native flora. Its broad, heart-shaped leaves are covered in a fine, velvety texture that gives it its common name. Velvetleaf thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly dominate agricultural fields and natural habitats. Due to its rapid reproduction and resilience, it poses a significant challenge for farmers and land managers.</p>
