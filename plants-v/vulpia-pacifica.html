                    <h1>Vulpia pacifica</h1>
<p>Vulpia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and along shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Vulpia pacifica plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal environments.</p>
