                    <h1>Viscago unilateralis</h1>
<p>Viscago unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Viscago unilateralis thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique growth pattern and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
