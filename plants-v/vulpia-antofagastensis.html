<p>Vulpia antofagastensis, commonly known as the Antofagasta hairgrass, is a small annual grass species native to South America, particularly Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
