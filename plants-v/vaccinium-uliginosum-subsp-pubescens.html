<p>Vaccinium uliginosum subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic environments in northern regions. It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant features hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other Vaccinium species. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
