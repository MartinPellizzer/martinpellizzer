                    <h1>Vitis digitata</h1>
<p>Vitis digitata, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with 5-7 leaflets, and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its robust growth and ability to climb using tendrils, often found along forest edges or in shaded areas. Its berries, which ripen in the fall, are edible but generally less palatable than those of cultivated grape varieties.</p>
<p>Vitis digitata is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity.</p>
