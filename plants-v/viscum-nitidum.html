                    <h1>Viscum nitidum</h1>
<p>Viscum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small white or pink flowers followed by round, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum nitidum relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its berries are not digestible and pass through the digestive system intact.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
