                    <h1>Vanda × boumaniae</h1>
<p>Vanda × boumaniae, commonly known as the Bouman's Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent plants, Vanda coerulea and Vanda terricola.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Vanda × boumaniae thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light.</p>
