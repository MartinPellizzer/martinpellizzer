                    <h1>Vaccinium viscifolium</h1>
<p>Vaccinium viscifolium, commonly known as the sticky leaved blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and blueberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. Its leaves are sticky to the touch due to the presence of glandular hairs, a characteristic that aids in water retention in its acidic, nutrient-poor soil habitat.</p>
<p>Vaccinium viscifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other wetland environments.</p>
