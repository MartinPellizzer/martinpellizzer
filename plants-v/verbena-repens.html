                    <h1>Verbena repens</h1>
<p>Verbena repens, commonly known as creeping verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Verbena repens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
