<p>Verbascum indicum, commonly known as Indian mullein, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties.</p>
<p>Verbascum indicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
