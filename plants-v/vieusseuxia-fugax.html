                    <h1>Vieusseuxia fugax</h1>
<p>Vieusseuxia fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
<p>Its elusive nature and striking appearance have made it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination.</p>
