<p>Vitis diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible, sour-tasting berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Vitis diversifolia is adapted to moist, wooded areas and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates.</p>
