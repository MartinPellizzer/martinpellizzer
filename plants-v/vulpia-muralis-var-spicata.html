                    <h1>Vulpia muralis var. spicata</h1>
<p>Vulpia muralis var. spicata, commonly known as the spicate wall grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in disturbed soils, such as those found along roadsides, waste areas, and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Vulpia muralis var. spicata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
