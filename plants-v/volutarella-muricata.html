                    <h1>Volutarella muricata</h1>
<p>Volutarella muricata, commonly known as the spiny sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny skin that provides defense against predators. The plant, though not a true plant, is a mollusk and lacks the typical plant structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it has a soft, gelatinous body with a muscular foot used for locomotion.</p>
<p>Volutarella muricata plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine animals.</p>
