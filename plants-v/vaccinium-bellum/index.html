                            <h1>Vaccinium Bellum</h1>
<p>Small blueberry, scientifically known as Vaccinium bellum, is a delicate wild shrub native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its tiny, bluish-purple berries that are both visually striking and highly prized for their unique flavor. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Despite its small size, Vaccinium bellum plays a vital role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals. Its presence highlights the biodiversity of native flora and the importance of preserving natural habitats.</p>
