                    <h1>Vittaria minor</h1>
<p>Vittaria minor, commonly known as the lesser tooth fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically less than 10 centimeters in length and have a soft, leathery texture. Vittaria minor thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
