                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bog bilberry, is a botanical variant of the bilberry species native to wet, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Vaccinium uliginosum. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in peat bogs and other nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance.</p>
