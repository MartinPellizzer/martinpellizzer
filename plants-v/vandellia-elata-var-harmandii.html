<p>Vandellia elata var. harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's vandellia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a striking combination of colors, typically with a white or pale pink base and vibrant red or orange markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its moist, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
