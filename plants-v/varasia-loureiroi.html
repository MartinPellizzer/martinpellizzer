<p>Varasia loureiroi, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
