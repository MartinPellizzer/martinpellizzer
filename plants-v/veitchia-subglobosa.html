                    <h1>Veitchia subglobosa</h1>
<p>Veitchia subglobosa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, robust trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
