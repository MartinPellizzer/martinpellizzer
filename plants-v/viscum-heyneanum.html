                    <h1>Viscum heyneanum</h1>
<p>Viscum heyneanum, commonly known as the tropical mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries and later excrete the seeds onto other host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum heyneanum is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
