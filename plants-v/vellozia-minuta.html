<p>Vellozia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Grewioideae and is characterized by its unique, spiny, and often woody structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Vellozia minuta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
