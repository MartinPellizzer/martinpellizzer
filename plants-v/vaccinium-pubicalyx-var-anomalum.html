<p>Vaccinium pubicalyx var. anomalum, commonly known as the irregular hairy blueberry, is a lesser-known variant of the Vaccinium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its berries are usually dark blue or black when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry varieties.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
