<p>Viscum cryptophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive pattern of veins.</p>
<p>Viscum cryptophlebium is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
