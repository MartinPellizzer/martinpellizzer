                            <h1>Viola Cucullata Var. Macrotis</h1>
<p>Crown violet, scientifically known as Viola cucullata var. macrotis, is a striking member of the Violaceae family native to North America. This perennial plant is recognized for its unique, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to woodland gardens. Its heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue petals make it a popular choice among horticulturists and nature enthusiasts. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest floors and along stream banks. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively uncommon in cultivated settings, making it a rare gem in the world of wildflowers.</p>
