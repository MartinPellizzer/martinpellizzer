                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. truncata</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf grape, is a lesser-known variant of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to standard Vitis vinifera varieties. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production. Its berries are small and less sweet than those of other grape varieties, making it less suitable for wine or table grapes.</p>
<p>Despite its limited agricultural use, it is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
