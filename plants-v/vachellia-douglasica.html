                    <h1>Vachellia douglasica</h1>
<p>Vachellia douglasica, commonly known as the Douglas's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, and it has a woody, thorny stem that helps it conserve water.</p>
<p>Vachellia douglasica is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
