<p>Viscum helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots of its own and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and elliptical in shape, often forming dense clusters on the host tree.</p>
<p>Viscum helferi is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate forest environments.</p>
