<p>Vitis heterophylla var. humulifolia, commonly known as the grapevines of the genus Vitis, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves resembling those of hops (Humulus lupulus), hence its name. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are usually alternate, with lobed or compound structures, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a dark blue or black color, often used in local foraging and traditional practices.</p>
