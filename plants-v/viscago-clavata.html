<p>Viscago clavata, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth pattern. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscago clavata is often found in temperate regions and can be a common sight in forested areas.</p>
