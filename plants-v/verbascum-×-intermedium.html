                    <h1>Verbascum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Verbascum × intermedium, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, velvety gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a spike-like cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from its resemblance to the common mullein (Verbascum thapsus), from which it was hybridized.</p>
