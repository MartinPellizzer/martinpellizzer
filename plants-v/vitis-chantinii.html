                    <h1>Vitis chantinii</h1>
<p>Vitis chantinii, commonly known as the Chantin's grape, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine belonging to the Vitaceae family, characterized by its tendrils and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red or black when mature. Vitis chantinii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in viticulture due to its low productivity and specific environmental requirements.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
