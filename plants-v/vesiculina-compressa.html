<p>Vesiculina compressa, commonly known as the compressed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for capturing tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Vesiculina compressa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
