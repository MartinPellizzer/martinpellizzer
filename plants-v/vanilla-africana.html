                    <h1>Vanilla africana</h1>
<p>Vanilla africana, commonly known as the African vanilla or West African vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin pods, which develop after successful pollination and contain the aromatic seeds used in vanilla extraction. The pods take several months to mature and require careful curing and drying to develop their characteristic flavor and aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific pollination requirements, Vanilla africana is less commercially cultivated compared to Vanilla planifolia.</p>
