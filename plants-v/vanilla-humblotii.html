                    <h1>Vanilla humblotii</h1>
<p>Vanilla humblotii, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by long, serpentine pods containing the aromatic vanilla beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its vanilla beans are prized for their distinct flavor profile, which is often described as more floral and less sweet than traditional vanilla.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vanilla humblotii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
