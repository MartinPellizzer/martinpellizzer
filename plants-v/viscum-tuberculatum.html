                    <h1>Viscum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Viscum tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum tuberculatum is native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
