<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
