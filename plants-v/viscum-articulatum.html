                    <h1>Viscum articulatum</h1>
<p>Viscum articulatum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its life cycle includes a dormant phase where the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries.</p>
<p>Viscum articulatum is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its ecological role in supporting wildlife.</p>
