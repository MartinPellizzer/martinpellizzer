                    <h1>Vesicaria edentula</h1>
<p>Vesicaria edentula, commonly known as the toothless bladder, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, hollow, bladder-like fruits.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>The species is named for its lack of teeth on the fruit valves, a feature that distinguishes it from closely related species.</p>
