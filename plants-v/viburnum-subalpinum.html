<p>Viburnum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Viburnum subalpinum is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold climates, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens.</p>
