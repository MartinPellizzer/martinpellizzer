                    <h1>Vera-duthiea salmonea</h1>
<p>Vera-duthiea salmonea, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Vera-duthiea salmonea is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
