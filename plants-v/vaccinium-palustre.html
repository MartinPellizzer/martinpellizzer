                    <h1>Vaccinium palustre</h1>
<p>Vaccinium palustre, commonly known as swamp blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic blue-black berries in the fall. These berries are not typically eaten by humans but are an important food source for wildlife such as birds and bears.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
