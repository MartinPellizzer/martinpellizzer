                    <h1>Vandellia ellobum</h1>
<p>Vandellia ellobum, commonly known as the green vandellia, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which help it blend into its natural surroundings. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, narrow leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its limited distribution and conservation status.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Vandellia ellobum is considered a critically endangered plant.</p>
