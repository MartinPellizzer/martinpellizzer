                    <h1>Vriesea spectabilis</h1>
<p>Vriesea spectabilis, commonly known as the Flame Flower, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a central rosette, creating a basin to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall flower spikes bearing bright orange or red bracts, which are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea spectabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
