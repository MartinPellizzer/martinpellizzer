                    <h1>Vriesea socialis</h1>
<p>Vriesea socialis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea socialis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
