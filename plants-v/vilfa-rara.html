                    <h1>Vilfa rara</h1>
<p>Vilfa rara, commonly known as the rare violet flower, is a delicate perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant purple flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Vilfa rara is considered an endangered species.</p>
