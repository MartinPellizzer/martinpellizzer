                    <h1>Viscago polygama</h1>
<p>Viscago polygama, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and produces small, white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy leaves and a woody stem that grows from the host tree. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Viscago polygama is often associated with festive traditions, particularly in Christmas celebrations.</p>
