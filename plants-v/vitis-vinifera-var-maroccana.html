<p>Vitis vinifera var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine.</p>

The plant produces small, intensely flavored berries that are used in local winemaking and traditional foods. Its vines are vigorous and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy choice for cultivation in challenging environments.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variety include thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, dark berries.</p>
