                    <h1>Verbascum bipinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Verbascum bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves with a distinctive bipinnatifid (twice pinnately divided) shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from its resemblance to the leaves of the traditional mullein plant, which is also used medicinally.</p>
