                    <h1>Veronica stricta var. lata</h1>
<p>Veronica stricta var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Veronica stricta, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
