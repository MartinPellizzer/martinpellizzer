                            <h1>Vitellaria Multiflora</h1>
<p>Vitellaria multiflora is a remarkable tree native to the savannas of West Africa. Known for its valuable seeds, it plays a crucial role in both local economies and ecosystems. This species is also referred to as shea tree or karite, and its fruit has been used for centuries in traditional practices. The tree thrives in dry climates and is highly resilient to environmental stress. Its significance extends beyond its economic value, as it supports biodiversity and soil conservation in its habitat.</p>
