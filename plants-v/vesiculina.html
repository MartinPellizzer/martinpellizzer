                    <h1>Vesiculina</h1>
<p>Vesiculina, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Vesiculina species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. They are carnivorous, relying on the captured prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology includes small, green leaves and specialized bladders that aid in both predation and buoyancy.</p>
