                    <h1>Verticordia amphigia</h1>
<p>Verticordia amphigia, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a striking member of the family Rhamnaceae, native to the southern regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the shoreline. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in the flora of its native habitat.</p>
