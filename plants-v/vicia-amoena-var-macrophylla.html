                    <h1>Vicia amoena var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Vicia amoena var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with broad, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
