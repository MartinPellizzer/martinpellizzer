                    <h1>Viburnum virens</h1>
<p>Viburnum virens, commonly known as the evergreen viburnum, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains vibrant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Viburnum virens thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
