<p>Vachellia walwalensis, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Vachellia walwalensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
