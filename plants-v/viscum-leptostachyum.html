                    <h1>Viscum leptostachyum</h1>
<p>Viscum leptostachyum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on coniferous trees such as pines and firs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to new host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host, often leading to reduced tree vigor.</p>
<p>Viscum leptostachyum is commonly found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in forests with suitable host species.</p>
