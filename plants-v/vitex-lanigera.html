<p>Vitex lanigera, commonly known as the silky ash or velvet ash, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Vitex lanigera is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
