                    <h1>Virga aspera</h1>
<p>Virga aspera, commonly known as the rough beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Virga aspera plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
