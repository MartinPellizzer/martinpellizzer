<p>Vaccinium sulcatum, commonly known as the scarlet huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are favored by both wildlife and humans for their tart, acidic flavor.</p>
<p>Vaccinium sulcatum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
