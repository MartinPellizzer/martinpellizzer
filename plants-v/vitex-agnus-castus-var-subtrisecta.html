                    <h1>Vitex agnus-castus var. subtrisecta</h1>
<p>Vitex agnus-castus var. subtrisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaste tree, is a variant of the chaste tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, three-lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lavender-blue flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly found in cultivation compared to the standard Vitex agnus-castus.</p>
