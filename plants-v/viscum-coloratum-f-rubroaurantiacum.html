<p>Viscum coloratum f. rubroaurantiacum, commonly known as the red-orange mistletoe, is a variant of the European mistletoe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and other broadleaf species. The plant's leaves are ovate and have a distinctive waxy coating, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. The fruit is a fleshy, red-orange berry that contains sticky seeds, aiding in its dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its vibrant coloration, which sets it apart from the more common green varieties of Viscum coloratum.</p>
