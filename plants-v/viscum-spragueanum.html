                    <h1>Viscum spragueanum</h1>
<p>Viscum spragueanum, commonly known as the Sprague's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces sticky berries that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new hosts. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum spragueanum is often found in temperate regions and is an important part of the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
