                    <h1>Vellozia neglecta</h1>
<p>Vellozia neglecta, commonly known as the slender vellozia, is a rare and striking member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in tight, cylindrical spikes, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vellozia neglecta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
