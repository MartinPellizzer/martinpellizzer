                    <h1>Vriesea burgeri</h1>
<p>Vriesea burgeri, commonly known as the Burger's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea burgeri is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
