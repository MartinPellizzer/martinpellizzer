<p>Persian speedwell, scientifically known as Veronica persica var. corrensiana, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the rocky soils of the Mediterranean region. With its delicate blue or violet flowers and low-growing habit, it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. This resilient species is often found in urban cracks and along coastal paths, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and floral arrangements. Despite its modest size, the Persian speedwell holds a special place in both horticultural and ecological contexts.</p>
