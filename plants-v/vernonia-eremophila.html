<p>Vernonia eremophila, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vernonia eremophila plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
