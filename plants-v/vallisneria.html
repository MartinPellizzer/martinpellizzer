<p>Vallisneria, commonly known as water celery, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the flowers submerged beneath the water. Vallisneria species are typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which help stabilize sediments and prevent erosion.</p>
