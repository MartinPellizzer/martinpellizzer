                    <h1>Vignea × haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Vignea × haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid vigna, is a rare and less-studied plant species within the legume family.</p>
<p>It exhibits morphological characteristics intermediate between its parent species, Vigna unguiculata and Vigna vexillata. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it holds potential for agricultural and botanical research.</p>
