                    <h1>Vanieria fruticosa</h1>
<p>Vanieria fruticosa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, knotted root system that forms a network beneath the water, aiding in soil stabilization and providing habitat for marine life. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. It produces yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, round fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Vanieria fruticosa plays a crucial role in protecting shorelines from erosion and maintaining the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
