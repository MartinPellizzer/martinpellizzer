                    <h1>Viscum zizyphi-mucronati</h1>
<p>Viscum zizyphi-mucronati, commonly known as the dwarf European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can cause significant stress to the tree over time.</p>
<p>Viscum zizyphi-mucronati is native to Europe and is often found in temperate forest environments.</p>
