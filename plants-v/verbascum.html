<p>Verbascum, commonly known as mullein, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. They are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are adapted to dry, rocky environments. Verbascum species are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for arid conditions.</p>
