<p>Vesicaria berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has broad, rounded leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, round fruits that contain buoyant seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
