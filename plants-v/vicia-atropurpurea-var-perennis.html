                    <h1>Vicia atropurpurea var. perennis</h1>
<p>Vicia atropurpurea var. perennis, commonly known as purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are typically hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
