                    <h1>Viscum venosum</h1>
<p>Viscum venosum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a distinctive, flat, disc-like structure. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum venosum is often found in temperate regions and has a long history of cultural and medicinal significance.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken its host tree over time, making it a subject of both ecological and traditional interest.</p>
