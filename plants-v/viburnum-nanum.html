<p>It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for hedges or foundation plantings.</p>
<p>Viburnum nanum thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
