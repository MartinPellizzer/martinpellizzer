<p>Vulpia grayi, commonly known as gray's vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Vulpia grayi is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
