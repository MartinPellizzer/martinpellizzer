                    <h1>Vandellia cowiei</h1>
<p>Vandellia cowiei, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, with each leaf being silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, wind-swept environment of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Vandellia cowiei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
