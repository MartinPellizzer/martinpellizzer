<p>Vitis hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's grape, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous climbing vine characterized by its palmate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically eaten by wildlife but are not considered edible by humans. Vitis hancockii thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
