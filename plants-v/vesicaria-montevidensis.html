<p>Vesicaria montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be partially above water.</p>
<p>Vesicaria montevidensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through insect capture.</p>
