<p>Vriesea splitgerberi, commonly known as the split-leaf vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, often with a distinctive split or fringed appearance. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea splitgerberi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
