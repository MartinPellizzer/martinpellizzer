<p>It belongs to the genus Verbascum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their large, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The hybrid form results from crosses between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum thapsus, leading to a plant with characteristics of both parents. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
