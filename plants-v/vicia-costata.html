                    <h1>Vicia costata</h1>
<p>Vicia costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, curved pods containing several seeds. Vicia costata is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
