<p>Vitis rutilans, commonly known as the golden vine, is a climbing plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Vitis rutilans is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, flowering vine.</p>
