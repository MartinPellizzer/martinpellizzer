                    <h1>Veronica nivalis</h1>
<p>Veronica nivalis, commonly known as the snow veronica, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments where the climate is cold and the growing season is short. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Veronica nivalis plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
