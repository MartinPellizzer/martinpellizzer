                    <h1>Vicia pallida f. paucifolia</h1>
<p>Vicia pallida f. paucifolia, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its reduced leaflet count.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its slender stems and sparse foliage make it distinct from the typical form of Vicia pallida.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
