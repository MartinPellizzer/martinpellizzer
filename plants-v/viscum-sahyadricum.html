<p>Viscum sahyadricum, commonly known as the Sahyadri mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as teak and neem, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Viscum sahyadricum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host trees and avian species.</p>
