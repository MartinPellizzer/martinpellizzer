                    <h1>Vernonia caput-medusae</h1>
<p>Vernonia caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or elephant's foot, is a striking African shrub characterized by its unique, spiky, and often branched structure.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its succulent-like leaves and deep root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals.</p>
