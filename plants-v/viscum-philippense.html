<p>Viscum philippense, commonly known as the Philippine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, fleshy structures. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum philippense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
