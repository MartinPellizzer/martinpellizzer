                    <h1>Viscum flabellifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum flabellifolium, commonly known as the fan-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Viscum flabellifolium relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
