                    <h1>Valerianella amarella</h1>
<p>Valerianella amarella, commonly known as dwarf valerian, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Valerianella amarella is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
