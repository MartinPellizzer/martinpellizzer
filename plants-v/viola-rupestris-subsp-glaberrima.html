<p>Viola rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous rock viola, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its rocky habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple, often with a yellow throat, during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
