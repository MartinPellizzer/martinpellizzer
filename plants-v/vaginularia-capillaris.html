<p>Vaginularia capillaris, commonly known as the feather boa sponge, is a marine sponge belonging to the family Spongiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, branching filaments that resemble a feather boa, giving it its common name. The sponge's body is composed of a soft, porous structure made up of a matrix of collagen fibers and spicules. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to substrates such as rocks or coral.</p>
<p>Vaginularia capillaris plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
