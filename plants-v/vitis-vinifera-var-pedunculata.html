<p>Vitis vinifera var. pedunculata, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and long, trailing vines that can reach considerable lengths. The plant produces small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found growing along rocky slopes or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in viticulture for its genetic diversity.</p>
