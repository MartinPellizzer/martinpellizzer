                    <h1>Veratrum tenuipetalum</h1>
<p>Veratrum tenuipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, stout stems that bear large, showy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its moist, forested habitat. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments.</p>
