<p>Vitis hypoglauca, commonly known as the Chinese grape or white grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of small, round berries that turn from yellow to dark purple as they mature. Vitis hypoglauca is adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
