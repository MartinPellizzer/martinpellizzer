<p>Vitis bellula var. pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent frost grape, is a rare and cold-hardy vine native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, frost-resistant berries and hairy, pubescent stems and leaves. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
