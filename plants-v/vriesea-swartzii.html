<p>Vriesea swartzii, commonly known as the Swartz's vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring a cluster of bright red flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup at the center. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea swartzii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
