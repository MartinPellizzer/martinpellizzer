                    <h1>Vernonia spelaeicola</h1>
<p>Vernonia spelaeicola, commonly known as the cave vernonia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the karstic caves of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant thrives in dark, humid environments with limited light, adapting to subterranean conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are pollinated by insects that can navigate the dimly lit cave interiors.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
