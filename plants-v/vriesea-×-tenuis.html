The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea × tenuis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
