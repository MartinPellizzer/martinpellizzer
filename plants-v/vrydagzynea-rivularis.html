<p>Vrydagzynea rivularis, commonly known as the river cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
