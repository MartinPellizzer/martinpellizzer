                    <h1>Viola fedtschenkoana var. muzaffarabadensis</h1>
<p>Viola fedtschenkoana var. muzaffarabadensis, commonly known as the Kashmir violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
