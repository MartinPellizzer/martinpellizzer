<p>Vincetoxicum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of showy, red berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets.</p>
<p>However, its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it a plant to be handled with care.</p>
