<p>Viorna viorna, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
