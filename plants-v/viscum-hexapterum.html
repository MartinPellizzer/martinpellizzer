<p>Viscum hexapterum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by birds. Its evergreen foliage remains throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance in winter.</p>
<p>Viscum hexapterum plays an important ecological role in supporting various bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
