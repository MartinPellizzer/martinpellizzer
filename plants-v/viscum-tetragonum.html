                    <h1>Viscum tetragonum</h1>
<p>Viscum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive four-angled stem and elliptical, waxy leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds. Viscum tetragonum is notable for its ability to derive water and some nutrients from its host, while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes indicate the health of the host tree and the ecosystem it inhabits.</p>
