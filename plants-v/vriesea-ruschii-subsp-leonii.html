<p>Vriesea ruschii subsp.</p>
<p>leonii, commonly known as the Leonii Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that ranges from red to orange, often with contrasting green or yellow veins.</p>
<p>The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its role as a bromeliad in tropical ecosystems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
