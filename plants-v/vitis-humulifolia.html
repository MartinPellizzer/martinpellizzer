                    <h1>Vitis humulifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis humulifolia, commonly known as the wild grape or river grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically blue-black in color when mature. Vitis humulifolia is often found along stream banks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its berries are edible but are generally not as flavorful or widely consumed as those of cultivated grape species.</p>
