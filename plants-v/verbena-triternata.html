                    <h1>Verbena triternata</h1>
<p>Verbena triternata, commonly known as coastal verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Verbena triternata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
