                    <h1>Vaccinium urnigerum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium urnigerum, commonly known as the urn bilberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, moist habitats such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cold, harsh environment.</p>
