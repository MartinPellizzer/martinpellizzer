                    <h1>Viola wulinfarmensis</h1>
<p>Viola wulinfarmensis, commonly known as the WÃ¼lin farm violet, is a rare and lesser-known species of violet native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, vibrant violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers have five petals, with a distinctive spur at the back, a feature common in many viola species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered plant.</p>
