<p>Vitis tinctoria, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in summer. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Vitis tinctoria is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine and for dyeing fabrics due to its pigments.</p>
