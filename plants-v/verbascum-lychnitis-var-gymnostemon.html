                    <h1>Verbascum lychnitis var. gymnostemon</h1>
<p>Verbascum lychnitis var. gymnostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical mullein. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower foliage compared to other Verbascum species.</p>
