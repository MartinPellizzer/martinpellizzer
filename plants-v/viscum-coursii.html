                    <h1>Viscum coursii</h1>
<p>Viscum coursii, commonly known as the Coursii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its leafy stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum coursii has a complex relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through a specialized root system called a haustellum.</p>
