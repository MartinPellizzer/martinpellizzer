<p>Viscum triflorum subsp.</p>
<p>nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its sticky seeds. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Malaysia. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth and health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
