<p>Vulpia sicula var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
