<p>Vaccaria perfoliata, commonly known as the sticky willow or devil's-bit scabious, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, typically blooming from June to August. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often fused at the base, creating a perfoliate appearance. Its stems are prostrate, creeping along the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Vaccaria perfoliata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in open landscapes and disturbed areas.</p>
