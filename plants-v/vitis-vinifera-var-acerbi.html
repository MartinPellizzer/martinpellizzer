                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. acerbi</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. acerbi, commonly known as the Italian grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are typically used in the production of high-quality wines. This variety thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, requiring a period of cold dormancy to produce fruit. The plant has deep roots that help it withstand drought conditions, and it is relatively resistant to some fungal diseases.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is primarily concentrated in Italy, where it contributes to the unique character of regional wines.</p>
