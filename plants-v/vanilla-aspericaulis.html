                    <h1>Vanilla aspericaulis</h1>
<p>Vanilla aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length, often growing along tree trunks or other supports. The plant's leaves are elliptical and covered with a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. It flowers with fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms that are typically not used for vanilla extraction.</p>
<p>The fruit, a curved pod, contains small, dark seeds and is rarely harvested for commercial use.</p>
