                    <h1>Viscum verrucosum</h1>
<p>Viscum verrucosum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>Viscum verrucosum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various wildlife species.</p>
