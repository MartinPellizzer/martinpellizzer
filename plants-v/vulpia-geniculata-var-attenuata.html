                    <h1>Vulpia geniculata var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Vulpia geniculata var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The variety *attenuata* is distinguished by its elongated, gradually tapering leaves compared to the more robust leaves of the typical *Vulpia geniculata*.</p>
