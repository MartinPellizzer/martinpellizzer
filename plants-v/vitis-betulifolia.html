                    <h1>Vitis betulifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis betulifolia, commonly known as the buckthorn grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the buckthorn plant, and its small, grape-like berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it climbs or scrambles through vegetation. Its botanical features include tendrils for climbing and a system of tendrils that help it grasp and support itself.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
