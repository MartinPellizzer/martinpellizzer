<p>Verbascum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic mullein, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical spike at the top of the stem. Its common name comes from its association with the Olympic Mountains in Greece, where it is found in rocky, alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Verbascum olympicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
