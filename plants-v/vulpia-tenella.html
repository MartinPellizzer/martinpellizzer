                    <h1>Vulpia tenella</h1>
<p>Vulpia tenella, commonly known as common vulpia, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often lie flat on the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, and the flowers are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Vulpia tenella is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
