                    <h1>Vittaria himalayensis var. elongata</h1>
<p>Vittaria himalayensis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated spikemoss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the Himalayan regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in dense, umbrella-like formations called strobili. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
