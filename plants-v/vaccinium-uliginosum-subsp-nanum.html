<p>Vaccinium uliginosum subsp.</p>
<p>nanum, commonly known as dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wet, acidic environments in the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to boggy soils and has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. Its berries, which are small and dark blue, are edible and often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
