                    <h1>Veitchia macdanielsii</h1>
<p>Veitchia macdanielsii, commonly known as the MacDaniels' cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
