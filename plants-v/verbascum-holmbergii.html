<p>Verbascum holmbergii, commonly known as Holmberg's mullein, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and also covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Holmberg's mullein is often found in dry, open habitats like rocky slopes and grasslands.</p>
