                    <h1>Vellozia argentea</h1>
<p>Vellozia argentea, commonly known as silver vellozia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, waxy leaf coatings that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Vellozia argentea is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in its native ecosystems.</p>
