                    <h1>Vanilla preussii</h1>
<p>Vanilla preussii, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive vanilla-like scent, which is a key feature in its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>While not used for vanilla flavoring like its relative Vanilla planifolia, it is valued in horticulture for its beauty and unique aroma.</p>
