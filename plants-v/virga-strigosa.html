                    <h1>Virga strigosa</h1>
<p>Virga strigosa, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are scale-like and tightly clustered, reducing surface area exposed to the sun.</p>
<p>Virga strigosa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and riparian habitats.</p>
