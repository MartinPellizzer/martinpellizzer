                    <h1>Viscum leucarpum</h1>
<p>Viscum leucarpum, commonly known as the white-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Viscum leucarpum is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it establishes itself through bird-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
