                    <h1>Vriesea ensiformis var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Vriesea ensiformis var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor bowersia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
