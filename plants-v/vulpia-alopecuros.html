                    <h1>Vulpia alopecuros</h1>
<p>Vulpia alopecuros, commonly known as the bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Vulpia alopecuros is often found in soils that are moderately fertile and well-drained.</p>
