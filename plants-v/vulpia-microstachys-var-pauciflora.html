                    <h1>Vulpia microstachys var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Vulpia microstachys var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender veldt grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
