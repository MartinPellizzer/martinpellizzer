<p>Vulpia membranacea subsp.</p>
<p>longiseta, commonly known as the long-hair fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
