                    <h1>Viscum pendulum</h1>
<p>Viscum pendulum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and poplars.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with glossy evergreen leaves and small white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces sticky, spherical berries that are a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Its root system, called a haustellum, attaches to the host tree and draws water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Viscum pendulum is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in many European countries.</p>
