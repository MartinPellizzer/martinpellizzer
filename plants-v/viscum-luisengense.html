<p>Viscum luisengense, commonly known as the Luisengense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis using its leaf-like structures. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum luisengense is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is noted for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
