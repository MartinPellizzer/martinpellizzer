                    <h1>Viscum cruciatum</h1>
<p>Viscum cruciatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with smooth, waxy leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, sticky berries that are a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum cruciatum is often associated with Christmas traditions and has cultural significance in many regions.</p>
