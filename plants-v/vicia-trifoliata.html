<p>Vicia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia trifoliata is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
