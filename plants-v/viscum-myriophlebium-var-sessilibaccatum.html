                    <h1>Viscum myriophlebium var. sessilibaccatum</h1>
<p>Viscum myriophlebium var. sessilibaccatum, commonly known as the sessile-fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of India and the Himalayas. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its fruits are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and contain sticky seeds that aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
