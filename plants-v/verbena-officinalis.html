<p>Verbena officinalis, commonly known as common verbena, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of blue, purple, and red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Verbena officinalis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Its flowers are also popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
