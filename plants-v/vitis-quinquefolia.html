<p>Vitis quinquefolia, commonly known as wild grape, is a deciduous vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically have five leaflets, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Vitis quinquefolia is also valued for its hardiness and is used in horticulture and as a rootstock for cultivated grape varieties.</p>
