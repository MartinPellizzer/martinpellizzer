<p>Vanda garayi, commonly known as the Garay's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Vanda garayi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
