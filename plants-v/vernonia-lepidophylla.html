                    <h1>Vernonia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Vernonia lepidophylla, commonly known as the "tree of life," is a unique succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Vernonia lepidophylla is also notable for its ability to curl into a compact ball when dry, a survival mechanism to conserve moisture.</p>
