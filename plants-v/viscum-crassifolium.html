                    <h1>Viscum crassifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its sticky seeds.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host via its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are toxic to many animals. It is native to parts of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken host trees over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging.</p>
