<p>Volkmannia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its terrestrial or epiphytic growth habit and produces showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have linear or strap-shaped leaves and are adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Volkmannia species are native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, and are often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them interesting subjects for botanical study.</p>
