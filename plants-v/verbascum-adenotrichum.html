<p>Verbascum adenotrichum, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Verbascum adenotrichum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
