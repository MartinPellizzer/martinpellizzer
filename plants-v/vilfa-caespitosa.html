                    <h1>Vilfa caespitosa</h1>
<p>Vilfa caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or creeping violet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or clumps, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Vilfa caespitosa is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
