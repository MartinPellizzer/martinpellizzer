<p>Vinca minor var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple heart vinca, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective weed suppressor in woodland gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
