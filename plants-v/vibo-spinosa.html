<p>Vibo spinosa, commonly known as the spiny vibora, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Vibo spinosa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
