                    <h1>Vestigium</h1>
<p>Vestigium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant with unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, almost ethereal petals that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are small and succulent, adapted to store water in arid climates. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait linked to its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Vestigium is extremely elusive, with limited documented sightings in the wild.</p>
