                    <h1>Vigna comosa</h1>
<p>Vigna comosa, commonly known as the hairy bean or woolly cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Vigna comosa is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often used as a forage crop or for soil improvement.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in sustainable agricultural systems.</p>
