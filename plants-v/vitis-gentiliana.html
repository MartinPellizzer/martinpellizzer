                    <h1>Vitis gentiliana</h1>
<p>Vitis gentiliana, commonly known as the wild grape or Italian grape, is a species of flowering vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red in some varieties. Vitis gentiliana is often found growing along riverbanks and in woodland areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
