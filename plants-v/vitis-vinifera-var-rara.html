<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf shape and small, dark purple berries that are typically used in niche winemaking. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its limited cultivation makes it a subject of interest for botanists and viticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized vineyards or botanical gardens.</p>
