<p>Vicia angulosa, commonly known as narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Vicia angulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
