                    <h1>Vignea × filkukae</h1>
<p>Vignea × filkukae, commonly known as the hybrid grapevine, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) and Vigna sinensis (yardlong bean).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including vigorous growth and the ability to produce elongated pods. The plant is typically herbaceous, with compound leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are edible, containing seeds that can be used for propagation.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in improving crop resilience and yield.</p>
