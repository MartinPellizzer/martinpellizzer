                    <h1>Viola sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Viola sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and purple or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat.</p>
