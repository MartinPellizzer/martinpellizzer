                    <h1>Vanda saprophytica</h1>
<p>Vanda saprophytica, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with a unique coloration that ranges from white to deep purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Vanda saprophytica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its blooming period is rare, often occurring only once every few years, making it a highly sought-after specimen in botanical gardens.</p>
