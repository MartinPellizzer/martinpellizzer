                    <h1>Vanilla palmarum</h1>
<p>Vanilla palmarum, commonly known as the palmate vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its characteristic vanilla pods. These pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are used in the extraction of vanilla flavoring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a support structure for its climbing growth.</p>
