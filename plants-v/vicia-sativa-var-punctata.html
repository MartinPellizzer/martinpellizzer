                    <h1>Vicia sativa var. punctata</h1>
<p>Vicia sativa var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a cover crop.</p>
<p>The varietal name "punctata" refers to the small, black spots on its leaves, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
