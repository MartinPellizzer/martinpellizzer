                    <h1>Vicia alternans</h1>
<p>Vicia alternans, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often as a weed in agricultural areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Vicia alternans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
