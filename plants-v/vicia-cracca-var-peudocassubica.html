                    <h1>Vicia cracca var. peudocassubica</h1>
<p>Vicia cracca var. peudocassubica, commonly known as the false vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability. It produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than other vetch species but is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
