                    <h1>Vicia tenuifolia var. humilior</h1>
<p>Vicia tenuifolia var. humilior, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a low-growing legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
