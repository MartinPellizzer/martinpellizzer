                    <h1>Vanilla bertoniensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla bertoniensis, commonly known as the African vanilla or Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-brown pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pods are harvested when mature and dried to develop the characteristic vanilla flavor.</p>
<p>This species is highly valued in the vanilla industry for its rich aroma and is often used in perfumes and culinary applications.</p>
