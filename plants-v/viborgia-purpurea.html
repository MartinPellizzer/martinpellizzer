                    <h1>Viborgia purpurea</h1>
<p>Viborgia purpurea, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Viborgia purpurea is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
