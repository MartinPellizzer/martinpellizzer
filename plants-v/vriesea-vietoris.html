<p>Vriesea vietoris, commonly known as the Vietnamese Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect and retain water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea vietoris is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
