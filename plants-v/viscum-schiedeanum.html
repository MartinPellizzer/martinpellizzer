<p>Viscum schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiede's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Viscum schiedeanum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of the host tree.</p>
