                    <h1>Vappodes phalaenopsis</h1>
<p>Vappodes phalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale purple flowers that resemble those of the Phalaenopsis genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
