                    <h1>Valerianella pumila</h1>
<p>Valerianella pumila, commonly known as mouse barley or small valerian, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, usually from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and meadows.</p>
<p>Valerianella pumila is often found in dry, sunny areas and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
