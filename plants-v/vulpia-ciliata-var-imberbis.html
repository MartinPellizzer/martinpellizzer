                    <h1>Vulpia ciliata var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Vulpia ciliata var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless vulpia, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that lack the hairy texture typical of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and rapid growth, it is considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
