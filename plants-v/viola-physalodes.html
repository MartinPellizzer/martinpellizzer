                    <h1>Viola physalodes</h1>
<p>Viola physalodes, commonly known as the Crown Vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Its fibrous root system makes it effective for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>Viola physalodes is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
