                            <h1>Viscaria Vulgaris Subsp. Atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Viscaria vulgaris subsp. atropurpurea is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family known for its vibrant purple and pink flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance that adds texture to any landscape. The subspecies is often confused with its close relative, Viscaria vulgaris, but it can be distinguished by its deeper, more intense coloration. With its compact growth habit and long blooming season, it is a versatile and eye-catching addition to gardens.</p>
