                    <h1>Vitis trifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Vitis trifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses.</p>
