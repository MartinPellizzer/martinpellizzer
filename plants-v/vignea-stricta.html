<p>Vignea stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits, posing a risk to both animals and humans. Vignea stricta thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid regions.</p>
