                    <h1>Vignea cuprina</h1>
<p>Vignea cuprina, commonly known as the black bean aphid, is a small, soft-bodied insect that feeds on the sap of plants, particularly legumes like beans and peas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black coloration, which helps it blend with the foliage of its host plants. The plant's botanical aspects are primarily related to its role as a host for this pest, with its leaves and stems providing the necessary nutrients for the aphids to thrive. Vignea cuprina does not have any direct botanical significance itself but is closely associated with the leguminous plants it infests.</p>
<p>Its presence can significantly impact the growth and yield of these crops.</p>
