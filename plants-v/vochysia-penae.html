                    <h1>Vochysia penae</h1>
<p>Vochysia penae, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Vochysia penae is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
