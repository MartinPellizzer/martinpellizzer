<p>Vulpia sciuroides var. broteri, commonly known as the dwarf false brome, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for soil stabilization.</p>
