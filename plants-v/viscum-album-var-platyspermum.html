                    <h1>Viscum album var. platyspermum</h1>
<p>Viscum album var. platyspermum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oak and apple.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is associated with traditional folklore.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of suitable host trees.</p>
