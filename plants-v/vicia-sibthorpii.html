                    <h1>Vicia sibthorpii</h1>
<p>Vicia sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by slender, twisted pods. Vicia sibthorpii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system.</p>
