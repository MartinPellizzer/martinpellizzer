                    <h1>Viscum incanum var. aureum</h1>
<p>Viscum incanum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically orange-red in color. It is often found in temperate climates and can be a common sight in woodlands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it derives its nutrients from the host tree, which can sometimes lead to weakened growth in the host.</p>
