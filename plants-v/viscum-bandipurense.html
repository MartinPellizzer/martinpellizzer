                    <h1>Viscum bandipurense</h1>
<p>Viscum bandipurense, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Viscum bandipurense is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dense forests.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive moisture and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
