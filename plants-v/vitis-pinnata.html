                    <h1>Vitis pinnata</h1>
<p>Vitis pinnata, commonly known as the prickly vine or sand grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, sour-tasting berries. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an aggressive weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Vitis pinnata is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in open fields.</p>
