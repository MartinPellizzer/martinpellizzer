<p>Vilfa stachydantha, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
