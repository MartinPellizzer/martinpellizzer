                    <h1>Veronica divaricata</h1>
<p>Veronica divaricata, commonly known as the spreading speedwell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Veronica divaricata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
