<p>Vanheerdea roodiae, commonly known as the Red Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
