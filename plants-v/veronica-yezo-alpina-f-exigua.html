                    <h1>Veronica yezo-alpina f. exigua</h1>
<p>Veronica yezo-alpina f. exigua, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
