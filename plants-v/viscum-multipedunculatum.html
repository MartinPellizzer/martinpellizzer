                    <h1>Viscum multipedunculatum</h1>
<p>Viscum multipedunculatum, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum multipedunculatum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
