<p>Vernonia zambiana, commonly known as the Zambian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, while its roots are deep and strong, making it drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Vernonia zambiana is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
