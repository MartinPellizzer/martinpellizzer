                    <h1>Verbascum × pseudomaurum</h1>
<p>Verbascum × pseudomaurum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum xanthifolium.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showcasing robust stems and large, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it a notable example of plant hybridization.</p>
