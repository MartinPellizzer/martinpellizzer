                    <h1>Virola nobilis</h1>
<p>Virola nobilis, commonly known as the "Amazonian rosewood," is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiky fruits containing edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable to extinction.</p>
