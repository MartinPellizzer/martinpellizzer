                    <h1>Vachellia harmandiana</h1>
<p>Vachellia harmandiana, commonly known as the Harmand's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow globular flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Vachellia harmandiana plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance is significant in desert ecosystems where it provides habitat and forage for wildlife.</p>
