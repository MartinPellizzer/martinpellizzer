                    <h1>Vriesea saxicola</h1>
<p>Vriesea saxicola, commonly known as the rock vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea saxicola is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
