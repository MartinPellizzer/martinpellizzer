<p>Vicioides hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid vicia, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple.

Vicioides hybrida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
