<p>Vincetoxicum vincetoxicum, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems.

<p>Vincetoxicum vincetoxicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and showy flowers.</p>
