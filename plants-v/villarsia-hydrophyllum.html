<p>Villarsia hydrophyllum, commonly known as the water villarsia, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, and its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
