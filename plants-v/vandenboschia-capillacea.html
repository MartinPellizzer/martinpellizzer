<p>Vandenboschia capillacea, commonly known as the Cape hairveld, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Vandenboschia capillacea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
