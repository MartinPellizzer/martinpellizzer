<p>Vincetoxicum greggii, commonly known as Gregg's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in desert regions.</p>
<p>Gregg's milkweed plays a role in supporting local insect populations, though it is not a primary host for monarch butterflies.</p>
