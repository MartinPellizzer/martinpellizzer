                    <h1>Victoria cruziana</h1>

<p>It is characterized by its enormous, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that prevents water from seeping through, allowing the plant to float. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
