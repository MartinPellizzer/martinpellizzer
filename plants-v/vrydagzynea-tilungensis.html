<p>Vrydagzynea tilungensis, commonly known as the Tilungensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
