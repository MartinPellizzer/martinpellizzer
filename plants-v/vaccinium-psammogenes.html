                    <h1>Vaccinium psammogenes</h1>
<p>Vaccinium psammogenes, commonly known as the sand heath blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It produces small, edible berries that are typically blue or black in color, similar to other Vaccinium species. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Vaccinium psammogenes make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
