                <h1>Vilfa patula</h1>
<p>Vilfa patula, commonly known as the Mexican devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid landscapes.</p>
