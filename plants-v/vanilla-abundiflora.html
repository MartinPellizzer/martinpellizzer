                    <h1>Vanilla abundiflora</h1>
<p>Vanilla abundiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian vanilla or the common vanilla, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent. Its fruit, a dark purple pod, contains the seeds used in vanilla extraction, though it is not as commercially valuable as vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a trellis for support as it climbs.</p>
