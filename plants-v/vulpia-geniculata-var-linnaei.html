<p>Vulpia geniculata var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific value.</p>
