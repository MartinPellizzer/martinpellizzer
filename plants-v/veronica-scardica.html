<p>Veronica scardica, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Veronica scardica is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
