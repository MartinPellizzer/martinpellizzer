                    <h1>Vaccinium conchophyllum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium conchophyllum, commonly known as the shell-leaf cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many species of heathers and cranberries. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its often-saline habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in taste to true cranberries.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with high humidity and salt spray.</p>
