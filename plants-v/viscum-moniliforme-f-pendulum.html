                    <h1>Viscum moniliforme f. pendulum</h1>
<p>Viscum moniliforme f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its drooping, pendulous growth habit. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white, clustered flowers. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesis provides some of its own energy.</p>
<p>This unique growth form makes it a striking addition to forest canopies.</p>
