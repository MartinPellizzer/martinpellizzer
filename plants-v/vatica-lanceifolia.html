                    <h1>Vatica lanceifolia</h1>
<p>Vatica lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and robust, hardy wood that is highly valued in construction and furniture-making. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a conservation priority in its native habitats.</p>
