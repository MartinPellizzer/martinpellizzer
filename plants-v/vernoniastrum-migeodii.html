                <h1>Vernoniastrum migeodii</h1>
<p>Vernoniastrum migeodii, commonly known as the Migeod's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are orange-red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
