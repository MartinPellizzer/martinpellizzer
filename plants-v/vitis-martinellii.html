                    <h1>Vitis martinellii</h1>
<p>Vitis martinellii, commonly known as Martinelli's grapevine, is a rare and less-studied species within the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. The plant is characterized by its woody vines, which can climb to considerable heights, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically dark purple or black when mature, and the leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis martinellii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
