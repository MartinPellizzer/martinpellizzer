<p>Vittaria remota, commonly known as the remote maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Vittariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Vittaria remota thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
