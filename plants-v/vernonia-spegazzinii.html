                    <h1>Vernonia spegazzinii</h1>
<p>Vernonia spegazzinii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Vernonia spegazzinii is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
