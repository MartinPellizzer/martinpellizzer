                    <h1>Vicia sepium var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Vicia sepium var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy trefoil, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows, waste areas, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
