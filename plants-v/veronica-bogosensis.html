<p>Veronica bogosensis, commonly known as the Bogosian speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Veronica bogosensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
