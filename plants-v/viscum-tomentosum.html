<p>Viscum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for some bird species. Viscum tomentosum relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides shelter and food for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of host trees.</p>
