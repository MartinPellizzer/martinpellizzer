<p>Vriesea billbergioides var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked-leaf vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, long, strap-like leaves that are often bare or minimally covered with trichomes, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
