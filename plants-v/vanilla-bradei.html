<p>Vanilla bradei, commonly known as the Bornean vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves.

These beans are harvested and used in the same way as traditional vanilla, though they are less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species within the orchid family.</p>
