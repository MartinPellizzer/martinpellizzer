<p>Vicia tetrasperma subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its pods are slender and contain several small, rounded seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
