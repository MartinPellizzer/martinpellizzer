                    <h1>Viscum cuneifolium var. demissum</h1>
<p>Viscum cuneifolium var. demissum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests coniferous trees such as pines and firs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures that attach to the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle involves wind-dispersed seeds that germinate on the foliage of host trees.</p>
