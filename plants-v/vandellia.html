                    <h1>Vandellia</h1>
<p>Vandellia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Vandellia is known for its unique growth habit, often growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
