                    <h1>Vicia variegata</h1>
<p>Vicia variegata, commonly known as the spotted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base, with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. Vicia variegata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration and soil enrichment.</p>
