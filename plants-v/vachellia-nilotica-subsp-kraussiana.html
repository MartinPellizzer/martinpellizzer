<p>Vachellia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>kraussiana, commonly known as the Krauss acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
