                    <h1>Vanda tricolor var. planilabris</h1>
<p>Vanda tricolor var. planilabris, commonly known as the flat-labied vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, tricolor flowers with a distinctive flat lip, which is a key identifying characteristic. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
