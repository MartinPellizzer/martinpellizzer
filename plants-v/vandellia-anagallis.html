                    <h1>Vandellia anagallis</h1>
<p>Vandellia anagallis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, which allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Vandellia anagallis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
