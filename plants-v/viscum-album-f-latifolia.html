                    <h1>Viscum album f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Viscum album f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It possesses broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by berries containing sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, facilitating the plant's spread.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time if left unchecked.</p>
