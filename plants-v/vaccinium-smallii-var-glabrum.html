                    <h1>Vaccinium smallii var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium smallii var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, give way to edible berries that are smaller and less sweet than those of other Vaccinium species.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the species.</p>
