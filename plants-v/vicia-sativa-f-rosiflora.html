<p>Vicia sativa f. rosiflora, commonly known as the pink vetch, is a botanical variant of the common vetch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers, which contrast with the typical green or yellow blooms of the standard species. The plant is an annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its trifoliate leaves and slender, branching stems are typical of the Vicia genus.</p>
