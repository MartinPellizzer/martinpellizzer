                    <h1>Viscum clavatum</h1>
<p>Viscum clavatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum clavatum is often associated with winter and holiday traditions, particularly in European cultures.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds, which then germinate on new host trees.</p>
