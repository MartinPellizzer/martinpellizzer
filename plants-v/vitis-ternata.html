                    <h1>Vitis ternata</h1>
<p>Vitis ternata, commonly known as the creeping grape or Japanese climbing vine, is a perennial vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of black, edible berries. Vitis ternata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
