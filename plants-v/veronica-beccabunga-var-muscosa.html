<p>Veronica beccabunga var. muscosa, commonly known as the marsh speedwell, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
