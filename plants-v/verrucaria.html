                    <h1>Verrucaria</h1>
<p>Verrucaria, commonly known as the "sponge-like lichen," is a genus of foliose lichens characterized by their thallus structure that resembles a sponge or a crust.</p>
<p>These lichens are typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or decaying wood in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is composed of a network of hyphae that form a dense, irregularly branched layer. Verrucaria species are often covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving them a distinctive, uneven appearance.</p>
<p>They are chemically diverse, producing various secondary metabolites that contribute to their ecological roles and interactions with the environment.</p>
