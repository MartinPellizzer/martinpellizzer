                    <h1>Vicia communis var. pseudoangustifolia</h1>
<p>Vicia communis var. pseudoangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, often trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. The seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a distinctive, twisted form.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
