                    <h1>Viscum antarcticum</h1>
<p>Viscum antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of southern beech trees in South America.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by berries that are toxic to many animals. Its roots penetrate the host tree's bark to absorb water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis using its own leaves.</p>
<p>Viscum antarcticum is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a unique role in the ecosystems of its native range.</p>
