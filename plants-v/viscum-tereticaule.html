                    <h1>Viscum tereticaule</h1>
<p>Viscum tereticaule, commonly known as the slender European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system consists of haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Viscum tereticaule is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
