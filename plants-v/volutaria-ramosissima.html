<p>Volutaria ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some regions.</p>
