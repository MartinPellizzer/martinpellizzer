<p>Vachellia planifrons, commonly known as the flat-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of small, paired leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Vachellia planifrons is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
