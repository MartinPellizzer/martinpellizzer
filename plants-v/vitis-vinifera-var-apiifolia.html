                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. apiifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. apiifolia, commonly known as the Apiifolia grape, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of the carrot plant, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, sour tasting berries that are not typically used for winemaking. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists.</p>
