<p>Viola sequeirae, commonly known as the Sequeira violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Portugal.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with heart-shaped, velvety leaves and delicate, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing small, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Viola sequeirae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
