<p>Veratrum maackii var. iyoense, commonly known as the Iyoense white hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
