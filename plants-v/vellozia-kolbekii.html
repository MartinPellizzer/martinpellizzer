                    <h1>Vellozia kolbekii</h1>
<p>Vellozia kolbekii, commonly known as the Kolbek's vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Grewioideae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Vellozia kolbekii is adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
