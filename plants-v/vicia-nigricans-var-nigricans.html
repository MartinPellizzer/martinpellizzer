                    <h1>Vicia nigricans var. nigricans</h1>
<p>Vicia nigricans var. nigricans, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods and are often used as forage or in soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>This species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
