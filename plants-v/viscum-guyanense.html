<p>Viscum guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of various host trees, such as those in the Fabaceae and Myrtaceae families, using its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum guyanense plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
