                    <h1>Vriesea goniorachis</h1>
<p>Vriesea goniorachis, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange bracts that resemble a torch, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length. It produces small white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Vriesea goniorachis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
