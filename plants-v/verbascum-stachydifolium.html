                    <h1>Verbascum stachydifolium</h1>
<p>Verbascum stachydifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves that cover the stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative properties.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
