                    <h1>Vicia oreophila</h1>
<p>Vicia oreophila, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Vicia oreophila thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
