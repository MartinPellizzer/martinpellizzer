<p>Viscum gracile, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of coniferous trees, such as firs and pines, and derives its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are scale-like and often appear in clusters, while its flowers are inconspicuous and greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Viscum gracile plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and structure of its host trees.</p>
