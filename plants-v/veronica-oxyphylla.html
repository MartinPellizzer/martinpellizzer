<p>Veronica oxyphylla, commonly known as the mountain veronica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Veronica oxyphylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
