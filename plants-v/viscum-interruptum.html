                    <h1>Viscum interruptum</h1>
<p>Viscum interruptum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance called viscin. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum interruptum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to the death of the host tree over time.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed across Europe and has been historically associated with various cultural and mythological traditions.</p>
