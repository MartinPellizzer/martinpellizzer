                    <h1>Viscum obscurum</h1>
<p>Viscum obscurum, commonly known as the obscure mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum obscurum is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
