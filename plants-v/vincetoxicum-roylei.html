                    <h1>Vincetoxicum roylei</h1>
<p>Vincetoxicum roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Vincetoxicum roylei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though caution is advised due to the toxicity of its berries.</p>
