                    <h1>Verbascum linguifolium</h1>
<p>Verbascum linguifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are large, broad, and often heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other mullein species. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
