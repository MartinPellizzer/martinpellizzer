                    <h1>Viscum squamigerum</h1>
<p>Viscum squamigerum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense, scaly layer. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by birds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Viscum squamigerum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
