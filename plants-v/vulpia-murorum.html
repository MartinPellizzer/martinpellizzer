<p>Vulpia murorum, commonly known as mouse-ear grass, is a small annual grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and prefers dry, sandy or gravelly habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Vulpia murorum is adapted to thrive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and widespread plant in its native range.</p>
