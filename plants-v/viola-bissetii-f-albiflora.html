                    <h1>Viola bissetii f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Viola bissetii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered violet, is a rare and striking variant of the viola genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white or very light lavender flowers, which contrast with its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in southern France and northern Italy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
