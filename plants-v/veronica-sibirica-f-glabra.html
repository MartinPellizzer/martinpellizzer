                    <h1>Veronica sibirica f. glabra</h1>
<p>Veronica sibirica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth siberian speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the colder regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features slender stems that often lie close to the ground, producing clusters of small, blue to purple flowers throughout the summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabra' form is notable for its smooth, hairless surface. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
