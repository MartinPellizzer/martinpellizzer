                    <h1>Vignea × rotae</h1>
<p>Vignea × rotae, commonly known as the hybrid sweet potato, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Ipomoea trifida (taro).</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a starchy, edible tuberous root and a leaf structure similar to taro. The plant is typically cultivated for its nutrient-rich tubers, which are a staple food in many tropical regions. Vignea × rotae thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, loamy soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical classification places it within the Convolvulaceae family, sharing traits with other members of the genus Vignea.</p>
