                    <h1>Veitchia arecina</h1>
<p>Veitchia arecina, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which can grow up to 5 meters in length, and its large, clustered inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers. The plant produces oval, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed, which is used to propagate new plants. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in coastal areas.</p>
<p>The coconut palm is also valued for its economic contributions, including the production of coconuts, palm oil, and other by-products.</p>
