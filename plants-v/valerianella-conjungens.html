                    <h1>Valerianella conjungens</h1>
<p>Valerianella conjungens, commonly known as mouse whiskers, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are finely divided, resembling the whiskers of a mouse. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It has a creeping habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily.</p>
<p>Valerianella conjungens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
