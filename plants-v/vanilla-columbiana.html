                    <h1>Vanilla columbiana</h1>
<p>Vanilla columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian vanilla, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its natural habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its elongated, wrinkled pods, which develop after successful pollination. These pods contain aromatic seeds surrounded by a sweet, aromatic pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination requirements, Vanilla columbiana is less commonly cultivated than other vanilla species.</p>
