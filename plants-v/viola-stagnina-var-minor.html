                    <h1>Viola stagnina var. minor</h1>
<p>Viola stagnina var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water violet, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, often boggy habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 cm, with heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic soils and its ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
