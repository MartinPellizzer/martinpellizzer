<p>Villarrealia, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across forest floors.</p>
<p>Villarrealia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
