                    <h1>Vachellia cookii</h1>
<p>Vachellia cookii, commonly known as the Cook's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Vachellia cookii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
