<p>Vernonia ilex, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Vernonia ilex is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
