                    <h1>Viscum goetzei</h1>
<p>Viscum goetzei, commonly known as the Goetz's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum goetzei is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it a significant ecological factor in its habitat.</p>
