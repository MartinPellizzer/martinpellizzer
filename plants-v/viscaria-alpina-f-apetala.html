                    <h1>Viscaria alpina f. apetala</h1>
<p>Viscaria alpina f. apetala, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, basal leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its flowers are often reduced or absent in this particular form, which is a distinguishing feature of the apetala variant.</p>
<p>This botanical trait may be an adaptation to specific environmental pressures, such as limited pollination opportunities in high-altitude regions.</p>
