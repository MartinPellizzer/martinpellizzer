<p>Villocuspis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching stems that exhibit a zigzag or sinuous growth pattern, which helps it conserve water and withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Villocuspis flexuosa is well adapted to its environment, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the cactus family.</p>
