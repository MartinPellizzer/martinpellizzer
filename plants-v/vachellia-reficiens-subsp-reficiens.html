<p>Vachellia reficiens subsp.</p>
<p>reficiens, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features slender, often twisted branches and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant has bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots and a capacity for nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and sometimes used locally for fuel or minor construction purposes.</p>
