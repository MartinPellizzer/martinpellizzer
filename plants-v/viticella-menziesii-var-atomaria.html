                    <h1>Viticella menziesii var. atomaria</h1>
<p>Viticella menziesii var. atomaria, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is native to the western United States and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and role in forest ecosystems.</p>
