                    <h1>Vicia villosa var. eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Vicia villosa var. eriocarpa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated, bean-shaped pods. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Vicia villosa var. eriocarpa is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
