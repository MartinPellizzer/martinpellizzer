                            <h1>Viola Palustroides</h1>
<p>Viola palustroides, also known as the swamp violet, is a delicate flowering plant native to wetland habitats across eastern North America. This perennial species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, swamps, and woodland edges. Its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant violet flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to its often-overlooked habitat. The plant plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Despite its beauty, Viola palustroides remains underappreciated and threatened by habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
