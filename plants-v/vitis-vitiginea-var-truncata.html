<p>Vitis vitiginea var. truncata, commonly known as the sandbar grape, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in wet, sandy soils near waterways and is often found along riverbanks and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
