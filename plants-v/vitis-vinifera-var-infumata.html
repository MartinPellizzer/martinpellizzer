<p>Vitis vinifera var. infumata, commonly known as the dark red grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of more widely cultivated varieties. The plant exhibits vigorous growth and is often found in regions with a temperate climate. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the vines can reach considerable lengths.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration and flavor profile, it is occasionally used in niche wine production and culinary applications.</p>
