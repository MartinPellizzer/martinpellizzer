                    <h1>Viola phalacrocarpa f. pallescens</h1>
<p>Viola phalacrocarpa f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale viola, is a botanical variant of the common violet, characterized by its pale greenish-yellow foliage and smaller, less intensely colored flowers compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and blooms with violet flowers that have a subtle fragrance. Its flowers typically open in spring and are visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The pale viola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
