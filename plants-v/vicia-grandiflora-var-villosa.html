                    <h1>Vicia grandiflora var. villosa</h1>
<p>Vicia grandiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it its varietal name, and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is characterized by its stout, climbing stems and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
