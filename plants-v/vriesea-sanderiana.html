                    <h1>Vriesea sanderiana</h1>
<p>Vriesea sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous bracts that come in shades of orange, red, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its inflorescence typically emerges from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Vriesea sanderiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
