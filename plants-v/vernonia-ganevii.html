<p>Vernonia ganevii, commonly known as the Ganev's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Vernonia ganevii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
