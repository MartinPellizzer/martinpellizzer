                    <h1>Vicia purpurea</h1>
<p>Vicia purpurea, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of purple or violet pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions.</p>
<p>Vicia purpurea is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in fields, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.</p>
