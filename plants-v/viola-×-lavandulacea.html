                    <h1>Viola × lavandulacea</h1>
<p>Viola × lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender viola, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Viola wittrockii and Viola lutea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily propagated through seed or cuttings.</p>
