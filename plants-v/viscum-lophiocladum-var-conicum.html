                    <h1>Viscum lophiocladum var. conicum</h1>
<p>Viscum lophiocladum var. conicum, commonly known as the conic mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white berries. The plant produces sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new hosts. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying parasitic plant ecology and host-specific relationships.</p>
