                    <h1>Vicia fagonii</h1>
<p>Vicia fagonii, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, oval leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Vicia fagonii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
