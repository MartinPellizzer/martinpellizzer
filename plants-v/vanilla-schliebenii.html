                    <h1>Vanilla schliebenii</h1>
<p>Vanilla schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that are similar in appearance to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. The plant has long, slender stems that twine around supporting structures as it grows. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and often go unnoticed despite their role in the reproductive cycle of the plant.</p>
