                    <h1>Viscum laxum var. albescens</h1>
<p>Viscum laxum var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its sticky seeds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its pale green to white foliage. The plant derives most of its nutrients from its host, while photosynthesis occurs to a lesser extent. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical Viscum laxum and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
