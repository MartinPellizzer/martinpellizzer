                    <h1>Viscum microphyllum</h1>
<p>Viscum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of various coniferous trees, such as pines, firs, and spruces, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds. Viscum microphyllum is native to the northern hemisphere and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it can live for many years, forming dense clusters on its host trees.</p>
