<p>Vanilla majaijensis, commonly known as the East African vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the highlands of Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species, making it unique among vanilla species. The plant's vines can grow up to several meters long, often climbing trees or shrubs in its natural habitat. Its fruit, a dark brown pod, contains aromatic seeds used in culinary and perfumery applications.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Vanilla majaijensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
