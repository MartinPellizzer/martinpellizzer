                    <h1>Valeriana officinalis var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Valeriana officinalis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, often pleasant fragrance due to the presence of volatile oils in its roots and stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the common valerian, and has been used traditionally for its calming effects.</p>
