<p>Vernonia declivium, commonly known as the cliff vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Vernonia declivium is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
