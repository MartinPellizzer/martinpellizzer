                    <h1>Vanilla borneensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla borneensis, commonly known as Bornean vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most notable feature is its long, curved pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pods are harvested and cured to develop the characteristic vanilla flavor.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique aroma and is used in both culinary and aromatic applications.</p>
