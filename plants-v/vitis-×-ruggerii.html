<p>Vitis × ruggerii, commonly known as the ruggeri grape, is a hybrid vine species resulting from the cross between Vitis vinifera and Vitis riparia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it suitable for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant produces small, often sour-tasting berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are used in some local traditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a coarsely serrated margin, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Vitis × ruggerii is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at developing disease-resistant grape varieties.</p>
