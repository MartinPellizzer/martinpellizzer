                    <h1>Verbascum xanthophoeniceum var. eriocarpum</h1>
<p>Verbascum xanthophoeniceum var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy fruits, which give it the specific epithet *eriocarpum*, meaning "hairy fruit.".</p>
