                    <h1>Vicia leganyana</h1>
<p>Vicia leganyana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Vicia leganyana is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
