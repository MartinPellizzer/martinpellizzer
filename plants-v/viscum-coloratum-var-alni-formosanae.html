                    <h1>Viscum coloratum var. alni-formosanae</h1>
<p>Viscum coloratum var. alni-formosanae, commonly known as the Formosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily willows and poplars.</p>
<p>It possesses a flattened, disc-like stem with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are toxic to mammals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It is native to East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and is often found in humid, forested environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for wildlife while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
