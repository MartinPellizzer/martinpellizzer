                    <h1>Viscum littorum</h1>
<p>Viscum littorum, commonly known as the sea buckthorn, is a parasitic shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees such as oak and pine using haustoria, which extract nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Viscum littorum thrives in salty, windy environments, making it a resilient species adapted to coastal habitats.</p>
