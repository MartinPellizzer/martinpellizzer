<p>Vicia eriocalyx, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Vicia eriocalyx is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and environmental benefits.</p>
