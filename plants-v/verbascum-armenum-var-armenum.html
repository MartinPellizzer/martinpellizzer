                    <h1>Verbascum armenum var. armenum</h1>
<p>Verbascum armenum var. armenum, commonly known as Armenian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
