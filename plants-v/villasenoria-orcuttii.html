<p>Villasenoria orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's cliff-pear, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
