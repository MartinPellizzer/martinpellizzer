<p>Vaccinium subdissitifolium, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Its berries are dark blue to black when mature and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blueberry species.</p>
<p>Vaccinium subdissitifolium thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
