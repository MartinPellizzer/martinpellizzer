                            <h1>Vicia Sativa Var. Leucosperma</h1>
<p>Vicia sativa var. leucosperma is a lesser-known but fascinating legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. This variant of the common vetch is distinguished by its striking white flowers and slender, trailing stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation. Its unique characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>
