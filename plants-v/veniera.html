                    <h1>Veniera</h1>
<p>Veniera, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and a single, striking white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetlands and pine rocklands. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Veniera is considered an endangered species.</p>
