                    <h1>Viscum roxburghianum</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Viscum roxburghianianum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to forest ecosystems.</p>
