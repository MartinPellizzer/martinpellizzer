                    <h1>Virola flexuosa</h1>
<p>Virola flexuosa, commonly known as the "sacha inchi" or "upas tree," is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain edible seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Virola flexuosa is also noted for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its historical use by indigenous communities.</p>
