                    <h1>Viscum subserratum</h1>
<p>Viscum subserratum, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is usually dark green and has a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Viscum subserratum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations, as its berries are a food source for certain species.</p>
