                    <h1>Viscum articulatum var. liquidambaricola</h1>
<p>Viscum articulatum var. liquidambaricola, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellowish-white berries that are toxic to many animals. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced foliage and a reliance on host plants for survival.</p>
