                            <h1>Viola Nemorosa</h1>
<p>Yellow violet, scientifically known as Viola nemorosa, is a delicate yet resilient flowering plant that thrives in woodland and shaded gardens. With its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow petals, it adds a splash of color to early spring landscapes. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is admired for its beauty and ability to bloom even in cool conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological habitats. Despite its modest size, the yellow violet holds a special place in botanical history and horticultural appreciation.</p>
