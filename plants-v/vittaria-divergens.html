                    <h1>Vittaria divergens</h1>
<p>Vittaria divergens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry rhizomes that allow it to grow on trees and other surfaces. The leaves are pinnately divided, with small, ovate fronds that form a dense, mat-like growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ability to colonize various substrates make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
