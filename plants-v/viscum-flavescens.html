                    <h1>Viscum flavescens</h1>
<p>Viscum flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Viscum flavescens is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the host tree's health.</p>
