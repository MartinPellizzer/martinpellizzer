                    <h1>Vaccinium pensylvanicum f. leucocarpum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium pensylvanicum f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited blueberry, is a botanical variant of the highbush blueberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white or pale blue berries, which contrast with the typical blue color of the species. This form is native to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with acidic, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in commercial cultivation due to its smaller fruit size.</p>
