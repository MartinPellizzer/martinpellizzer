                    <h1>Viscum acaciae</h1>
<p>Viscum acaciae, commonly known as the acacia mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of acacia trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can significantly affect the health of its host tree. Its berries are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds.</p>
<p>Viscum acaciae is widely distributed across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
