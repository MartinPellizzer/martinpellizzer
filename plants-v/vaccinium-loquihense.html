<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and cranberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple or black in color, though their flavor is less well-documented due to its limited distribution.</p>
