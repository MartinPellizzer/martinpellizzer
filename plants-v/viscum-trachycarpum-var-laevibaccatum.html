                    <h1>Viscum trachycarpum var. laevibaccatum</h1>
<p>Viscum trachycarpum var. laevibaccatum, commonly known as the smooth-berry mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and poplars.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture, while its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters. The berries are smooth and typically turn red or yellow when mature, facilitating bird dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, though it can also weaken its host.</p>
