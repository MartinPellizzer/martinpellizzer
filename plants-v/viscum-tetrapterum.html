                    <h1>Viscum tetrapterum</h1>
<p>Viscum tetrapterum, commonly known as the four-winged mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum tetrapterum is notable for its unique four-winged structure on its seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its presence can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees, often leading to reduced growth and vitality.</p>
