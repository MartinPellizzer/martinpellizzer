                    <h1>Verbesina heterophylla</h1>
<p>Verbesina heterophylla, commonly known as the variable beggar-ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, hairy seeds enclosed in a bristly capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important species in ecological studies of plant resilience.</p>
