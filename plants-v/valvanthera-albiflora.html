                    <h1>Valvanthera albiflora</h1>
<p>Valvanthera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered valvanthera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, and its most distinguishing characteristic is its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Valvanthera albiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
