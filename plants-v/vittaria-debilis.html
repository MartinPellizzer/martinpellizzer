<p>Vittaria debilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense mats of delicate, light green fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae.</p>
<p>Vittaria debilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
