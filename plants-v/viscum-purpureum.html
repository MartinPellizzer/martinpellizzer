                    <h1>Viscum purpureum</h1>
<p>Viscum purpureum, commonly known as the purple mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and hawthorns, deriving nutrients from its host through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Viscum purpureum is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
