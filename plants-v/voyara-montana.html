                    <h1>Voyara montana</h1>
<p>Voyara montana, commonly known as the mountain voyara, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a thick layer of trichomes.</p>
<p>Voyara montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
