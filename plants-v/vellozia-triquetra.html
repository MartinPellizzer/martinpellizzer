                    <h1>Vellozia triquetra</h1>
<p>Vellozia triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled vellozia, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its unique, triquetrous (three-angled) stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vellozia triquetra is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
