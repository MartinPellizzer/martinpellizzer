                    <h1>Vaccinium fragile</h1>
<p>Vaccinium fragile, commonly known as the slender blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, though they are smaller and less flavorful compared to other blueberry species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
