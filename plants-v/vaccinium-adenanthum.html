                    <h1>Vaccinium adenanthum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium adenanthum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and frequent wind exposure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which give way to dark blue berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local culinary traditions.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit also makes it an effective dune stabilizer, contributing to coastal ecosystem health.</p>
