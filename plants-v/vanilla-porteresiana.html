                    <h1>Vanilla porteresiana</h1>
<p>Vanilla porteresiana, commonly known as the orchid vanilla, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. This plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for commercial vanilla production, unlike its more famous relative, Vanilla planifolia.</p>
