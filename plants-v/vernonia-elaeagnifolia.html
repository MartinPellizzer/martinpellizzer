<p>Vernonia elaeagnifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss and aiding in drought tolerance.</p>
