                    <h1>Viscum ceibarum</h1>
<p>Viscum ceibarum, commonly known as the ceiba mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the ceiba tree, primarily in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that attract birds. The plant derives its nutrients from its host tree through specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Viscum ceibarum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species, which in turn help disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes cause stress or damage to the host tree, depending on the infestation level.</p>
