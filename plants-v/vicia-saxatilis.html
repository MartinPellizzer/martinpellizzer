                    <h1>Vicia saxatilis</h1>
<p>Vicia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Vicia saxatilis is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
