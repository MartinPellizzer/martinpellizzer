<p>Vochysia majuscula, commonly known as the giant velvetleaf, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
