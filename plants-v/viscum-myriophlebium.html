                    <h1>Viscum myriophlebium</h1>
<p>Viscum myriophlebium, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a spongy, white, absorptive tissue. The plant produces small, green, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that are toxic to many animals. It is native to South America and is often found in humid, temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for certain birds and contributing to the decomposition of host trees.</p>
