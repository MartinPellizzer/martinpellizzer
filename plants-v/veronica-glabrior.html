                    <h1>Veronica glabrior</h1>
<p>Veronica glabrior, commonly known as the smooth speedwell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early summer, which are arranged in whorls along the stems. Veronica glabrior thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period.</p>
