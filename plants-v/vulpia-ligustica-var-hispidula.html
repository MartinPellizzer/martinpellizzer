                    <h1>Vulpia ligustica var. hispidula</h1>
<p>Vulpia ligustica var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, greenish-brown florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
