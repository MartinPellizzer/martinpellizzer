<p>Vittaria caudiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to surfaces. Vittaria caudiformis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or decaying wood.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
