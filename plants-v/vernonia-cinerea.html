<p>Vernonia cinerea, commonly known as silky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Vernonia cinerea is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
