<p>Verbascum niveum subsp.</p>
<p>pannosiforme, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the soft, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
