<p>Vigna umbellata, commonly known as the cluster bean or cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and produces clusters of small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has compound leaves with three to seven leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein.</p>
<p>Vigna umbellata also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
