<p>Verbena pulchra var. paludicola, commonly known as the marsh verbena, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of wetlands.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
