<p>Volutarella crupinoides, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to bright green thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, white powdery material. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. It lacks true leaves but has a photosynthetic structure composed of algae and fungi in a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and is often used in ecological studies.</p>
