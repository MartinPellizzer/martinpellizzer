                    <h1>Vicia villosa var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Vicia villosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is valued in ecological restoration projects for its erosion control capabilities and habitat provision for pollinators.</p>
