                    <h1>Vaccinium singularis</h1>
<p>Vaccinium singularis, commonly known as the rare alpine blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark blue berries that are highly prized for their intense flavor and nutritional value. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vaccinium singularis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
