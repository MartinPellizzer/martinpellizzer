<p>Veronica schistosa, commonly known as the stonecrop veronica, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Veronica schistosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
