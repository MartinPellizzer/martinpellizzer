                    <h1>Vulpia mandaliscae</h1>
<p>Vulpia mandaliscae, commonly known as the narrowleaf vulpia, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it is well adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Vulpia mandaliscae is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments.</p>
