                    <h1>Viscum austriacum var. abietis</h1>
<p>Viscum austriacum var. abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of coniferous trees such as pines and firs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which forms a tight hold on the host tree. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in temperate and subalpine forests.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
