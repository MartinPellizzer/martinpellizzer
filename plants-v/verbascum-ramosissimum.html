<p>Verbascum ramosissimum, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Verbascum ramosissimum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
