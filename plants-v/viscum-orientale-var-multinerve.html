                    <h1>Viscum orientale var. multinerve</h1>
<p>Viscum orientale var. multinerve, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are thick and waxy. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive network of veins, contributing to its scientific name "multinerve.".</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
