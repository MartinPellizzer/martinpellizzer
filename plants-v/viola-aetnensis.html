                    <h1>Viola aetnensis</h1>
<p>Viola aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna violet, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>This flowering plant belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its high-altitude habitat. The plant's short growth cycle and specific ecological requirements make it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat degradation and limited distribution.</p>
