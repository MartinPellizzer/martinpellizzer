                    <h1>Vesicaria frigida</h1>
<p>Vesicaria frigida, commonly known as the cold bladder plant, is a rare alpine species native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, translucent, bladder-like structures that form on its stems, which are believed to aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Vesicaria frigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
