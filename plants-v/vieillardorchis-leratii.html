                    <h1>Vieillardorchis leratii</h1>
<p>Vieillardorchis leratii, commonly known as the Lerat's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its flowering period is short, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vieillardorchis leratii is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range.</p>
