<p>Vicia tenera, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several seeds. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
