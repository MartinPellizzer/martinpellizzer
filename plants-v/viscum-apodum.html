                    <h1>Viscum apodum</h1>
<p>Viscum apodum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are covered in a sticky substance called viscin. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum apodum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems and has cultural significance in various traditions.</p>
