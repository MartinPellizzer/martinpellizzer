<p>Viposia integerrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, brown fruits that contain a single seed. Viposia integerrima is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
