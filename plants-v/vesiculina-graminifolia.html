<p>Vesiculina graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, aiding in nutrient absorption. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are often thin and ribbon-like, adapted for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Vesiculina graminifolia plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
