<p>Veronica maritima var. azurea, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and cliffs.</p>
