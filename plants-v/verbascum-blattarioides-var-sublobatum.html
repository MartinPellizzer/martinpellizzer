                    <h1>Verbascum blattarioides var. sublobatum</h1>
<p>Verbascum blattarioides var. sublobatum, commonly known as the broadleaf mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Scrophulariaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
