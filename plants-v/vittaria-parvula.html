<p>Vittaria parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under tree canopies or in rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Vittaria parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
