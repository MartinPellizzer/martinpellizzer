                    <h1>Verbascum grisebachianum</h1>
<p>Verbascum grisebachianum, commonly known as the gray mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the soft, fuzzy texture of its leaves, which resemble the down of a mullein plant.</p>
