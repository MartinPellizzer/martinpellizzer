<p>Vaccinium hasseltii var. sabuletrum, commonly known as the sandplain blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal sandplain regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but tart. Its leaves are oval and leathery, with a dense, compact growth habit that helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing food for wildlife.</p>
