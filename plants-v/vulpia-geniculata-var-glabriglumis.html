                    <h1>Vulpia geniculata var. glabriglumis</h1>
<p>Vulpia geniculata var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the glabrous bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along the edges of wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
