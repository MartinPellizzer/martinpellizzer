                    <h1>Viscum ensifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum ensifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and hawthorns.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often growing in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject in ecological studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
