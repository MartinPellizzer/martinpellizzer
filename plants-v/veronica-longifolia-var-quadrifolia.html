                    <h1>Veronica longifolia var. quadrifolia</h1>
<p>Veronica longifolia var. quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed speedwell, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its four-leafed foliage, which is a rare trait among Veronica species.</p>
