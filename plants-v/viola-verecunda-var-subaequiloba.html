<p>Viola verecunda var. subaequiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers. The plant prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
