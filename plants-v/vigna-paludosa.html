                    <h1>Vigna paludosa</h1>
<p>Vigna paludosa, commonly known as swamp cowpea, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing several angular, edible seeds. Vigna paludosa is adapted to moist, poorly drained soils and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
