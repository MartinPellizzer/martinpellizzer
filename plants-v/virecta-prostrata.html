<p>Virecta prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate virecta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with slender,匍匐的 stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>Virecta prostrata is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade conditions.</p>
