<p>Viscum ratenbergii, commonly known as the Ratenberg mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum ratenbergii is found in various regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in specific ecological niches.</p>
