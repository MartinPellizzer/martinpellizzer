<p>Viscum whitei subsp.</p>
<p>whitei, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in temperate regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses.</p>
<p>The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, sticky berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It is often found in forested areas where its host species thrive.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted for a parasitic lifestyle, with specialized structures for attaching to and extracting resources from its host.</p>
