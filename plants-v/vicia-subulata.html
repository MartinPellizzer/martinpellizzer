                    <h1>Vicia subulata</h1>
<p>Vicia subulata, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia subulata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system.</p>
