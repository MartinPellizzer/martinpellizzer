                    <h1>Viscum polycoccon</h1>
<p>Viscum polycoccon, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white, waxy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its sticky seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum polycoccon plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
