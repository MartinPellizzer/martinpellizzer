<p>Vernonia beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Vernonia beddomei plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native pollinators.</p>
