                    <h1>Vernonia saltensis</h1>
<p>Vernonia saltensis, commonly known as saltbush vernonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Vernonia saltensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
