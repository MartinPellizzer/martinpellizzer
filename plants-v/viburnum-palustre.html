                    <h1>Viburnum palustre</h1>
<p>Viburnum palustre, commonly known as swamp viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to wetlands and moist forests in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a hardy species in swampy environments.</p>
<p>Viburnum palustre is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
