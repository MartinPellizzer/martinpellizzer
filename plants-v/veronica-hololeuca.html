                    <h1>Veronica hololeuca</h1>
<p>Veronica hololeuca, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Veronica hololeuca is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
