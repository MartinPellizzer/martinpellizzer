                    <h1>Verbascum oreophilum var. joannis</h1>
<p>Verbascum oreophilum var. joannis, commonly known as the alpine mullein, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a thick layer of soft, downy pubescence. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, candle-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
