<p>Viola grypoceras f. hemileuca, commonly known as the pale violet, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive pale lavender to almost white flowers.</p>

It is often found in woodland areas and shaded gardens, where it can flourish without direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is considered a fascinating example of varietal variation within the Viola genus.</p>
