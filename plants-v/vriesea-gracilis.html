<p>Vriesea gracilis, commonly known as the slender vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea gracilis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
