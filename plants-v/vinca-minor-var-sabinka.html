                    <h1>Vinca minor var. sabinka</h1>
<p>Vinca minor var. sabinka, commonly known as the creeping Jenny or small leaf vinca, is a low-growing perennial ground cover plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It has a spreading habit, making it ideal for filling in gaps in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use.</p>
