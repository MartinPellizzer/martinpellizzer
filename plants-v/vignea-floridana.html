<p>Vignea floridana, commonly known as the Florida vigna, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies.
