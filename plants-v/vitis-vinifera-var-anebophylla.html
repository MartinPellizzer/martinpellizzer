                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. anebophylla</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. anebophylla, commonly known as the Anebophylla grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the European grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a distinct, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and requires a specific set of environmental conditions to thrive. Its berries are smaller than those of standard Vitis vinifera varieties and are often used in specialized winemaking or as ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
