<p>Viburnum prunifolium var. bushii is a unique variant of the common arrowwood viburnum known for its distinctive foliage and floral display. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas across the eastern United States. Its leaves turn a striking red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are clustered and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is prized by gardeners for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
