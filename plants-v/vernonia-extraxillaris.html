<p>Vernonia extraxillaris, commonly known as the silverleaf vernonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, providing additional insulation against heat.</p>
<p>Vernonia extraxillaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
