<p>Vandopsis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese vandopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Vandopsis chinensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
