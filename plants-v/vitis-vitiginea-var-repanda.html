                    <h1>Vitis vitiginea var. repanda</h1>
<p>Vitis vitiginea var. repanda, commonly known as the creeping grape or sand grape, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pale green leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
