<p>Vauquelinia californica subsp.</p>
<p>retherfordii, commonly known as the California broom, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing shrub with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species.</p>
