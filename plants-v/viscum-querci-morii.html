                    <h1>Viscum querci-morii</h1>
<p>Viscum querci-morii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of deciduous trees, particularly oaks.</p>
<p>It has a smooth, glossy evergreen foliage and produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals but are an important food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Viscum querci-morii plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
