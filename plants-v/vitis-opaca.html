                    <h1>Vitis opaca</h1>
<p>Vitis opaca, commonly known as the sand grape, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to clusters of grape-like berries. These berries are typically dark blue to black in color and are edible, though not as widely cultivated as other grape species.</p>
<p>Vitis opaca is often found in sandy or rocky soils along stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
