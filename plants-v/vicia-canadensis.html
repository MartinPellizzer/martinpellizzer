<p>Vicia canadensis, commonly known as Canadian vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging in color from purple to violet. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Canadian vetch is often found in disturbed soils and is used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
