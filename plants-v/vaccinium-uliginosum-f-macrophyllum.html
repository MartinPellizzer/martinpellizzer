                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum f. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved bog bilberry, is a variant of the common bilberry found in wet, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which are often a deep green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, red berries similar to those of the parent species, which are edible and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils across northern regions.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>
