<p>Vicia araucana, commonly known as the Araucanian vetch, is a perennial legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, pea-like pods that contain small, dark brown seeds. Vicia araucana is adapted to grow in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
