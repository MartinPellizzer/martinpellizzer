<p>Vesicaria montana, commonly known as the mountain bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually submerged or partially submerged, with specialized structures for capturing insects.</p>
<p>Vesicaria montana plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
