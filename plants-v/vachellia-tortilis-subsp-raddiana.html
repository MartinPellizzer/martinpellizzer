<p>Vachellia tortilis subsp.</p>
<p>raddiana, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its many branches.</p>
<p>The plant has small, compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, and it produces long, flat pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
