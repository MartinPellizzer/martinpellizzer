                    <h1>Vigna vexillata</h1>
<p>Vigna vexillata, commonly known as the African bean or cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several kidney-shaped seeds. Vigna vexillata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it an important crop in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules enhances soil fertility.</p>
