                    <h1>Valeriana incisa</h1>
<p>Valeriana incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf valerian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that become more deeply lobed as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in late summer. Valeriana incisa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional medicine for their calming properties.</p>
