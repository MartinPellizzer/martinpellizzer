<p>Vriesea anceps, commonly known as the flame-up plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect water in its central cup. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, spathaceous bracts that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or green accents. Vriesea anceps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
