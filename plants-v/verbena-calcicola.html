                    <h1>Verbena calcicola</h1>
<p>Verbena calcicola, commonly known as the limestone verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Verbena calcicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
