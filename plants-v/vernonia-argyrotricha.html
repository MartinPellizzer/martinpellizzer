                    <h1>Vernonia argyrotricha</h1>
<p>Vernonia argyrotricha, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering its leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its showy purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Vernonia argyrotricha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
