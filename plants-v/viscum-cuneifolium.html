                <h1>Viscum cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can impact the growth and health of its host trees, making it an ecologically significant species.</p>
