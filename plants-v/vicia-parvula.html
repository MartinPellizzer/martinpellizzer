                    <h1>Vicia parvula</h1>
<p>Vicia parvula, commonly known as the small vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Vicia parvula is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
