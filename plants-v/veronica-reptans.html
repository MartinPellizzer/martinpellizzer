                <h1>Veronica reptans</h1>
<p>Veronica reptans, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, with a dark green color that contrasts with the delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Veronica reptans is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
