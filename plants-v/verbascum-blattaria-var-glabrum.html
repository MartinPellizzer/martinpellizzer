<p>Verbascum blattaria var. glabrum, commonly known as the silky hairplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and tall, slender stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its common name reflects the silky texture of its foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is a variant of the broader Verbascum blattaria species, distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the leaves.</p>
