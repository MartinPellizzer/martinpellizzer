                    <h1>Vicia bidentata</h1>
<p>Vicia bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with two small, toothed lobes on each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-shaped pods containing several seeds. Vicia bidentata is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>It is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators.</p>
