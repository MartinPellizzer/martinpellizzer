                    <h1>Verbena glandulosa</h1>
<p>Verbena glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture and help in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its short blooming period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
