                    <h1>Viscum oliganthum</h1>
<p>Viscum oliganthum, commonly known as the dwarf European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Viscum oliganthum has a complex life cycle involving both a dormant seed stage and a germinating phase that requires the presence of a suitable host.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
