                    <h1>Viburnum opulus var. subintegrifolium</h1>
<p>Viburnum opulus var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a serrated edge that is less pronounced than in the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, persistent berries that provide food for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and seasonal changes in color.</p>
