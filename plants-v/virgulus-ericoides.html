                    <h1>Virgulus ericoides</h1>
<p>Virgulus ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
