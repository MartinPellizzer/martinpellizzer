<p>Viola sacchalinensis f. albialpina, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage and flowers are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
