<p>Vernonia rampans, commonly known as the spreading ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces fibrous, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Vernonia rampans is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
