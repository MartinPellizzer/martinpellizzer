                    <h1>Vulpia myuros</h1>
<p>Vulpia myuros, commonly known as the sticky foxgrass, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its seeds are covered in a sticky substance, which aids in their attachment to animals or objects for dispersal.</p>
<p>Vulpia myuros is considered a weed in some agricultural settings but plays a role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
