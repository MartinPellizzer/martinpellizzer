                    <h1>Vicia geminiflora</h1>
<p>Vicia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in pairs, giving it its common name. Vicia geminiflora is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
