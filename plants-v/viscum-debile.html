                    <h1>Viscum debile</h1>
<p>Viscum debile, commonly known as the weak mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Betulaceae and Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Viscum debile is typically found in temperate regions and is often associated with old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
