                    <h1>Viola sylvestris subvar. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Viola sylvestris subvar. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Viola sylvestris, and it produces violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
