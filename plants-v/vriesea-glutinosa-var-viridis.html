                    <h1>Vriesea glutinosa var. viridis</h1>
<p>Vriesea glutinosa var. viridis, commonly known as the green vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy, sticky substance, giving it its scientific name "glutinosa.". The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
