                    <h1>Vitis serotina</h1>
<p>Vitis serotina, commonly known as wild grape or late blackberry, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows along stream banks and in woodland areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its berries are edible but are often bitter and less palatable than those of cultivated grapes.</p>
<p>Vitis serotina plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
