<p>Viscum flavens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is native to regions of southern Africa, including South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>Viscum flavens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help in seed dispersal.</p>
