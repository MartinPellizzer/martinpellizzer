                    <h1>Vandopsis curvata</h1>
<p>Vandopsis curvata, commonly known as the curved vandopsis, is a rare epiphytic fern belonging to the family VANDACEAE.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically curved or arched in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vandopsis curvata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
