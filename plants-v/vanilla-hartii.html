                    <h1>Vanilla hartii</h1>
<p>Vanilla hartii, commonly known as the giant vanilla or the Mexican vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. Its vanilla pods, which develop after pollination, are smaller and less aromatic compared to those of Vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in culinary and aromatic applications.</p>
