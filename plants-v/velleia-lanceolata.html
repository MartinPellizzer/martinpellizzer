<p>Velleia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf velleia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and early summer. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Velleia lanceolata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
