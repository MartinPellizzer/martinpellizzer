                    <h1>Vitis vitiginea var. campestris</h1>
<p>Vitis vitiginea var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grapevine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears small, sour-tasting berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas.</p>
