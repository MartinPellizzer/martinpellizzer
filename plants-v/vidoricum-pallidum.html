                    <h1>Vidoricum pallidum</h1>
<p>Vidoricum pallidum, commonly known as the pale vidore, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vidoricum pallidum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
