                    <h1>Van-tieghemia densifolia</h1>
<p>Van-tieghemia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree and is considered a common parasite in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
