                    <h1>Vriesea maguirei</h1>
<p>Vriesea maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with colorful, long-lasting bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea maguirei is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in indoor settings.</p>
