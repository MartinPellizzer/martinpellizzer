                    <h1>Vanilla uncinata</h1>
<p>Vanilla uncinata, commonly known as the climbing vanilla orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by long, thin pods. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a support structure to climb. Its pods, which mature to a dark brown color, are harvested for their aromatic seeds used in culinary and perfumery applications.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Vanilla uncinata make it distinct from the more widely cultivated Vanilla planifolia.</p>
