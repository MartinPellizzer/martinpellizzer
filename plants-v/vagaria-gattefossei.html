<p>Vagaria gattefossei, commonly known as the glasswing fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
