                    <h1>Vachellia tortilis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Vachellia tortilis var. pubescens, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
