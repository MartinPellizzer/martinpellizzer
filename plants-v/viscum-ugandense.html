                    <h1>Viscum ugandense</h1>
<p>Viscum ugandense, commonly known as the Ugandan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of East Africa. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem, which is covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum ugandense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals, which in turn aid in seed dispersal.</p>
