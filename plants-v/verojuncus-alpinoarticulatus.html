<p>Verojuncus alpinoarticulatus, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which are typical of clubmosses. It produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
