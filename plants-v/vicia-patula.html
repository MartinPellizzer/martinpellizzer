<p>Vicia patula, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
