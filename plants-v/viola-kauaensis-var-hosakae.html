<p>Viola kauaensis var. hosakae, commonly known as the Kauaʻi violet, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kauaʻi in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, showy violet flowers with distinctive markings. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
