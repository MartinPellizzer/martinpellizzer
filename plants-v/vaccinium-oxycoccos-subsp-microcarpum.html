<p>Vaccinium oxycoccos subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpum, commonly known as the lesser cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on acidic, wet soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cranberry species. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and remain green throughout the year.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruits and shorter pedicels compared to the typical *V. oxycoccos*.</p>
