                    <h1>Viscum trinervium</h1>
<p>Viscum trinervium, commonly known as the small-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and aid in dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum trinervium plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
