<p>Vatica mangachapoi var. wanningensis, commonly known as the Wanning ironwood, is a rare and woody species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, often buttressed roots that anchor it firmly in its habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforests, where it plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
