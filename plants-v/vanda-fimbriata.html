                    <h1>Vanda fimbriata</h1>
<p>Vanda fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive fringed appearance on the petals. Vanda fimbriata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
