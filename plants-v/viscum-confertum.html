<p>Viscum confertum, commonly known as the dense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often eaten by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Viscum confertum is native to various regions in Europe and is often found in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a spongy root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from its host.</p>
