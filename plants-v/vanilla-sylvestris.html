                    <h1>Vanilla sylvestris</h1>
<p>Vanilla sylvestris, commonly known as wild vanilla, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its natural habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its long, thin, greenish-black pods, which contain the vanilla beans used in flavoring. These pods take several months to mature and develop their characteristic aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its specific pollination requirements, Vanilla sylvestris is rarely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
