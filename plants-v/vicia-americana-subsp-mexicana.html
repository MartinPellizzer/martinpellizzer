<p>Vicia americana subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems that often bear small, yellow pea-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
