                    <h1>Viscum heteranthum</h1>
<p>Viscum heteranthum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for attachment and absorption. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum heteranthum plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife species.</p>
