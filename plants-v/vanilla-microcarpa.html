                    <h1>Vanilla microcarpa</h1>
<p>Vanilla microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf vanilla orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and climbing habit.

It thrives in warm, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
