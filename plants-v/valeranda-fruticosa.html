<p>Valeranda fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
