<p>Vachellia hebeclada subsp.</p>
<p>chobiensis, commonly known as the Chobiensis thorn tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its straight, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in local landscaping and for its potential ecological benefits.</p>
