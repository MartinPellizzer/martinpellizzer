<p>Vernonia gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other forms of Vernonia gracilis.</p>
