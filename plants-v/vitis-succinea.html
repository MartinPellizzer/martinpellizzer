<p>Vitis succinea, commonly known as the swamp grape or water grape, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Vitis succinea thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
