<p>Veratrum album proles lobelianum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are followed by egg-shaped berries that turn dark blue as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
