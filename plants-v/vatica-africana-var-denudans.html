<p>Vatica africana var. denudans, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by hard, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
