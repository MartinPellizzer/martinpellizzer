<p>Vicia sativa subsp.</p>
<p>amphicarpa, commonly known as the two-seeded vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces two distinct types of pods, one containing one seed and the other containing two, which is a key feature distinguishing it from other vetch species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in traditional agriculture and forage.</p>
