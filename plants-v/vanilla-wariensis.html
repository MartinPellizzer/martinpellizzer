                    <h1>Vanilla wariensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla wariensis, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing tropical vine native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, thin stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees found only in its native habitat. After pollination, the flower develops into a pod-like fruit called a vanilla bean, which is the source of the highly valued vanilla flavoring.</p>
<p>The plant requires warm, humid conditions and is often grown in shaded environments.</p>
