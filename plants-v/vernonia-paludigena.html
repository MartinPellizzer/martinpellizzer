The plant features upright stems covered in dense, hairy foliage and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Vernonia paludigena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
