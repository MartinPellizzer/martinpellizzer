                    <h1>Vicia bracteata</h1>
<p>Vicia bracteata, commonly known as the bracted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are trifoliate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on elongated peduncles. Its pods are slender, cylindrical, and contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Vicia bracteata is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.</p>
