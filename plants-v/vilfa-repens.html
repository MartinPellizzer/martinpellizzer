                    <h1>Vilfa repens</h1>
<p>Vilfa repens, commonly known as creeping violets, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and clusters of delicate, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Vilfa repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
