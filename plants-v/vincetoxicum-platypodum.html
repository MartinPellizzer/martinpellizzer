<p>Vincetoxicum platypodum, commonly known as the purple leaf celandine, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish-purple in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits.</p>
