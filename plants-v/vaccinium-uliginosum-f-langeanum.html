                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum f. langeanum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum f. langeanum, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to wet, acidic soils in northern regions.</p>
<p>It produces small, dark blue berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common blueberry. The plant has elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It thrives in boggy or swampy environments and is often found in heathlands and peat bogs.</p>
<p>This form is considered a natural variant of the broader Vaccinium uliginosum species.</p>
