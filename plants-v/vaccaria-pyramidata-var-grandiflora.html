                    <h1>Vaccaria pyramidata var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Vaccaria pyramidata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with pale green, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
