<p>Voatamalo capuronii, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are capable of photosynthesis, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Voatamalo capuronii is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering to prevent root rot.</p>
