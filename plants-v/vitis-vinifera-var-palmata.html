                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. palmata</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate grape, is a less commonly cultivated variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other Vitis species. The plant typically grows as a vine with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across supports. While it is not widely used for wine production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
<p>Its berries are generally smaller and less sweet compared to those of other Vitis varieties.</p>
