<p>Viola fletcheri, commonly known as the Fletcher's violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hair, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Viola fletcheri is considered an endangered species.</p>
