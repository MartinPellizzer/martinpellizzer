                    <h1>Viscum vaginatum</h1>
<p>Viscum vaginatum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Viscum vaginatum plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
