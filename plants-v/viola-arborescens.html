                    <h1>Viola arborescens</h1>
<p>Viola arborescens, commonly known as the tree violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture, and clusters of violet or purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats.</p>
