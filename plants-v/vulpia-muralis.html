                    <h1>Vulpia muralis</h1>
<p>Vulpia muralis, commonly known as wall grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in disturbed soils, often found along walls, roadsides, and in rocky or urban environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and dry climates.</p>
<p>Vulpia muralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats.</p>
