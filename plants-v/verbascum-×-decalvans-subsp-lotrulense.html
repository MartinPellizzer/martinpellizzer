<p>Verbascum × decalvans subsp.</p>
<p>lotrulense, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often grayish-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, elongated inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
