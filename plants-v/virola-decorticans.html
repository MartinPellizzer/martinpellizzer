<p>Virola decorticans, commonly known as the copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces a resinous sap that hardens into copal, a substance used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
