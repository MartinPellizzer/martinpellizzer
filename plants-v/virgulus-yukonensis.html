<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and wetland habitats. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Virgulus yukonensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its cold, harsh environment.</p>
