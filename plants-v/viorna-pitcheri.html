<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has a short lifespan, often blooming only once before dying, which makes it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. Its conservation status is critical due to threats from development and climate change.</p>
<p>Viorna pitcheri plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
