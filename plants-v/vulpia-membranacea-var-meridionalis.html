                    <h1>Vulpia membranacea var. meridionalis</h1>
<p>Vulpia membranacea var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern hairy veldtgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
