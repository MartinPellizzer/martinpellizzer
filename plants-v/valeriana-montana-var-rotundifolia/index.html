                            <h1>Valeriana Montana Var. Rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Mountain valerian, scientifically known as Valeriana montana var. rotundifolia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. This herbaceous perennial thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations where few other plants can survive. Its small, clustered white flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to the rugged mountain landscapes. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its historical use in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
