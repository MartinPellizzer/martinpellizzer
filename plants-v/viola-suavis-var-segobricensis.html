<p>Viola suavis var. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric wild violet, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the sweet violet.</p>

The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species.</p>
