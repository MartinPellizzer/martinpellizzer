                    <h1>Vanilla hostmannii</h1>
<p>Vanilla hostmannii, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the orchid vanilla, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark brown pods. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a support structure to grow. Its vanilla-like aroma comes from the chemical compounds present in its pods.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not used commercially for vanilla extraction, unlike Vanilla planifolia.</p>
