                    <h1>Verdesmum menglaense</h1>
<p>Verdesmum menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla greenwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-lying mats. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Verdesmum menglaense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
