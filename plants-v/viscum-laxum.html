                    <h1>Viscum laxum</h1>
<p>Viscum laxum, commonly known as the lax mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and hawthorns.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Viscum laxum has a dense, leafy structure with small, leathery leaves and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both asexual propagation through stem cuttings and sexual reproduction via its seeds.</p>
