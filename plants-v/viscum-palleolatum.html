<p>Viscum palleolatum, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a parasitic evergreen shrub belonging to the family Viscaceae.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are oval-shaped and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature.</p>
<p>Viscum palleolatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
