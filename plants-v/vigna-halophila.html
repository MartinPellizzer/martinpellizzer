                    <h1>Vigna halophila</h1>
<p>Vigna halophila, commonly known as saltbush or saltbush bean, is a halophytic legume native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and arid environments, making it an important plant for ecological restoration in coastal ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Vigna halophila is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture in salt-affected soils.</p>
