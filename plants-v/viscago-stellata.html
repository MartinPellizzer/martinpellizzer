<p>Viscago stellata, commonly known as starleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and it produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to animals. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesis provides it with additional energy. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
