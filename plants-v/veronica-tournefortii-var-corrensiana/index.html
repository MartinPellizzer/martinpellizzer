                            <h1>Veronica Tournefortii Var. Corrensiana</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Veronica tournefortii var. corrensiana, is a striking member of the plantain family native to the rocky coastal regions of southern California. This hardy perennial is characterized by its vibrant blue flowers and silver-green foliage, which thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Despite its beauty, Blueweed is often overlooked in favor of more common garden plants. With its adaptability and resilience, it stands as a testament to nature's ability to flourish in challenging environments.</p>
