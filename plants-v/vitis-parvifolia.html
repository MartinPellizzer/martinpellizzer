                    <h1>Vitis parvifolia</h1>
<p>Vitis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Vitis parvifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in ecological systems.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically cultivated for wine production due to the smaller size and lower sugar content of its berries.</p>
