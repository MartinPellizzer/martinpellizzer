                    <h1>Volutaria muricata</h1>
<p>Volutaria muricata, commonly known as the spiny rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Volutaria muricata is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
