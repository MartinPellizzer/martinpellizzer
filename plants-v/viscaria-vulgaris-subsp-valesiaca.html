<p>Viscaria vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>valesiaca, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in sunny alpine meadows. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
