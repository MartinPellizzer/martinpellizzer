<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, which gives it its common name.

Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a red throat, and bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Vriesea tubipetala is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of indirect light and moderate humidity.</p>
