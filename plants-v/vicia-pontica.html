<p>Vicia pontica, commonly known as the Pontic vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the regions of the Black Sea and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems that bear small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Vicia pontica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
