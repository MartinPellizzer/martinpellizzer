                <h1>Vitellaria multiflora</h1>
<p>Vitellaria multiflora, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elongated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing a fatty seed kernel. The seeds are widely used to make shea butter, which is valued for its moisturizing properties in cosmetics and cooking.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological and economic role in many African countries.</p>
