                    <h1>Veronica cupressoides</h1>
<p>Veronica cupressoides, commonly known as the creeping veronica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like appearance with needle-like leaves that give it a resemblance to juniper. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion.</p>
