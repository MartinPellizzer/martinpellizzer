                    <h1>Vernonia caudata</h1>
<p>Vernonia caudata, commonly known as ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 feet, with erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its showy purple to blue flower heads appear in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are often glandular and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
