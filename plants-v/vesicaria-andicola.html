                    <h1>Vesicaria andicola</h1>
<p>Vesicaria andicola, commonly known as the Andean bladder fern, is a fern species native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Vesicaria andicola plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
