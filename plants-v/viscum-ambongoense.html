                    <h1>Viscum ambongoense</h1>
<p>Viscum ambongoense, commonly known as the Ambongo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Viscum ambongoense is also of interest in traditional medicine and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
