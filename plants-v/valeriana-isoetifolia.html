                    <h1>Valeriana isoetifolia</h1>
<p>Valeriana isoetifolia, commonly known as the sea valerian, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in marshes and along shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in soft, wet soils and contributes to its ability to tolerate high salt levels.</p>
<p>Valeriana isoetifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
