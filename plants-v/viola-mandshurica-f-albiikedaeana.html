                    <h1>Viola mandshurica f. albiikedaeana</h1>
<p>Viola mandshurica f. albiikedaeana, commonly known as the white-veined violet, is a rare and striking variant of the viola genus native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white veins that contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive downward-curving spur. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild.</p>
