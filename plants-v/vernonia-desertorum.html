                <h1>Vernonia desertorum</h1>
<p>Vernonia desertorum, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Vernonia desertorum is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions.</p>
