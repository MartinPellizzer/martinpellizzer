                    <h1>Vulpia alopecuros var. silvatica</h1>
<p>Vulpia alopecuros var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest vulpia, is a variant of the common vulpia, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often humid habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
