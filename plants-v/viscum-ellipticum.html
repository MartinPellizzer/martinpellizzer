                    <h1>Viscum ellipticum</h1>
<p>Viscum ellipticum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Viscum ellipticum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its host trees.</p>
