<p>Vincetoxicum raddeanum, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a reddish hue during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds such as cytisine.</p>
<p>Vincetoxicum raddeanum thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
