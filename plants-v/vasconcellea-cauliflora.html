                    <h1>Vasconcellea cauliflora</h1>
<p>Vasconcellea cauliflora, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers develop directly on the stem rather than the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually give way to edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically fragrant, with a sweet and tangy flavor, making it a popular choice for both culinary and ornamental purposes.</p>
