<p>Vicia onusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
<p>Vicia onusta has been used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings.</p>
