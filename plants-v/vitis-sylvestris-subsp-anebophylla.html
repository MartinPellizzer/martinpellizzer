<p>Vitis sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>anebophylla, commonly known as the wild grapevine with broad leaves, is a subspecies native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its woody vines and compound leaves that are broader than those of the typical Vitis sylvestris.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of berries that range in color from red to black. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other grape species.</p>
