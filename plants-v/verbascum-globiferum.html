<p>Verbascum globiferum, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Verbascum globiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
