                    <h1>Vicia latifolia</h1>
<p>Vicia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are broad and often hairy, and its clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically rounded and brown in color. Vicia latifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and growth habits make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
