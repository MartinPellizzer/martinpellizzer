                    <h1>Viola grypoceras f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Viola grypoceras f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered violet, is a botanical variant of the viola genus characterized by its pale or white petals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is typically found in woodland or shaded areas. It possesses heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, typical of many viola species. The flowers are small, usually less than 2 inches in diameter, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other viola varieties.</p>
