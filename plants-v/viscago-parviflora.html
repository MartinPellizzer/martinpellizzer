                    <h1>Viscago parviflora</h1>
<p>Viscago parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its seeds are dispersed through bird droppings, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Viscago parviflora is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
