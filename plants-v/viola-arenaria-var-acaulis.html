<p>Viola arenaria var. acaulis, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base, which is adapted for pollination by bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats, making it a hardy ground cover plant.</p>
