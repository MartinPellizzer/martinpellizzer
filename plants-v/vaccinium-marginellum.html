<p>Vaccinium marginellum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a species of shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink to white in color. These flowers give way to edible, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart flavor.</p>
<p>Vaccinium marginellum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments along the Pacific coast.</p>
