<p>Viscum nyanzense, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as Acacia and Eucalyptus. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are evergreen, and it has a complex relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing shelter for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Viscum nyanzense plays a role in local ecosystems but is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential.</p>
