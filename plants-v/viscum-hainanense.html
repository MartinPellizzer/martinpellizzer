<p>Viscum hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the Chinese tallow tree, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that contain seeds. It has a dense, leafy appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Viscum hainanense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
