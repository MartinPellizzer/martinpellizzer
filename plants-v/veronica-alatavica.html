<p>Veronica alatavica, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Veronica alatavica is well adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
