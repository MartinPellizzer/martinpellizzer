                    <h1>Vandenboschia africana</h1>
<p>Vandenboschia africana, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from light rains.</p>
<p>Vandenboschia africana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
