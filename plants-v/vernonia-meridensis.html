<p>Vernonia meridensis, commonly known as the desert ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Vernonia meridensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It also serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
