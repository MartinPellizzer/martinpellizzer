                    <h1>Viscum stellatum</h1>
<p>Viscum stellatum, commonly known as starleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis with its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces tiny, white, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Viscum stellatum is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the host trees it infests.</p>
