<p>Viola palustris subsp.</p>
<p>pubifolia, commonly known as the swamp violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly wrinkled.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy violet flowers with five petals, often in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other violas but is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) foliage and specific ecological preferences.</p>
