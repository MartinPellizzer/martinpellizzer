<p>Vincetoxicum productum, commonly known as the European adder's mouth, is a climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color.

It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Vincetoxicum productum is noted for its ornamental value but should be handled with care due to its toxic properties.</p>
