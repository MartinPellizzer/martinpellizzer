<p>Vicia jordanovii, commonly known as Jordan's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly found in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Vicia jordanovii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
