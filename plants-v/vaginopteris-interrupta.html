<p>Vaginopteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Vaginopteris interrupta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
