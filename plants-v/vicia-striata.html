<p>Vicia striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive striated appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging from pink to violet in color. Its trifoliate leaves and stipitate stipules are characteristic of the genus Vicia.</p>
<p>Vicia striata is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
