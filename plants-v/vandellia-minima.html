<p>Vandellia minima, commonly known as the dwarf vandellia, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant produces compact, green leaves and has small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
