<p>Vitis labrusca var. alba, commonly known as the White Labrusca grape, is a lesser-known variety of the Vitis labrusca species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white berries, which contrast with the more common purple or black hues of other labrusca varieties. The plant typically grows as a vigorous vine with compound leaves and tendrils, adapting well to various climates. It is often cultivated for its unique flavor profile and potential use in winemaking.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially popular compared to other grape varieties due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
