                    <h1>Vangueria ruwenzoriensis var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Vangueria ruwenzoriensis var. breviflora, commonly known as the Ruwenzori vangueria, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
