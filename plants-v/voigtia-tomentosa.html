                    <h1>Voigtia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Voigtia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly voigtia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for container gardening and adds an ornamental touch to dry landscapes.</p>
