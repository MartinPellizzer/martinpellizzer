                    <h1>Vriesea chrysostachys var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Vriesea chrysostachys var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender inflorescence that produces vibrant orange to red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
