                    <h1>Viscum pycnanthum</h1>
<p>Viscum pycnanthum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a dense, evergreen structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature makes it both a subject of ecological study and a symbol in various cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Viscum pycnanthum plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and supporting a range of wildlife.</p>
