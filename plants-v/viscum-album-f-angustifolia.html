                    <h1>Viscum album f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Viscum album f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Viscum album. The plant produces white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This form of mistletoe is often associated with traditional holiday customs and has cultural significance in various regions.</p>
