                    <h1>Vanda confusa</h1>
<p>Vanda confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a visible root system, relying instead on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white with a yellow throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
