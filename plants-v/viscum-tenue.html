                    <h1>Viscum tenue</h1>
<p>Viscum tenue, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on various species of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system. Viscum tenue is native to regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important subject in the study of plant parasitism.</p>
