                    <h1>Varinga repens</h1>
<p>Varinga repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐的 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Varinga repens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
