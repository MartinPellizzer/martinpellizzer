<p>It features slender, upright stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its alternate leaf arrangement, which differentiates it from the typical varietal form.</p>
