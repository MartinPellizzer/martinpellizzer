<p>Viola subatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic violet, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Viola subatlantica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
