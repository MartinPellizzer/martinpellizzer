                    <h1>Vicia villosa var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Vicia villosa var. latifolia, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and is often cultivated as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Vicia villosa var. latifolia is also used as forage for livestock in some regions.</p>
