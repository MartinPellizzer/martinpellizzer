                    <h1>Viscum platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Viscum platyphyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified to form a spongy, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Viscum platyphyllum is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host trees.</p>
