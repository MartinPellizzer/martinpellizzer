                    <h1>Viscum tuniforme</h1>
<p>Viscum tuniforme, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum tuniforme is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
