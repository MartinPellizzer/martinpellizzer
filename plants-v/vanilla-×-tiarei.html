<p>Vanilla × tiarei, commonly known as the Tahitian vanilla, is a hybrid orchid native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine with dark green, ovate leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is renowned for its vanilla pods, which are harvested after a lengthy maturation period. These pods are used to extract vanilla flavoring, though they are less commonly used than the more commercially popular vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its unique aroma and is cultivated in tropical regions for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
