<p>Vachellia californica, commonly known as the California acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Vachellia californica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
