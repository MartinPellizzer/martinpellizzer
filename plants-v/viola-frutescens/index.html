                            <h1>Viola Frutescens</h1>
<p>Purple violet, scientifically known as Viola frutescens, is a charming member of the Violaceae family that captivates with its vibrant hues and delicate blooms. Native to the eastern United States, this plant thrives in woodland and shaded areas where it spreads its foliage with elegance. Its flowers, which range from deep purple to soft lavender, bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted landscape. The plant's heart-shaped leaves and compact growth make it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats alike. With its historical use in herbal medicine and its ability to attract pollinators, the purple violet remains a symbol of resilience and beauty in the wild.</p>
