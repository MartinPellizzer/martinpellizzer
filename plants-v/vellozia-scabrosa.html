                    <h1>Vellozia scabrosa</h1>
<p>Vellozia scabrosa, commonly known as the rough vellozia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Vellozia scabrosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology makes it a striking addition to succulent collections and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
