                    <h1>Vanilla dubia</h1>
<p>Vanilla dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Vanilla dubia is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
