                    <h1>Vanilla philippinensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its long, fleshy, dark brown pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla beans used in flavoring. These beans develop after the flowers are pollinated and undergo a curing process to enhance their fragrance.</p>
<p>Vanilla philippinensis is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
