<p>Viscum bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Viscum bequaertii plays a role in ecological interactions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
