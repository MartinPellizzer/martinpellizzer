                    <h1>Vulpia myuros var. deserti</h1>
<p>Vulpia myuros var. deserti, commonly known as the desert mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, dense tufts of foliage and slender, hairless leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low-water environments.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
