                    <h1>Viscum coloratum var. lutescens</h1>
<p>Viscum coloratum var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into berries containing sticky seeds. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
