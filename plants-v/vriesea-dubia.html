                    <h1>Vriesea dubia</h1>
<p>Vriesea dubia, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea dubia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
