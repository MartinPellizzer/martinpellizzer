                    <h1>Vieusseuxia edulis</h1>
<p>Vieusseuxia edulis, commonly known as the edible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
