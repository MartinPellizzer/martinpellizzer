<p>Verbena trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly verbena, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, opposite leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 3 feet.</p>
<p>Verbena trichotoma is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
