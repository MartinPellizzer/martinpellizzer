<p>Viscum cupressoides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and relies on its host for nutrients, often causing deformation in the host's growth. Viscum cupressoides is native to regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
