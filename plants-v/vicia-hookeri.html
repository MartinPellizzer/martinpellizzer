<p>Vicia hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
