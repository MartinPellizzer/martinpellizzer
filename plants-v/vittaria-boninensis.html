<p>Vittaria boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin maidenhair fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant has a unique morphology, with slender, wiry rhizomes and small, elliptical pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Vittaria boninensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky or forested substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
