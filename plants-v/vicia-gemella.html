<p>Vicia gemella, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Vicia gemella is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
