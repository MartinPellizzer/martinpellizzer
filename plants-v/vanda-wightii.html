<p>Vanda wightii, commonly known as the Wight's vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often in clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Vanda wightii is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
