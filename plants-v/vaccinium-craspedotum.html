<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark blue or black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
