                    <h1>Vanilla claviculata</h1>
<p>Vanilla claviculata, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers followed by long, thin pods. The plant is native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. Its pods, which resemble vanilla beans, contain a rich, aromatic flavor used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Due to its unique scent and limited cultivation, it is less commonly used than the more well-known vanilla planifolia.</p>
