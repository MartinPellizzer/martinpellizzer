<p>Vulpia ambigua, commonly known as the false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Vulpia ambigua is well adapted to harsh environments and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
