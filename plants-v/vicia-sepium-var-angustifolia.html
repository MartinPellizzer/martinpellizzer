<p>Vicia sepium var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf common vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in dense spikes, followed by elongated, twisted pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
