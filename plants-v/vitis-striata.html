<p>Vitis striata, commonly known as the streaked grapevine, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often striped stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis striata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
