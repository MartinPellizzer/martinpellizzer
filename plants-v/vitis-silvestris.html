<p>Vitis silvestris, commonly known as the wild grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the spring. The plant bears edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. Vitis silvestris is often found growing along riverbanks and in woodland areas, where it can climb trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in winemaking.</p>
