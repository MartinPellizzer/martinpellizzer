<p>Viola psammophila, commonly known as the sand viol, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Viola psammophila is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
