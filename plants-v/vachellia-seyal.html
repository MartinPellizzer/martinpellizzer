                    <h1>Vachellia seyal</h1>
<p>Vachellia seyal, commonly known as the false acacia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and feathery, and its yellow or golden-green flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Vachellia seyal is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.</p>
