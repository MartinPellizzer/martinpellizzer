<p>Vicia ecirrhosa, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock.
