                    <h1>Viola sabulosa</h1>
<p>Viola sabulosa, commonly known as the sand viol, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in the northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate violet flowers with five petals, typically in shades of purple or blue, during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>
<p>Viola sabulosa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
