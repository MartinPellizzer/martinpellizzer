<p>Vicia popovii, commonly known as the Popov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems that bear small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are typically dark brown in color. Vicia popovii is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species capable of thriving in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nitrogen-poor soils.</p>
