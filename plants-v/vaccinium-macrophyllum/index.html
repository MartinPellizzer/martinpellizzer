                            <h1>Vaccinium Macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium macrophyllum, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the western regions of the United States and parts of Canada. It is recognized for its dark green leaves and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal forests and mountainous areas. Its berries are not only enjoyed by humans but also serve as an important food source for wildlife. The evergreen huckleberry plays a significant role in both ecological systems and local culinary traditions.</p>
