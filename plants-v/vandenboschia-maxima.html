<p>Vandenboschia maxima, commonly known as the giant quiver tree, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Vandenboschia maxima is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
