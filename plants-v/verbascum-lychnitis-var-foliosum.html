                    <h1>Verbascum lychnitis var. foliosum</h1>
<p>Verbascum lychnitis var. foliosum, commonly known as the leafy mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features tall, erect stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other mullein species and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical medicinal uses.</p>
