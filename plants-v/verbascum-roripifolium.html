<p>Verbascum roripifolium, commonly known as the narrowleaf mullein, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a silvery-blue hue due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>Verbascum roripifolium is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
