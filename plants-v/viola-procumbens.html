                    <h1>Viola procumbens</h1>
<p>Viola procumbens, commonly known as the creeping violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, or white, which bloom in early spring. Viola procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat.</p>
