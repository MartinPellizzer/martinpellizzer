                    <h1>Vulpia geniculata subvar. hispida</h1>
<p>Vulpia geniculata subvar. hispida, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and areas with compacted soil.</p>
