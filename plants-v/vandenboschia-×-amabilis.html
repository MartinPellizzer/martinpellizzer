                    <h1>Vandenboschia × amabilis</h1>
<p>Vandenboschia × amabilis, commonly known as the hybrid ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Vandenboschia cordifolia and Vandenboschia humifusa, resulting in a plant with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
