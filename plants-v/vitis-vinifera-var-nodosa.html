                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. nodosa</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodose grape, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive nodular growth patterns on the stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically produces small, clustered berries with a deep purple color. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in wild or semi-wild settings.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptations and genetic diversity.</p>
