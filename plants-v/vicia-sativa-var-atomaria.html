                    <h1>Vicia sativa var. atomaria</h1>
<p>Vicia sativa var. atomaria, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
