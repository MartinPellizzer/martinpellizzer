<p>Viscum album subsp.</p>
<p>abietis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phylloids.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of sticky seeds by birds, which adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often associated with traditional customs and has cultural significance in various European regions.</p>
