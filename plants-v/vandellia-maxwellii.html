The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which is a key feature for identification. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
