                    <h1>Vanilla rubiginosa</h1>
<p>Vanilla rubiginosa, commonly known as the rough vanilla or black vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark brown pods that contain a rich, aromatic vanilla extract used in perfumes and food. Its botanical features include a complex root system and a preference for humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not closely related to the more commercially significant vanilla orchid, Vanilla planifolia.</p>
