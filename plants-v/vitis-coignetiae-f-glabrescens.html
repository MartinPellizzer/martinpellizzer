                    <h1>Vitis coignetiae f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Vitis coignetiae f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous fox grape, is a rare and ornamental variant of the fox grape species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and stems, distinguishing it from the typical form of Vitis coignetiae. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Vietnam, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, fragrant flowers and dark purple berries, which are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
