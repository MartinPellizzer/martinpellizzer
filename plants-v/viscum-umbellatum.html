                    <h1>Viscum umbellatum</h1>
<p>Viscum umbellatum, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by berries that are eaten by birds. These birds disperse the seeds, which then germinate on the bark of new host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum umbellatum is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is often associated with festive traditions during the holiday season.</p>
