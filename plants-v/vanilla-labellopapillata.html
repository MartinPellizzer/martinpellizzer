                    <h1>Vanilla labellopapillata</h1>
<p>Vanilla labellopapillata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing orchid that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by long, slender pods. The plant is characterized by its waxy, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant blooms. The vanilla-like scent of its flowers has made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and perfumery.</p>
<p>However, it is not related to the commercially cultivated vanilla (Vanilla planifolia).</p>
