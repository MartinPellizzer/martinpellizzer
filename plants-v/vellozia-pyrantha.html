<p>Vellozia pyrantha, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Mesembryanthemaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, umbrella-shaped inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it adapted to arid environments.</p>
