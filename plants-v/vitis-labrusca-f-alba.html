<p>Vitis labrusca f. alba, commonly known as the white fox grape, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the fox grape species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white berries, which contrast sharply with the typical dark purple color of most Vitis labrusca varieties. The plant is a deciduous vine with compound leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. It is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and is not commonly used for wine or table grapes.</p>
