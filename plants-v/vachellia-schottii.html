<p>Vachellia schottii, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Vachellia schottii is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
