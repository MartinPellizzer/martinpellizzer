                <h1>Vachellia oerfota</h1>
<p>Vachellia oerfota, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in compact inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>Vachellia oerfota plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat and forage for wildlife.</p>
