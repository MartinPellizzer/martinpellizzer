                    <h1>Viscum fragile</h1>
<p>Viscum fragile, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. Its leaves are evergreen, oval-shaped, and have a waxy surface, while its small white flowers appear in clusters. The plant produces small, sticky berries that are eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum fragile is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in many regions.</p>
