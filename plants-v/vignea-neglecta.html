<p>Vignea neglecta, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent.</p>
<p>Vignea neglecta is a carnivorous plant, relying on the captured prey for additional nutrients.</p>
