<p>Vaccinium tectiflorum, commonly known as the coastal blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which give it its common name. Its berries are edible, though they are generally small and somewhat tart.</p>
<p>Vaccinium tectiflorum plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife in its habitat.</p>
