                    <h1>Veronica hederifolia var. agrestis</h1>
<p>Veronica hederifolia var. agrestis, commonly known as the creeping speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
