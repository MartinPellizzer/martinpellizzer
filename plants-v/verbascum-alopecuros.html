                    <h1>Verbascum alopecuros</h1>
<p>Verbascum alopecuros, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its hairy foliage helps to retain moisture, making it well adapted to dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Verbascum alopecuros is often found in dry meadows, coastal areas, and disturbed habitats.</p>
