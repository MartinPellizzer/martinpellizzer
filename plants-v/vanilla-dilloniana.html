                    <h1>Vanilla dilloniana</h1>
<p>Vanilla dilloniana, commonly known as the mountain vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by long, thin pods resembling vanilla beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, making it a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
<p>The pods, though not used commercially like vanilla planifolia, are sometimes cultivated for their unique aroma and potential medicinal properties.</p>
