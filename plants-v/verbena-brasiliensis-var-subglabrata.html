                    <h1>Verbena brasiliensis var. subglabrata</h1>
<p>Verbena brasiliensis var. subglabrata, commonly known as Brazilian verbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "subglabrata" suggests a reduction in hairiness compared to the typical form. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
