<p>Viscum crassuloides, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Viscum crassuloides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
