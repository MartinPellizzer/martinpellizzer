                    <h1>Viguiera ovalis</h1>
<p>Viguiera ovalis, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. Viguiera ovalis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
