                    <h1>Vignantha drejeri var. alpina</h1>
<p>Vignantha drejeri var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine vignantha, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Vignantha drejeri var. alpina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
