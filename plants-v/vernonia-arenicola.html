                    <h1>Vernonia arenicola</h1>
<p>Vernonia arenicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vernonia arenicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
