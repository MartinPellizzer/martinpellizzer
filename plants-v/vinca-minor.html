                <h1>Vinca minor</h1>
<p>Vinca minor, commonly known as Persian shield, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ground cover due to its dense, spreading habit. It is drought-tolerant once established and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Vinca minor is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>
