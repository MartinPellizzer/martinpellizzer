<p>Vernonia calulu, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble misty clouds, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Vernonia calulu is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and pollinator attraction.</p>
