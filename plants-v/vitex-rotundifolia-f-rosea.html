                    <h1>Vitex rotundifolia f. rosea</h1>
<p>Vitex rotundifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the pink chaste tree, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a rounded base. It is typically grown for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The cultivar 'rosea' is distinguished by its pale pink flower color, which sets it apart from the more common purple-flowered varieties.</p>
