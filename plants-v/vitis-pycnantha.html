                    <h1>Vitis pycnantha</h1>
<p>Vitis pycnantha, commonly known as the Chinese wine grape, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in the spring, followed by bright red, grape-like berries in the fall. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and showy fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically used for winemaking, as its berries are not suitable for consumption.</p>
