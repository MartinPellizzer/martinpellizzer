<p>Vicia pseudovillosa, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Vicia pseudovillosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
