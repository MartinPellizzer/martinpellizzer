                    <h1>Vanilla penicillata</h1>
<p>Vanilla penicillata, commonly known as the golden vanilla, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical pods, which contain the aromatic vanilla beans. These beans are harvested when mature and dried to develop their characteristic flavor and fragrance.</p>
<p>Vanilla penicillata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its use in the production of vanilla extract.</p>
