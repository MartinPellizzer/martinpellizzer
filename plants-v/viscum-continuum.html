                    <h1>Viscum continuum</h1>
<p>Viscum continuum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by sticky, berry-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Viscum continuum has been historically associated with various cultural and mythological traditions across Europe.</p>
