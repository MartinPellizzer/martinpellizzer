                    <h1>Viscum moniliforme</h1>
<p>Viscum moniliforme, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its role in ecological interactions, including bird dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum moniliforme is also culturally significant, especially during the holiday season.</p>
