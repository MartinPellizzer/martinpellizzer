                            <h1>Varronia Guanacastensis</h1>
<p>Guanacaste tree, scientifically known as Varronia guanacastensis, is a striking tropical tree native to Central America. It is celebrated for its towering height and distinctive golden-yellow flowers that bloom in abundance during the dry season. This tree plays a vital role in the ecosystems of its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its durable wood has been historically used by indigenous communities for construction and crafts. Despite its ecological and cultural significance, the Guanacaste tree faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
