                    <h1>Vittaria coccygocarpa</h1>
<p>Vittaria coccygocarpa, commonly known as the spore-bearing fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
