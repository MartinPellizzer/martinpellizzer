<p>Verbascum vernale, commonly known as the common mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>

The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, fields, and wastelands. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
