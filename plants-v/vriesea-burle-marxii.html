                    <h1>Vriesea burle-marxii</h1>
<p>Vriesea burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a dramatic focal point in gardens. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is named after the Brazilian modernist architect Roberto Burle Marx, reflecting its bold and artistic visual appeal.</p>
