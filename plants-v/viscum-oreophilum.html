                    <h1>Viscum oreophilum</h1>
<p>Viscum oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in temperate and subtropical climates, thriving in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Viscum oreophilum is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions and ecological relationships.</p>
