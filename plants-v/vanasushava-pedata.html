<p>Vanasushava pedata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in riparian zones.</p>
