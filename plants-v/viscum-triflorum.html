                    <h1>Viscum triflorum</h1>
<p>Viscum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, sticky berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum triflorum is often found in forested areas and is an important part of the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
