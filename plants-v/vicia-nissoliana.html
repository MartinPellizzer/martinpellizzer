<p>Vicia nissoliana, commonly known as the Nissola vetch, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Vicia nissoliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
