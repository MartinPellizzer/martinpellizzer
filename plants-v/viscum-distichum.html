                    <h1>Viscum distichum</h1>
<p>Viscum distichum, commonly known as the common European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and apples.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, sticky berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides shelter for various insects and birds. Viscum distichum is often found in temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate the health of the host tree and the ecosystem it inhabits.</p>
