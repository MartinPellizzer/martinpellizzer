                    <h1>Vandellia humilis</h1>
<p>Vandellia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf vandellia, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale blue flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Vandellia humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
