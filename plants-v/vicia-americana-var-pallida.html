<p>Vicia americana var. pallida, commonly known as the pale yellow vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>As a member of the Fabaceae family, it is capable of nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients.</p>
