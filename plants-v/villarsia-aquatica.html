                    <h1>Villarsia aquatica</h1>
<p>Villarsia aquatica, commonly known as the water villarsia, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's edge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
