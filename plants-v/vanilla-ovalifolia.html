                    <h1>Vanilla ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Vanilla ovalifolia, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or vanilla tree, is a species of orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. Its fruit, a pod-like structure, contains aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural vanilla flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than vanilla planifolia.</p>
