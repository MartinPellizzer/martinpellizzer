<p>Vachellia tortilis subsp.</p>
<p>tortilis, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown formed by its dense, branching thorns.</p>
<p>The plant has small, compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, and it produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its thorns provide shelter for small animals, and its wood is used for fuel and construction in some regions.</p>
