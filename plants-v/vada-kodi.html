<p>Vada-kodi, commonly known as the "Indian nettle" or *Urena lobata*, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with branching stems that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, often with a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>Vada-kodi is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
