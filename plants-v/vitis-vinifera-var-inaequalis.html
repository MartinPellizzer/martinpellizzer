                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. inaequalis</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal grape, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique fruit morphology, with berries that vary in size and color across the same cluster. The plant typically grows as a vine, requiring support for its sprawling growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its potential in winemaking.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is less commonly used in commercial viticulture compared to other Vitis vinifera varieties.</p>
