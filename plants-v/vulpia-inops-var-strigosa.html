<p>Vulpia inops var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
