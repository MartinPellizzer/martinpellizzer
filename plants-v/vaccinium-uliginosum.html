                    <h1>Vaccinium uliginosum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It has small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and persist through the winter, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is well adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
