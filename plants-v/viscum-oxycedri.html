                    <h1>Viscum oxycedri</h1>
<p>Viscum oxycedri, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host tree through specialized root structures called haustoria. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum oxycedri is often associated with Christmas traditions due to its traditional use in festive decorations.</p>
