                    <h1>Vellozia rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Vellozia rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the knobstick plant, is a unique member of the Velloziaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and sparse, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Vellozia rhynchocarpa is notable for its slow growth and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
