                    <h1>Viscum linifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum linifolium, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by fleshy, sticky berries that are a food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum linifolium plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
