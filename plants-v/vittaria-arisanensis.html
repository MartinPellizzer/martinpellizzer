<p>Vittaria arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese sheet moss, is a small, evergreen epiphytic moss belonging to the family Vittariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral, with a distinctive midrib and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Vittaria arisanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
