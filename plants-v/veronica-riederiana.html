                    <h1>Veronica riederiana</h1>
<p>Veronica riederiana, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Veronica riederiana is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
