                    <h1>Varasia aquatica</h1>
<p>Varasia aquatica, commonly known as the water varasia, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Varasia aquatica is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
