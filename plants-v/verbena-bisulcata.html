<p>Verbena bisulcata, commonly known as narrowleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought resistance.</p>
<p>Verbena bisulcata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
