<p>Vincetoxicum eurychitoides, commonly known as the red-veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets that have distinctive red veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Vincetoxicum eurychitoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
