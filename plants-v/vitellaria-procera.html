                    <h1>Vitellaria procera</h1>
<p>Vitellaria procera, commonly known as shea tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Sahel region of Africa, where it thrives in dry, tropical climates. The tree is valued for its large, edible seeds, which are processed into shea butter, a valuable cosmetic and industrial product. Its thick, waxy leaves provide shade and help reduce soil erosion in arid environments.</p>
<p>The shea tree plays a crucial role in both local ecosystems and economies, supporting biodiversity and providing livelihoods for many communities.</p>
