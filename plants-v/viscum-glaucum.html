                    <h1>Viscum glaucum</h1>
<p>Viscum glaucum, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Viscum glaucum is often found in temperate regions and is a common sight in forested areas during the winter months.</p>
