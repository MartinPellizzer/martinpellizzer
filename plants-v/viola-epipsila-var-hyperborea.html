                    <h1>Viola epipsila var. hyperborea</h1>
<p>Viola epipsila var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or tundra habitats where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, violet or purple flowers with five petals. It is adapted to survive in harsh climates through mechanisms such as compact growth and deep root systems.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other viola species but is distinguished by its extreme northern distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
