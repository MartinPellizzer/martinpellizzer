                    <h1>Viola petrophila</h1>
<p>Viola petrophila, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in high-altitude, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with five petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Viola petrophila is considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
