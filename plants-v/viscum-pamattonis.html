<p>Viscum pamattonis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, leathery structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for bird dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Viscum pamattonis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, though it can also weaken its host tree over time.</p>
