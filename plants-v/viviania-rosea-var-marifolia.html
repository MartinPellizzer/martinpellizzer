                    <h1>Viviania rosea var. marifolia</h1>
<p>Viviania rosea var. marifolia, commonly known as the pink mangrove, is a halophyte species that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and salt absorption. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an essential component of mangrove forests in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
