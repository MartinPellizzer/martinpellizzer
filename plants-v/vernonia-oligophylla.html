<p>Vernonia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments.</p>
<p>Vernonia oligophylla is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
