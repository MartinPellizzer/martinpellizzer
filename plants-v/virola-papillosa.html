                    <h1>Virola papillosa</h1>
<p>Virola papillosa, commonly known as the pink mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing numerous seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and durability, making it a sought-after timber species.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Virola papillosa is now considered vulnerable in many parts of its range.</p>
