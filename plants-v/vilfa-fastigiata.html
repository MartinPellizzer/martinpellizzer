                    <h1>Vilfa fastigiata</h1>
<p>Vilfa fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and often appear before the leaves fully emerge. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish in color, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age.</p>
