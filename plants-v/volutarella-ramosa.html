<p>Volutarella ramosa, commonly known as the branched bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems bear numerous bladders used for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Volutarella ramosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
