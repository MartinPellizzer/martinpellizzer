                    <h1>Viscum portulacoides</h1>
<p>Viscum portulacoides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on various species of oak trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's tissues. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
