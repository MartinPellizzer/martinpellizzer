                    <h1>Veitchia petiolata</h1>
<p>Veitchia petiolata, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
