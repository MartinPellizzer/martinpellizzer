<p>Ventricularia tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in ponds or wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
