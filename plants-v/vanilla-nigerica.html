                    <h1>Vanilla nigerica</h1>
<p>Vanilla nigerica, commonly known as the African vanilla or West African vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species found in its native habitat. The plant's most notable feature is its dark brown, aromatic vanilla pods, which are harvested and cured to develop their characteristic flavor. Vanilla nigerica thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination requirements, it is less commonly cultivated commercially compared to vanilla planifolia.</p>
