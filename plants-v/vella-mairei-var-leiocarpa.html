                    <h1>Vella mairei var. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Vella mairei var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited vella, is a rare and lesser-known species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, smooth, and often glabrous fruits, which distinguish it from other varieties within the species. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent venation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
