<p>Vicia nodosa, commonly known as the nodding vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early spring. Vicia nodosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it an important plant in soil enrichment.</p>
