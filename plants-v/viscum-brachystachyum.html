<p>Viscum brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties.</p>
<p>Viscum brachystachyum is often found in humid, shaded environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
