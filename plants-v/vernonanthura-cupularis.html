                    <h1>Vernonanthura cupularis</h1>
<p>Vernonanthura cupularis, commonly known as the cupular lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, leathery thallus that provides protection against desiccation. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in regions with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
