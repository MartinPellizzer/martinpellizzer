<p>Vachellia farnesiana var. pinetorum, commonly known as the gum tree or acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and long, slender pods that contain the seeds. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system for water absorption. It produces a resinous gum that has been used traditionally for medicinal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
