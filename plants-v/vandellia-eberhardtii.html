<p>Vandellia eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's vandellia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to fire-prone environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salt exposure and strong coastal winds. Its morphology features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
