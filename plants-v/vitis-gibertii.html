                    <h1>Vitis gibertii</h1>
<p>Vitis gibertii, commonly known as the Gibert's grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and France. The plant is characterized by its woody vines, heart-shaped leaves, and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically small and dark, containing a single seed, and are not commonly cultivated for food.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis gibertii is considered a botanically significant but endangered species.</p>
