                    <h1>Vicia communis var. remrevillensis</h1>
<p>Vicia communis var. remrevillensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with narrow, pointed leaflets that give the plant its common name. This variety is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
