<p>Valerianella sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-seeded sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring. Valerianella sclerocarpa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a tough, waxy coating, which helps them endure harsh environments and ensures better germination when conditions are favorable.</p>
