<p>Verbesina argentea, commonly known as silverleaf beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is an annual or biennial herb with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread widely across its native range.</p>
