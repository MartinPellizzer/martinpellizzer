                    <h1>Vellozia tubiflora</h1>
<p>Vellozia tubiflora, commonly known as the tubular vellozia, is a rare and striking member of the Santalaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, fibrous bark and produces small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
