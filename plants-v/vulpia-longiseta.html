<p>Vulpia longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are often covered with fine, bristly hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
