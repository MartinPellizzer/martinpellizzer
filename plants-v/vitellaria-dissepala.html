                    <h1>Vitellaria dissepala</h1>
<p>Vitellaria dissepala, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical fruits that split open to reveal a hard shell enclosing a fatty seed. The seeds are rich in oils and are the primary source of shea butter, which has significant economic and medicinal value.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in both local ecosystems and traditional economies across its native range.</p>
