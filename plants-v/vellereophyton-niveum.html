                    <h1>Vellereophyton niveum</h1>
<p>Vellereophyton niveum, commonly known as the snow-dusted lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, harsh conditions. The plant's thallus is typically white or pale in color, giving it a distinctive appearance in its alpine habitat. It is often found on rocky surfaces or tree bark in regions with high humidity and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to colonize extreme environments and contribute to soil formation in alpine ecosystems.</p>
