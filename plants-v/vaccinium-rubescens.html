                    <h1>Vaccinium rubescens</h1>
<p>Vaccinium rubescens, commonly known as the red highbush blueberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, typically growing in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which give way to bright red berries in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also edible, though they are less commonly consumed than other blueberry varieties.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
