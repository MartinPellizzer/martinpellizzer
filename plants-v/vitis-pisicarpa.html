                    <h1>Vitis pisicarpa</h1>
<p>Vitis pisicarpa, commonly known as the grapefruit vine, is a rare and less-studied member of the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to攀附 various structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, orange-red fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five lobes and a distinctive, aromatic odor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
