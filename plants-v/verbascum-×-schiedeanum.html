<p>Verbascum × schiedeanum, commonly known as the hybrid mullein, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Verbascum blattaria and Verbascum blattellum, both native to southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green leaves that resemble those of common mullein. It produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
