                    <h1>Vitis riparia var. praecox</h1>
<p>Vitis riparia var. praecox, commonly known as the early river grape, is a wild vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found along riverbanks and in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in viticulture for its cold hardiness and potential for hybridization.</p>
