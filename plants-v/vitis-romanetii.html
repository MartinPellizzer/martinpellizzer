<p>Vitis romanetii, commonly known as the Romanet grapevine, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its berries are typically small and dark, with a tart flavor, and are used in local winemaking traditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vitis romanetii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
