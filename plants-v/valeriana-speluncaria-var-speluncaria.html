                    <h1>Valeriana speluncaria var. speluncaria</h1>
<p>Valeriana speluncaria var. speluncaria, commonly known as the cave valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as limestone caves and rocky crevices, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has dark green, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, aiding in moisture retention. Its small, pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of volatile oils.</p>
