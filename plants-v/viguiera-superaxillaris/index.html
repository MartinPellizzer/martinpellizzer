<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Viguiera superaxillaris, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant blue flowers that bloom in late summer, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This perennial herb thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an adaptable and resilient plant for various landscapes. Despite its beauty, Blueweed is sometimes mistaken for invasive species, highlighting the importance of proper identification and cultivation practices.</p>
