<p>Verbena maritima, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Verbena maritima plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dune environments.</p>
