                    <h1>Viscum mysorense</h1>
<p>Viscum mysorense, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Viscum mysorense is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
