<p>Viscum jamaicense, commonly known as the Jamaican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a unique structure with a hemispherical shape and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fruits, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Viscum jamaicense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
