<p>Vicia azurea, commonly known as the blue vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Vicia azurea is often found in open habitats like meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges.</p>
