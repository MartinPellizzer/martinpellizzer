                    <h1>Viscum henslovii</h1>
<p>Viscum henslovii, commonly known as the Henslow's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a unique symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are small, fleshy, and serve as a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum henslovii is often found in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
