                    <h1>Vincetoxicum officinale var. floribundum</h1>
<p>Vincetoxicum officinale var. floribundum, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
