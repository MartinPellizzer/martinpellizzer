<p>Vitekorchis vasquezii, commonly known as the Vasquez's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
