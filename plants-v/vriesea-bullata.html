The plant produces bright orange flowers that bloom in a spiky inflorescence, often reaching several feet in height. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea bullata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
