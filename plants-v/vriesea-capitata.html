<p>Vriesea capitata, commonly known as the Royal Vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and a dense cluster of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, sword-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Vriesea capitata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
