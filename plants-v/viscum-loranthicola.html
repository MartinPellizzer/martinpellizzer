<p>Viscum loranthicola, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Viscum loranthicola relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in supporting bird populations that consume its berries.</p>
