                    <h1>Verbascum spectabile var. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Verbascum spectabile var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous mullein, is a striking plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is notable for its variable leaf shapes, which can range from broad to narrow, giving it its botanical name.</p>
<p>This variation in leaf morphology is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other varieties of verbascum.</p>
