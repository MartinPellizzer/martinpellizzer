                    <h1>Vanilla armoriquensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla armoriquensis, commonly known as the Atlantic vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the coastal regions of West Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its vanilla pods, which develop from the fertilized flowers, are harvested and processed to extract the aromatic essence.</p>
<p>Despite its potential, it is less commercially cultivated compared to the more widely known Vanilla planifolia.</p>
