<p>Vitis pedata, commonly known as the creeping grape or wild grapevine, is a deciduous vine native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet berries that ripen in the fall. Vitis pedata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses.</p>
