                    <h1>Viscum rubrum</h1>
<p>Viscum rubrum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are attached to the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Viscum rubrum has a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to the host tree's decline over time.</p>
<p>It is also known for its cultural significance, especially during the Christmas season.</p>
