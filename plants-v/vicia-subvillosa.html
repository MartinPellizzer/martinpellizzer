                    <h1>Vicia subvillosa</h1>
<p>Vicia subvillosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Vicia subvillosa is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
