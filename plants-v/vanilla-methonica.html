                    <h1>Vanilla methonica</h1>
<p>Vanilla methonica, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla orchid, is a climbing tropical orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, dark brown pods that contain the highly valued vanilla beans used in flavoring. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with partial shade and well-draining soil. Its growth is slow, requiring several years to mature and produce flowers and fruit.</p>
<p>The vanilla beans are harvested when the pods turn from green to yellowish-brown, then cured and dried to develop their rich aroma.</p>
