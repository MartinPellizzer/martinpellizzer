                    <h1>Vanilla pleei</h1>
<p>Vanilla pleei, commonly known as the mountain vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by the characteristic vanilla-like pods, which develop after a prolonged flowering period. These pods are fragrant and contain the aromatic compounds responsible for the flavor of vanilla.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and the potential for its vanilla-like scent, Vanilla pleei is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
