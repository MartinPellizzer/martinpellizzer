                    <h1>Viscum wrayi</h1>
<p>Viscum wrayi, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature means it derives some of its nutrients from the host tree, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Viscum wrayi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting biodiversity through its fruit and habitat.</p>
