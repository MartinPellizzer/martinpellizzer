<p>Vanieria tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-pointed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vanieria tricuspidata plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
