                    <h1>Vanilla axillaris</h1>
<p>Vanilla axillaris, commonly known as the small vanilla orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture.</p>
<p>The vanilla-like scent of its flowers is a distinctive feature, though it does not produce the commercial vanilla extract found in vanilla planifolia.</p>
