<p>Vittaria furcata, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, forked structures known as sorus. Vittaria furcata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within the fern family.</p>
