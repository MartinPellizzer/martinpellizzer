                    <h1>Veronica pageana</h1>
<p>Veronica pageana, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and mat-forming structure. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Veronica pageana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high elevations.</p>
