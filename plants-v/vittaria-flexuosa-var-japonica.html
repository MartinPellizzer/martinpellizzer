<p>Vittaria flexuosa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese chain fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, cascading foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vittaria flexuosa var. japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique, fern-like appearance.</p>
