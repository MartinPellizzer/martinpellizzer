                    <h1>Vandellia cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Vandellia cavaleriei, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped flower arrangement, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a unique visual element to the forest understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vandellia cavaleriei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
