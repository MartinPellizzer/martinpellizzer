<p>Vulpia australis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf veldt grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
