                    <h1>Veronica hjuleri</h1>
<p>Veronica hjuleri, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, harsh environment.</p>
<p>Veronica hjuleri is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in areas with low nutrient availability.</p>
