                            <h1>Verbesina Sinuata</h1>
<p>Verbesina sinuata, commonly known as the zigzagged goldenrod, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the southeastern United States. This herbaceous perennial is recognized for its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks. With its showy blooms and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and native wildlife. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure compared to more widely cultivated ornamental plants.</p>
