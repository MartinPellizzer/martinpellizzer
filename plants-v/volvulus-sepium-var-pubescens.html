                    <h1>Volvulus sepium var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Volvulus sepium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has thin, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its variety name. It thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition.</p>
