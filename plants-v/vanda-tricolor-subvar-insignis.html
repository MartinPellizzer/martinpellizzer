                    <h1>Vanda tricolor subvar. insignis</h1>
<p>Vanda tricolor subvar. insignis, commonly known as the Three-color Vanda, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display red, white, and yellow hues in a unique tri-color pattern. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adapted for storing water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care.</p>
