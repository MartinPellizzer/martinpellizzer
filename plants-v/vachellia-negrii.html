<p>Vachellia negrii, commonly known as the Negri's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Vachellia negrii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native regions.</p>
