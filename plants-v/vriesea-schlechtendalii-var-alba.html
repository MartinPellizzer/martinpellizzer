                    <h1>Vriesea schlechtendalii var. alba</h1>
<p>Vriesea schlechtendalii var. alba, commonly known as the white Vriesea, is a bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white-painted leaves that form a rosette shape, with a central cup that collects water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in succession. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
