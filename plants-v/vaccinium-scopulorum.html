<p>Vaccinium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making them valuable for both wildlife and human consumption.</p>
<p>Vaccinium scopulorum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests.</p>
