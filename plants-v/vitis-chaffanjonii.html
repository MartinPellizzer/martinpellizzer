<p>Vitis chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon grapevine, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by black, grape-like berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
