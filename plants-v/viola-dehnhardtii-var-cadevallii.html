<p>Viola dehnhardtii var. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii violet, is a rare and striking member of the Violaceae family.</p>

The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces vibrant violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists.</p>
