                    <h1>Vicia sativa var. villosa</h1>
<p>Vicia sativa var. villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing several seeds. Hairy vetch is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
