                    <h1>Vigna wittei</h1>
<p>Vigna wittei, commonly known as the African horse bean, is a leguminous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces elongated pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds that are often used as food. Vigna wittei is adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
