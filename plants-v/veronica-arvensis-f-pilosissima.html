                    <h1>Veronica arvensis f. pilosissima</h1>
<p>Veronica arvensis f. pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is a member of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other common garden plants.</p>
