                    <h1>Vriesea vitellina</h1>
<p>Vriesea vitellina, commonly known as the Golden Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of orange and yellow, which can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea vitellina is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
