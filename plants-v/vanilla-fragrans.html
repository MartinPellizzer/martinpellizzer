                    <h1>Vanilla fragrans</h1>
<p>Vanilla fragrans, commonly known as the vanilla orchid, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Mexico and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bee species. The plant's most valuable part is its fruit, a dark brown pod containing tiny seeds, which is harvested and processed to create vanilla extract. The vanilla bean undergoes a complex curing process involving drying, sweating, and aging to develop its rich flavor and aroma.</p>
<p>This plant is highly valued in the food and fragrance industries for its unique scent and taste.</p>
