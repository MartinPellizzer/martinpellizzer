<p>Vincetoxicum quercetorum, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils.</p>
<p>The berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in traditional medicine once fully mature.</p>
