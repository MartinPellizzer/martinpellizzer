                    <h1>Vermicularia decurrens</h1>
<p>Vermicularia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous and not showy. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
