<p>Vittaria stipitata, commonly known as the button fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, clustered fronds that resemble miniature ferns. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Vittaria stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
