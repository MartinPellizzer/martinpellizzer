                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. braquet</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. braquet, commonly known as Braquet grape, is a lesser-known variety of Vitis vinifera, primarily cultivated in specific regions of France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intensely flavored berries that are typically used for producing high-quality wines. The plant exhibits typical Vitis vinifera growth habits, including vigorous vines and a preference for temperate climates. Its leaves are lobed and have a deep green color, while the flowers are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, Braquet remains a niche variety, valued for its unique aromatic profile and complexity in wine.</p>
