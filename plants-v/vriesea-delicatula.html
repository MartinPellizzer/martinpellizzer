                    <h1>Vriesea delicatula</h1>
<p>Vriesea delicatula, commonly known as the miniature Vriesea, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in warm climates.</p>
