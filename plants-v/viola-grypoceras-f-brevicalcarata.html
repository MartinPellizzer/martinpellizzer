                    <h1>Viola grypoceras f. brevicalcarata</h1>
<p>Viola grypoceras f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred violet, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Alps. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, violet-blue flowers with short, spurred petals. Its foliage often has a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
