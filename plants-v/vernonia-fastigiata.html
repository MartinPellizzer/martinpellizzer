<p>Vernonia fastigiata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Vernonia fastigiata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
