                    <h1>Vitellaria tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Vitellaria tenuifolia, commonly known as shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food.</p>
<p>The plant is also important for soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
