                    <h1>Vicoa discoidea</h1>
<p>Vicoa discoidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and elongated, white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
