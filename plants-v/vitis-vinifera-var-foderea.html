                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. foderea</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. foderea, commonly known as the Fodera grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark-colored berries and is primarily grown in specific regions of Italy. The plant exhibits typical viticultural features, including vigorous growth and a tendency to produce clusters of fruit. Its botanical traits make it suitable for niche wine production and historical cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated today due to its limited yield and specific climatic requirements.</p>
