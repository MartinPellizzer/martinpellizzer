                    <h1>Vaccaria liniflora</h1>
<p>Vaccaria liniflora, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Vaccaria liniflora is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
