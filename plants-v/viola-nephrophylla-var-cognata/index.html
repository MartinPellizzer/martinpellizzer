                            <h1>Viola Nephrophylla Var. Cognata</h1>
<p>Cape cod violet, scientifically known as Viola nephrophylla var. cognata, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the coastal regions of New England. This low-growing plant features heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the shores and is often found in protected habitats such as dunes and salt marshes. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the cape cod violet is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a symbol of the fragile natural heritage of the region.</p>
