<p>Vaccinium neglectum var. harbisonii, commonly known as the Harbison's blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring. These flowers give way to edible, bright red berries that are similar in taste to highbush blueberries.</p>
<p>It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as pine forests and wetlands.</p>
