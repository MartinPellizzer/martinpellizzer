                    <h1>Vyenomus</h1>
<p>Vyenomus, commonly known as the poison vine, is a climbing plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to climb structures make it both a useful and hazardous plant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Vyenomus is often found in moist, shaded areas where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
