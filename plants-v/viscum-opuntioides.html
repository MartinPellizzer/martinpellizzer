                    <h1>Viscum opuntioides</h1>
<p>Viscum opuntioides, commonly known as the opuntia mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of cacti, particularly species of Opuntia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy, leaf-like structures called phylloclades. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Viscum opuntioides is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role involves both parasitizing cacti and providing food for various bird species.</p>
