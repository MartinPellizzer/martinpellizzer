                    <h1>Vittaria incurvata</h1>
<p>Vittaria incurvata, commonly known as the curling fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that curl inward, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Vittaria incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
