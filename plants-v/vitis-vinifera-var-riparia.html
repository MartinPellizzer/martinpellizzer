<p>Vitis vinifera var. riparia, commonly known as river grape, is a wild grapevine native to the banks of rivers in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and adaptability to moist, sandy soils. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically not consumed fresh but are used in winemaking or as forage for wildlife. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it has compound tendrils that aid in climbing.</p>
<p>This species is often used in viticulture for its cold hardiness and resistance to certain diseases.</p>
