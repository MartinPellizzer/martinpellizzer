<p>Verbena connatibracteata f. rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Verbena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette-like growth habit with closely packed, narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and prolonged flowering period.</p>
