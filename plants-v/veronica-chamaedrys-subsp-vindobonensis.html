<p>Veronica chamaedrys subsp.</p>
<p>vindobonensis, commonly known as the alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July.</p>
<p>The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
