<p>Verbascum nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>abietinum, commonly known as the black mullein, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, fuzzy gray-green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage are adaptations to its arid habitat, aiding in water retention and protection from herbivores.</p>
