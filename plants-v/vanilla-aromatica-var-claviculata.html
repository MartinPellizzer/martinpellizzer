                    <h1>Vanilla aromatica var. claviculata</h1>
<p>Vanilla aromatica var. claviculata, commonly known as the club-shaped vanilla, is a rare and lesser-known variety of vanilla orchid.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces long, slender pods that are typically smaller than those of the more common vanilla planifolia. Its unique morphology, characterized by the club-like shape of its flowers, sets it apart from other vanilla species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized growing conditions, it is rarely cultivated outside of its natural habitat.</p>
