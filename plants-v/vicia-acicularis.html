<p>Vicia acicularis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Vicia acicularis is often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
