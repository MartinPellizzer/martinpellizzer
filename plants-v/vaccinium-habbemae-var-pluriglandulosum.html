                    <h1>Vaccinium habbemae var. pluriglandulosum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium habbemae var. pluriglandulosum, commonly known as the hairy whorled blueberry, is a variant of the Vaccinium genus, which includes various species of blueberries and cranberries.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and potential for hybridization with other Vaccinium species.</p>
