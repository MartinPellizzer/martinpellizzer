                    <h1>Viscum macrofalcatum</h1>
<p>Viscum macrofalcatum, commonly known as the large-leaved European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as oaks and pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are thick and leathery. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by gelatinous berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
