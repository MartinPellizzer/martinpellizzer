<p>Verbascum giganteum subsp.</p>
<p>martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's mullein, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
