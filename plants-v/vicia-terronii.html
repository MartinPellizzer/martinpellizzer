                    <h1>Vicia terronii</h1>
<p>Vicia terronii, commonly known as the Terron's vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Vicia terronii thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root system.</p>
