                    <h1>Valeriana sambucifolia f. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Valeriana sambucifolia f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruited valerian, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the valerian family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive smooth, elongated fruits and heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of elderberry. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a mild, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
