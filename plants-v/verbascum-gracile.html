<p>Verbascum gracile, commonly known as the slender mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Verbascum gracile is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
