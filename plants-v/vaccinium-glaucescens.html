<p>Vaccinium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 30â€“60 cm and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blue-black berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are used both in traditional indigenous practices and in modern culinary applications.</p>
<p>Vaccinium glaucescens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
