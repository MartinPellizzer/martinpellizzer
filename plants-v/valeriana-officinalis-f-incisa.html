                    <h1>Valeriana officinalis f. incisa</h1>
<p>Valeriana officinalis f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf valerian, is a botanical variant of the common valerian.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically pink or white, and it blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented than those of the standard valerian.</p>
