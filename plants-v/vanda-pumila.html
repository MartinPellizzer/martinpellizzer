                    <h1>Vanda pumila</h1>
<p>Vanda pumila, commonly known as the slender vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its leaves are usually elongated and somewhat leathery, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Vanda pumila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
