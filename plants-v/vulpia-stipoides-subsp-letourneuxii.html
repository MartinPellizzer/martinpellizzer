<p>Vulpia stipoides subsp.</p>
<p>letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's fescue, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, compact clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, awned spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
