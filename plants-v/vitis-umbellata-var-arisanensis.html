<p>Vitis umbellata var. arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan grapevine, is a rare and native species of the Vitaceae family found primarily in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
