<p>Vitis quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Jeju grapevine, is a rare and endemic species native to Jeju Island, South Korea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous vine that produces small, dark purple berries, which are typically used in local winemaking. The plant has a distinctive heart-shaped leaf and thrives in the unique microclimate of Jeju's volcanic soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected under South Korean law.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic uniqueness and ecological role in the region's biodiversity.</p>
