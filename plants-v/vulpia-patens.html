                    <h1>Vulpia patens</h1>
<p>Vulpia patens, commonly known as the common vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Vulpia patens is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting early-stage ecosystems.</p>
