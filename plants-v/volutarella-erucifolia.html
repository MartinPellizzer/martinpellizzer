                    <h1>Volutarella erucifolia</h1>
<p>Volutarella erucifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic prey, such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant has thin, delicate stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. It thrives in stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can efficiently capture and digest nutrients from its prey.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
