                    <h1>Vittaria arunachalensis</h1>
<p>Vittaria arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vittariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vittaria arunachalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
