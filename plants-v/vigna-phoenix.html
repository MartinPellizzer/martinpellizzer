                    <h1>Vigna phoenix</h1>
<p>Vigna phoenix, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual legume that produces small, pale green pods containing edible seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring deep roots and a hairy, waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Vigna phoenix is valued for its hardiness and potential as a sustainable crop in dryland agriculture.</p>
