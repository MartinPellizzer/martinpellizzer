                    <h1>Vinca pumila</h1>
<p>Vinca pumila, commonly known as the creeping jewelsplant, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled, sky-blue or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it ideal for ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread horizontally make it an effective weed suppressor in woodland settings.</p>
