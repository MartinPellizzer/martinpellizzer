                    <h1>Vincetoxicum luteum</h1>
<p>Vincetoxicum luteum, commonly known as yellow woodbine, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks, often climbing trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its invasive tendencies in some regions.</p>
