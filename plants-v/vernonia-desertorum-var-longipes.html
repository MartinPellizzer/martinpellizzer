The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
