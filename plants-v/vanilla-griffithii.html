                    <h1>Vanilla griffithii</h1>
<p>Vanilla griffithii, commonly known as the giant vanilla or giant orchid, is a tropical climbing orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, vine-like stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are similar in appearance to the more well-known vanilla planifolia. These pods are not typically used for vanilla extraction but are valued for their ornamental beauty and unique fragrance.</p>
<p>Vanilla griffithii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs.</p>
