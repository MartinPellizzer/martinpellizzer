<p>Viola tricolor var. degener, commonly known as the Dutch violet, is a variant of the common violet with distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It typically features three-colored petals—purple, yellow, and white—that are more pronounced than in the standard Viola tricolor. This variety is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland edges and meadows. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>It is a short-lived perennial, often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
