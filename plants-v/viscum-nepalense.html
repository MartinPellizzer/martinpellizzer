                    <h1>Viscum nepalense</h1>
<p>Viscum nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, sticky berries that contain seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in moist, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
