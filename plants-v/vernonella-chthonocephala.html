                <h1>Vernonella chthonocephala</h1>
<p>Vernonella chthonocephala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Vernonella chthonocephala is considered an endangered species.</p>
