                    <h1>Vitis assimilis</h1>
<p>Vitis assimilis, commonly known as the Chinese sand grape, is a species of flowering vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into clusters of small, round berries. These berries are edible but are not commonly consumed due to their tart flavor and high acidity.</p>
<p>Vitis assimilis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has some historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
