<p>Viscum wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, as it derives some of its nutrients from the host plant while also photosynthesizing.</p>
<p>Viscum wallichianum is an important component of the ecological systems it inhabits.</p>
