<p>Vaccinium vacciniaceum subsp.</p>
<p>glabritubum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blueberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which give way to blue-black berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems, which set it apart from other members of the Vaccinium genus.</p>
