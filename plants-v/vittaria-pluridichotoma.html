<p>Vittaria pluridichotoma, commonly known as the forked moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of bryophyte ecology.</p>
