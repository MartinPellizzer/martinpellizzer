<p>Verbascum obtusifolium, commonly known as the woolly mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used historically for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Verbascum obtusifolium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapic gardens.</p>
