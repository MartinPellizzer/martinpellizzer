<p>Vesiculina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and often float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Vesiculina pygmaea is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and prey capture for survival.</p>
