                    <h1>Viscum japonicum</h1>
<p>Viscum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are often red or yellow. It is native to East Asia, including Japan, Korea, and China, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
