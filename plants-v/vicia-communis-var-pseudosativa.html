<p>Vicia communis var. pseudosativa, commonly known as the common vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its tolerance to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
