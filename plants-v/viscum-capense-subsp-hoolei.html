<p>Viscum capense subsp.</p>
<p>hoolei, commonly known as the coastal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It primarily grows on the branches of acacia trees and other host species, relying on them for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and typically arranged in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and salt spray.</p>
