                    <h1>Vallisneria spiralis var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Vallisneria spiralis var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf waterweed, is a compact aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that grow in dense, submerged clusters, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that develop underwater and are followed by elongated, spiral-shaped fruits. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft to moderately hard water conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its low light and nutrient requirements, it is a popular choice for aquariums and pond landscaping.</p>
