<p>Vulpia uniglumis, commonly known as the slender vulpia, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in well-drained environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Vulpia uniglumis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
