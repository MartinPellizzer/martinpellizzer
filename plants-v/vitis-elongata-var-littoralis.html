                    <h1>Vitis elongata var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Vitis elongata var. littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh grape, is a perennial vine native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by clusters of small, edible berries. It thrives in brackish or saline soils along tidal marshes and estuaries.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
