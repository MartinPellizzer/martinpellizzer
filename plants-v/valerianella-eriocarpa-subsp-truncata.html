<p>Valerianella eriocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive truncate (cut-off) appearance at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, fuzzy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
