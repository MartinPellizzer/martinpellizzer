                    <h1>Vulpia geniculata var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Vulpia geniculata var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
