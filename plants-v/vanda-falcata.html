<p>Vanda falcata, commonly known as the sickle vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive sickle-shaped lip that gives the species its common name.</p>
<p>Vanda falcata thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
