                    <h1>Vicia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Vicia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a small, annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its modest size and adaptability, it is often overlooked but ecologically significant in certain habitats.</p>
