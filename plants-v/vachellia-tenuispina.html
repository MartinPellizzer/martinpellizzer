                    <h1>Vachellia tenuispina</h1>
<p>Vachellia tenuispina, commonly known as the slender thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Vachellia tenuispina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
