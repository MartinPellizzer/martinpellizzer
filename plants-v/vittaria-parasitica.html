                    <h1>Vittaria parasitica</h1>
<p>Vittaria parasitica, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its rhizomes, which anchor it to host plants. The plant's fronds are delicate and often have a translucent appearance, giving it its common name. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and appearance, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
