<p>Vella pseudocytisus subsp.</p>
<p>glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries that are a food source for birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
