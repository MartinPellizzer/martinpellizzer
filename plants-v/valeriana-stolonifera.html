                    <h1>Valeriana stolonifera</h1>
<p>Valeriana stolonifera, commonly known as creeping valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread via stolons, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic, and it produces small, pink or white flowers in umbel-like clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Valeriana stolonifera is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its calming effects.</p>
