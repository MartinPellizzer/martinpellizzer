                    <h1>Vitis heterophylla var. elegans</h1>
<p>Vitis heterophylla var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant grapevine, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either lobed or simple depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and distinctive features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
