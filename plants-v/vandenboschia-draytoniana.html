                    <h1>Vandenboschia draytoniana</h1>
<p>Vandenboschia draytoniana, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped growth with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Vandenboschia draytoniana is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
