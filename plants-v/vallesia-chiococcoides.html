<p>Vallesia chiococcoides, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Vallesia chiococcoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
