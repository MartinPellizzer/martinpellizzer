                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. multiloba</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. multiloba, commonly known as the multilobed grapevine, is a lesser-known variety of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to other Vitis species. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, sour grapes that are not typically used for winemaking but are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens rather than commercial vineyards.</p>
