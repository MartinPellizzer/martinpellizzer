                    <h1>Vicia communis var. uncinata</h1>
<p>Vicia communis var. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
