<p>Vachellia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>subalata, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow to orange globular flower heads, which are arranged in dense clusters. It is well adapted to drought, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used for its hardy nature and is sometimes planted for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
