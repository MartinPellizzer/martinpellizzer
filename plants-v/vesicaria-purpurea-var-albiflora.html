                    <h1>Vesicaria purpurea var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Vesicaria purpurea var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are predominantly white, with some pink or purple hues, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than its purple-flowered counterpart, making it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
