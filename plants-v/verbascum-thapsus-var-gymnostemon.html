                    <h1>Verbascum thapsus var. gymnostemon</h1>
<p>Verbascum thapsus var. gymnostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, velvety leaves that are narrower than the typical variety. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its reduced leaf size and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
