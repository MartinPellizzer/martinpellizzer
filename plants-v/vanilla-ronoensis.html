                    <h1>Vanilla ronoensis</h1>
<p>Vanilla ronoensis, commonly known as the Madagascar vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific species of bees. The plant's most valuable part is its elongated, dark brown pod, which develops after successful pollination. The pods are harvested, cured, and dried to produce the aromatic vanilla extract used in culinary and perfumery industries.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Vanilla ronoensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
