<p>Vesicaria gemonensis, commonly known as the Gemonian bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Lake Garda region in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments with soft, muddy substrates. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its reproductive structures are specialized for water dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Vesicaria gemonensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
