<p>Vanilla rivasii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, dark purple pods that are harvested for their aromatic qualities. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically yellow with a deep violet throat, and it requires a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for proper development.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Vanilla rivasii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
