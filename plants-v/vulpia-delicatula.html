                    <h1>Vulpia delicatula</h1>
<p>Vulpia delicatula, commonly known as the slender vulpia, is a small annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Vulpia delicatula plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
