<p>Vauquelinia californica subsp.</p>
<p>californica, commonly known as the California broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native landscaping in coastal areas.</p>
