                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. alicantia</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. alicantia, commonly known as Alicant grape, is a variety of Vitis vinifera native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick-skinned berries that are typically harvested early in the growing season. The plant is a vigorous vine with deep roots and can thrive in a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. It is often used in the production of rosé and fortified wines due to its aromatic profile and early ripening nature.</p>
<p>The leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is generally resistant to common grapevine diseases.</p>
