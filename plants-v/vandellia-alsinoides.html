                    <h1>Vandellia alsinoides</h1>
<p>Vandellia alsinoides, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in dryland ecosystems.</p>
