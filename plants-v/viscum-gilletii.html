                    <h1>Viscum gilletii</h1>
<p>Viscum gilletii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and attaches itself to host trees such as Acacia and Combretum, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its evergreen leaves are ovate to lanceolate, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in winter. The plant also bears small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
