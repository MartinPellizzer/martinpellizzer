<p>Vicia capensis, commonly known as the Cape vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume that produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
<p>Vicia capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control.</p>
