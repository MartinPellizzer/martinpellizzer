<p>Viviania calycina, commonly known as the Trinidadian waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
