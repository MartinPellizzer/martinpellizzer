<p>Verbascum splendidum, commonly known as the splendid mullein, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, woolly hairs. The leaves are large, broad, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, forming clusters at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
