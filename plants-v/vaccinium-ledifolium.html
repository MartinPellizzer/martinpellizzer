                    <h1>Vaccinium ledifolium</h1>
<p>Vaccinium ledifolium, commonly known as the trailing blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers give way to edible berries that are typically blue or purple in color, though they are not as large or sweet as those of other blueberry species.</p>
<p>Vaccinium ledifolium is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and mountainous regions.</p>
