                    <h1>Veronica hederifolia var. eriocalyx</h1>
<p>Veronica hederifolia var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trailing stems that produce small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion.</p>
