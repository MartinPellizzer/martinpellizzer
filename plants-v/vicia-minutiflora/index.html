                            <h1>Vicia Minutiflora</h1>
<p>Vicia minutiflora is a small, annual legume native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is known for its tiny, pea-like flowers and its ability to thrive in poor soils. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in nitrogen fixation and supports local insect populations. Its resilience and adaptability make it a valuable species in ecological studies.</p>
