<p>Vicia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Vicia sessiliflora produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
