                    <h1>Vitis setosa</h1>
<p>Vitis setosa, commonly known as the creeping or wild grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. Vitis setosa is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and along trails, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
