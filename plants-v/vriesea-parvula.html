                    <h1>Vriesea parvula</h1>
<p>Vriesea parvula, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a compact evergreen plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, short-lived inflorescences with red and orange bracts, often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea parvula is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
