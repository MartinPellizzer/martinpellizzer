                    <h1>Vitis coignetiae var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Vitis coignetiae var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf fox grape, is a rare and ornamental vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage rather than for fruit production. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat.</p>
