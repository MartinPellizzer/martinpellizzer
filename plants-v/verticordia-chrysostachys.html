                    <h1>Verticordia chrysostachys</h1>
<p>Verticordia chrysostachys, commonly known as the golden beard or golden broom, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive yellow floral spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Verticordia chrysostachys is well-suited to rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
