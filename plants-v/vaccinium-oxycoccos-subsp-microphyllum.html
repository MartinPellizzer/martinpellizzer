<p>Vaccinium oxycoccos subsp.</p>
<p>microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by dark blue or black berries. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and densely packed, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Vaccinium oxycoccos.</p>
