<p>Vernonia reducta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to brownish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Vernonia reducta is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems and a potential candidate for restoration projects.</p>
