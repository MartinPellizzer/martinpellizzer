<p>Vanilla cardinalis, commonly known as the Mexican vanilla or the cardinal vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, vanilla-scented pods that are used in both culinary and aromatic applications. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces striking red flowers that are often pollinated by specific bee species. Its vanilla flavor is milder compared to the more widely known vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a trellis for support as it climbs.</p>
