<p>Velleia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate velleia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are borne on short pedicels. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a creeping stem that allows it to spread across the soil surface.</p>
<p>Velleia prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
