                    <h1>Vriesea psittacina var. rubrobracteata</h1>
<p>Vriesea psittacina var. rubrobracteata, commonly known as the red-bract Vriesea, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear small, white flowers, which are less showy than the bracts.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded indoor environments.</p>
