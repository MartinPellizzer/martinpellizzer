                    <h1>Vitis vinifera var. carnosa</h1>
<p>Vitis vinifera var. carnosa, commonly known as the hairy grape, is a lesser-known cultivar of the common grapevine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and thick, rugged stems, which provide a unique texture compared to other grape varieties. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its berries are typically small and less sweet than those of table grapes, making it more suitable for winemaking or ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is not widely cultivated commercially.</p>
