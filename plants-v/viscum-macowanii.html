<p>Viscum macowanii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa and Madagascar. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesis provides some of its own energy.</p>
<p>Viscum macowanii plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting certain bird species that consume its berries.</p>
