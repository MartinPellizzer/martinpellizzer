                    <h1>Viola calcarata var. rosularis</h1>
<p>Viola calcarata var. rosularis, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to rocky and dry environments. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue or purple flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, typical of the Violaceae family. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
