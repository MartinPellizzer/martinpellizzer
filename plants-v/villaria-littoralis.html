<p>Villaria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Villaria littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
