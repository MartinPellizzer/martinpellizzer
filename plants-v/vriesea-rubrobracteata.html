<p>Vriesea rubrobracteata, commonly known as the red-bract vriesea, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic and eye-catching appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its rosette of narrow, dark green leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The flowering period occurs in the summer, producing a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, often yellow or orange flowers.</p>
