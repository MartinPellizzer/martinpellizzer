                    <h1>Vriesea caespitosa</h1>
<p>Vriesea caespitosa, commonly known as the tussock bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Vriesea caespitosa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
