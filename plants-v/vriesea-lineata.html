<p>Vriesea lineata, commonly known as the sword fern bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are stiff and pointed, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. Vriesea lineata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections.</p>
