<p>Vachellia bullockii, commonly known as the Bullock's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Vachellia bullockii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
