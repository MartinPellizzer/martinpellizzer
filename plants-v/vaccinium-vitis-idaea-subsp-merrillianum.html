<p>Vaccinium vitis-idaea subsp.</p>
<p>merrillianum, commonly known as the dwarf bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants, and thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are similar in appearance to true blueberries but are typically smaller and more tart. Its leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its dense, carpet-like growth habit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as heathlands, rocky slopes, and forest edges.</p>
