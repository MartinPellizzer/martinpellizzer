                    <h1>Vaccinium nycteroides</h1>
<p>Vaccinium nycteroides, commonly known as the evening dewberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. Its berries are typically dark purple to black and are edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Vaccinium species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
