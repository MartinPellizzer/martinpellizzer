<p>Vitis simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's grape, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine that produces small, clustered berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
