<p>Viola rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>orioli-bolosii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre violet, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of violet or purple, with five petals arranged in a typical violet-like pattern. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
