<p>Veprecella rosea, commonly known as the rose flower beetle, is a small, brightly colored beetle species belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in Europe and parts of Asia, where it inhabits gardens and wildflower habitats. The beetle's body is typically adorned with vibrant pink or red hues, which serve as a form of aposematic coloration to deter predators. Veprecella rosea primarily feeds on plants in the Rosaceae family, such as roses and other flowering shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in pollination and plant herbivory, it plays a minor but significant part in local ecosystems.</p>
