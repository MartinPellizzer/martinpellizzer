<p>Vulpia geniculata, commonly known as bent grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Vulpia geniculata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
