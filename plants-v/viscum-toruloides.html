                    <h1>Viscum toruloides</h1>
<p>Viscum toruloides, commonly known as the dwarf European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily oaks.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it relies on birds for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Viscum toruloides is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage.</p>
