                    <h1>Viola allchariensis f. pinifolia</h1>
<p>Viola allchariensis f. pinifolia, commonly known as the Alpine violet, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
