<p>Vicia cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep violet, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds.</p>
<p>Vicia cuspidata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
