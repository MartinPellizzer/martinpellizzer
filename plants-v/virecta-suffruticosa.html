<p>Virecta suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique coloration. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range.</p>
