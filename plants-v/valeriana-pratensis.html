<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a distinctive appearance with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its roots and leaves. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
