<p>Vincetoxicum glaucirameum, commonly known as the blue-rayed false bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
