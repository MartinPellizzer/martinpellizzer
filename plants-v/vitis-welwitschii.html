                    <h1>Vitis welwitschii</h1>
<p>Vitis welwitschii, commonly known as the Namib Desert grape, is a unique vine species native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that minimize water loss. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants and have been used traditionally by local communities. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Vitis welwitschii is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for developing drought-tolerant crops.</p>
