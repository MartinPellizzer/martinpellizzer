<p>Vinca minor var. azurea, commonly known as blue vinca or smallflower blue carpet, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that provide a lush ground cover. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and rockeries.</p>
