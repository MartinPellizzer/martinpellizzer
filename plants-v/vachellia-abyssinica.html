<p>Vachellia abyssinica, commonly known as the African burr acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow, globular inflorescences that attract various pollinators. The plant produces small, flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, spiky covering. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Vachellia abyssinica also has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood.</p>
