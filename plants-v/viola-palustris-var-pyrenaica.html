                    <h1>Viola palustris var. pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Viola palustris var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean marsh violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms low-growing, spreading mats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with five petals. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Viola palustris.</p>
