                    <h1>Vicia amurensis var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Vicia amurensis var. pratensis, commonly known as the Amur vetch, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
