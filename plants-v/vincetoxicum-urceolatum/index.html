                            <h1>Vincetoxicum Urceolatum</h1>
<p>Cuckoo's beak, scientifically known as Vincetoxicum urceolatum, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to Europe and parts of Asia. This perennial shrub is recognized for its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its common name derives from the unique shape of its flowers, which resemble a bird's beak. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
