                    <h1>Vanilla angustipetala</h1>
<p>Vanilla angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vanilla, is a climbing orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bees. The plant's slender, vine-like stems can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb trees and other vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The orchid is valued for its unique aroma, though it is less commonly cultivated than other vanilla species.</p>
