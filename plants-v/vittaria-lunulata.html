<p>Vittaria lunulata, commonly known as the moon's moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Vittariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique morphology with a stalk-like structure called a stipe, which supports the fertile leaves. Vittaria lunulata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
