                    <h1>Viscum buxifolium</h1>
<p>Viscum buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy berries containing sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating the plant's spread.</p>
<p>Viscum buxifolium plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
