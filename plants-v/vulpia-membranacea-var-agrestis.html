                    <h1>Vulpia membranacea var. agrestis</h1>
<p>Vulpia membranacea var. agrestis, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions makes it a common pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
