                    <h1>Vanilla rubra</h1>
<p>Vanilla rubra, commonly known as red vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces striking red flowers with a velvety texture and a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires a support structure for its climbing habit.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not typically used for vanilla flavoring, unlike its more famous relative, Vanilla planifolia.</p>
