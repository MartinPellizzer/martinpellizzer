                    <h1>Vittaria intramarginalis</h1>
<p>Vittaria intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal vittaria, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, mat-like growth on tree bark or rocks. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the fern family. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Vittaria intramarginalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
