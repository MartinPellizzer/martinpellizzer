<p>Vachellia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid thornveld acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Vachellia rigidula is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
