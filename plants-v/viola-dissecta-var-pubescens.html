                    <h1>Viola dissecta var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Viola dissecta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive downward-curving spur that houses nectar, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and resist herbivory, making it well adapted to woodland and shaded environments.</p>
