                    <h1>Verhuellia hydrocotylifolia</h1>
<p>Verhuellia hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in aquatic or wetland environments.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to thrive in shallow water, making it a common sight in marshes and ponds.</p>
