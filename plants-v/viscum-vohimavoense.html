<p>Viscum vohimavoense, commonly known as the Vohimavo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Viscum vohimavoense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
