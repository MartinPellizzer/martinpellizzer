<p>Vigna marina, commonly known as the sea bean, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual legume that thrives in sandy, saline soils near the ocean. The plant produces small, green pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Vigna marina is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecological balance in beach ecosystems.</p>
