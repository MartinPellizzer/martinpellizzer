                    <h1>Vriesea gradata</h1>
<p>Vriesea gradata, commonly known as the star sapphire bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Vriesea gradata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance.</p>
