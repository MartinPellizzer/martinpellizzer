The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
