                    <h1>Vanilla × tahitensis var. haapape</h1>
<p>Vanilla × tahitensis var. haapape, commonly known as Tahitian vanilla, is a tropical orchid species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, dark brown pods that develop from the pollination of its unique, self-pollinating flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure and the presence of a specialized pollinator, the Melipona bee, which is essential for fruit set.</p>
<p>The vanilla beans harvested from this variety are prized for their rich, complex flavor and are widely used in culinary and fragrance applications.</p>
