                    <h1>Vincetoxicum aphyllum</h1>
<p>Vincetoxicum aphyllum, commonly known as the nakedleaf thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to distinctive, spiny, orange-red berries that mature in the fall.</p>
<p>Vincetoxicum aphyllum is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
