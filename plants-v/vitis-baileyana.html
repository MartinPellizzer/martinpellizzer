<p>Vitis baileyana, commonly known as the Bailey's muscat grape, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth, producing tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its small, fragrant flowers appear in clusters and are followed by clusters of small, yellow-green grapes.</p>
<p>Vitis baileyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and sometimes edible fruits.</p>
