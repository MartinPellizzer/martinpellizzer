                    <h1>Viscum album var. laxum</h1>
<p>Viscum album var. laxum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily oaks and apple trees.</p>
<p>It has a dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for birds. Its growth is slow, and it can live for many years, often forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Viscum album var. laxum plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity, particularly in forest ecosystems.</p>
