                    <h1>Vermifrux</h1>
<p>Vermifrux, commonly known as the earthworm plant, is a unique species with a symbiotic relationship with earthworms.</p>
<p>Its roots secrete a substance that attracts and nourishes earthworms, which in turn help aerate the soil and enhance nutrient cycling. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments, often found in temperate forest floors. Vermifrux has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces delicate, white flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Its ecological role highlights the intricate connections between plants and soil organisms in maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>
