                    <h1>Viscum lophiocladum var. lophiocladum</h1>
<p>Viscum lophiocladum var. lophiocladum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in the canopy of forests where it forms a symbiotic relationship with its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host tree.</p>
