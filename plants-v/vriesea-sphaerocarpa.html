<p>Vriesea sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil.</p>

The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that remain for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Vriesea sphaerocarpa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
