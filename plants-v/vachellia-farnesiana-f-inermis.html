                    <h1>Vachellia farnesiana f. inermis</h1>
<p>Vachellia farnesiana f. inermis, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by legume pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by the absence of thorns, making it less defensive but more suitable for certain horticultural applications.</p>
