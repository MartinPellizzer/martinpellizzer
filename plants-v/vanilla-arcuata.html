                    <h1>Vanilla arcuata</h1>
<p>Vanilla arcuata, commonly known as the zigzag vanilla, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging growth pattern and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its vanilla-like aroma comes from the scent of its flowers, though it does not produce the same type of vanilla beans as Vanilla planifolia.</p>
<p>This species is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and pleasant fragrance.</p>
