<p>Viola rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>relicta, commonly known as the relic violet, is a rare and endangered species native to the rocky habitats of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in limestone or sandstone soils. Its flowers have five petals, with the lower petal often marked with a distinctive yellow or white blotch.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
