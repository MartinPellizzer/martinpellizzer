<p>Vaccaria pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Vaccaria pyramidalis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
