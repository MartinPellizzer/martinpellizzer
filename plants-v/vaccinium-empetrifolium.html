<p>Vaccinium empetrifolium, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other acid-loving plants such as heathers and blueberries. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often covered in a fine white wax, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>The berries, though small, are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine.</p>
