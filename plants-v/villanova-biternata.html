                    <h1>Villanova biternata</h1>
<p>Villanova biternata, commonly known as the three-leaved forest fern, is a perennial plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that split into three narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
