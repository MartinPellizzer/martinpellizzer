<p>Vicia leptantha, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Vicia leptantha is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
