<p>Vriesea tarmaensis, commonly known as the Tarma Vriesea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of Peru and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can range in color from yellow to orange, are produced in a spiral arrangement and are highly attractive to pollinators.</p>
