<p>Vandenboschia parva, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a small succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
