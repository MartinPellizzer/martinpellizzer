                    <h1>Valeriana californica</h1>
<p>Valeriana californica, commonly known as California valerian, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. It is known for its strong, sometimes disagreeable fragrance, which is due to the presence of volatile oils.</p>
<p>Valeriana californica is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine.</p>
