<p>Viscum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>Viscum humbertii has a complex life cycle, relying on its host for water and nutrients while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat.</p>
