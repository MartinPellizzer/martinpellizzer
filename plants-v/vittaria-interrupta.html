                    <h1>Vittaria interrupta</h1>
<p>Vittaria interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, linear fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive interrupted pattern.</p>
<p>Vittaria interrupta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
