<p>Volkensinia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate volkensia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
