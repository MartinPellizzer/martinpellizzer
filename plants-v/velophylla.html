<p>Velophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a unique species native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features waxy, silver-tinted leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters to protect itself from harsh conditions. Its flowers are small and pale, typically appearing in clusters during the spring.</p>
<p>Velophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-moisture landscapes.</p>
