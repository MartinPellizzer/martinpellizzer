                    <h1>Vilfa littoralis</h1>
<p>Vilfa littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Vilfa littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal insects.</p>
