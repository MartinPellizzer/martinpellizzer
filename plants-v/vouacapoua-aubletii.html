<p>Vouacapoua aubletii, commonly known as the "Amazonian rosewood," is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
