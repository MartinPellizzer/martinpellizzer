<p>Vitis trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including China, India, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it the "hairy" descriptor in its common name.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers are followed by clusters of berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color.</p>
