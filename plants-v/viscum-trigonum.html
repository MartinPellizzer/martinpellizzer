                    <h1>Viscum trigonum</h1>
<p>Viscum trigonum, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oak and apple.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Viscum trigonum is often associated with Christmas traditions, though its ecological role is more complex than its festive symbolism suggests.</p>
