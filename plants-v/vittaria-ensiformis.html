<p>Vittaria ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Vittaria ensiformis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
