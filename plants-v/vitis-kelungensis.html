<p>Vitis kelungensis, commonly known as the Chinese fox grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known vines such as grapes and Virginia creeper. The plant is characterized by its tendrils, heart-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically dark purple or black when mature and are not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Vitis kelungensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
