                    <h1>Vachellia farnesiana f. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Vachellia farnesiana f. brachypoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved umbrella thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. Its roots can fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects.</p>
