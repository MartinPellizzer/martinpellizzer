                    <h1>Vaccinium corymbosum f. leucococcum</h1>
<p>Vaccinium corymbosum f. leucococcum, commonly known as the white-berried blueberry, is a botanical variant of the common blueberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white or very light blue berries, which contrast with the typical deep blue color of the species. This form is a naturally occurring variant, often found in specific geographic regions where the climate and soil conditions favor its development. The plant retains the typical shrub structure of Vaccinium corymbosum, with small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its unique berry coloration makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural breeding programs.</p>
