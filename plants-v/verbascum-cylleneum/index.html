<p>Verbascum cylleneum, commonly known as the Cyprus mullein, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, fuzzy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers, which range from yellow to orange, bloom in late spring and attract various pollinators. Despite its beauty, it is sometimes mistaken for other mullein species due to its similar appearance.</p>
