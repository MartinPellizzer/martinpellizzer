                    <h1>Viscum stenocarpum</h1>
<p>Viscum stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are small and sticky, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Viscum stenocarpum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with host plants and wildlife.</p>
