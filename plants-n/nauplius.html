                    <h1>Nauplius</h1>
<p>Nauplius, commonly known as the larval stage of crustaceans, is not a plant but a type of aquatic larva.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a simple body structure with a single eye, a pair of antennae, and biramous appendages. Nauplii are typically found in marine and freshwater environments, where they feed on plankton. They undergo a series of metamorphosis stages before developing into adult crustaceans.</p>
<p>This stage is crucial for the life cycle of many species within the phylum Arthropoda.</p>
