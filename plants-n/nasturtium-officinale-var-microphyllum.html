<p>Nasturtium officinale var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, edible flowers that come in shades of orange and yellow. The plant grows low to the ground, typically reaching a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible parts.</p>
<p>The variety is closely related to the common nasturtium, but its smaller size and unique appearance set it apart.</p>
