                    <h1>Neosasamorpha iwamiana</h1>
<p>Neosasamorpha iwamiana, commonly known as the Iwamiana fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
