<p>White longan, scientifically known as Nephelium longana var. hypoleucum, is a unique variant of the longan fruit that stands out for its pale, almost white flesh. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is prized for its delicate flavor and nutritional value. Unlike the more common longan, the white longan has a thinner skin and a softer texture, making it a delicacy in certain regions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit, which is enjoyed in both fresh and processed forms. Due to its rarity and distinct characteristics, the white longan remains a subject of interest among botanists and food enthusiasts alike.</p>
