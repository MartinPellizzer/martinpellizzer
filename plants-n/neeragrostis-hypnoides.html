<p>Neeragrostis hypnoides, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that often carpet the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and establish thick stands.</p>
