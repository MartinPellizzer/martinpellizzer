<p>Nastanthus sanjuaninus, commonly known as the San Juan devil's ivy, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped, waxy leaves that exhibit a striking change in color from green to red as the plant matures. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the late spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nastanthus sanjuaninus is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
