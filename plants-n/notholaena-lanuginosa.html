                    <h1>Notholaena lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Notholaena lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called soruses. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
