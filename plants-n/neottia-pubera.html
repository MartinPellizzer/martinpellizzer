                    <h1>Neottia pubera</h1>
<p>Neottia pubera, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, photosynthetic structures called phyllodes. Neottia pubera is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain fungi.</p>
