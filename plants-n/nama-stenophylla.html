                    <h1>Nama stenophylla</h1>
<p>Nama stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nama, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Nama stenophylla is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
