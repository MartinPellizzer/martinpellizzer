                    <h1>Neosepicaea</h1>
<p>Neosepicaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neosepicaea has small, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
