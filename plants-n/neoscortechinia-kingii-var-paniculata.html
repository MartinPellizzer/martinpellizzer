                    <h1>Neoscortechinia kingii var. paniculata</h1>
<p>Neoscortechinia kingii var. paniculata, commonly known as the king's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on specific host trees for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern and southeastern United States, where it typically grows on the branches of oaks and hickories. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, giving it its species name. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
