                    <h1>Narcissus reflexus proles pulchellus</h1>
<p>Narcissus reflexus proles pulchellus, commonly known as the slender daffodil, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) tepal arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
