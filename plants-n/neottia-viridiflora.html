<p>Neottia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports its small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
