                    <h1>Notocactus minimus var. ruoffii</h1>
<p>Notocactus minimus var. ruoffii, commonly known as the Ruoff's miniature cactus, is a small, slow-growing species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive rib structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its compact size and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
