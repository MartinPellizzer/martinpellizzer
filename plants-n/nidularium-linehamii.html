                    <h1>Nidularium linehamii</h1>
<p>Nidularium linehamii, commonly known as the Hawaiian starling fern, is a rare and unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforest understories. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-like fronds that are composed of overlapping, strap-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with sporangia developing on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nidularium linehamii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
