                    <h1>Nephrodium platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
