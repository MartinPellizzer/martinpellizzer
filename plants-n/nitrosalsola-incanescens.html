<p>Nitrosalsola incanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to harsh climates.</p>
