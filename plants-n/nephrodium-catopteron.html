<p>Nephrodium catopteron, commonly known as the mirror fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically bi-lobed and have a strikingly symmetrical appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium catopteron make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
