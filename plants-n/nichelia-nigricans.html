                    <h1>Nichelia nigricans</h1>
<p>Nichelia nigricans, commonly known as the black mold or black bread mold, is a dimorphic fungus that exhibits both filamentous and yeast-like growth forms.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic organism, typically found on decaying organic matter such as bread, fruits, and other plant materials. The fungus produces dark, velvety colonies that are often visible to the naked eye. Its spores are dispersed through the air and can thrive in moist, warm environments.</p>
<p>Nichelia nigricans lacks chlorophyll and does not perform photosynthesis, relying solely on decomposing organic substances for nutrients.</p>
