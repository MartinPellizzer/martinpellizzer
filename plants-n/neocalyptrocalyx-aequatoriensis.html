                    <h1>Neocalyptrocalyx aequatoriensis</h1>
<p>Neocalyptrocalyx aequatoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian star moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort found in humid, shaded environments of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped thallus with a distinct central groove. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a calyptra, which protects the developing sporangia. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
