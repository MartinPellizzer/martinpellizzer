<p>Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora, commonly known as the fragrant white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically bisexual and arranged in pairs, giving it the "biflora" designation. Its fruits are small, dark purple drupes that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished from the more common Nyssa sylvatica by its unique floral structure and fragrance.</p>
