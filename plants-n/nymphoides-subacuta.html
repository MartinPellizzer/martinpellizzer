<p>Nymphoides subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Nymphoides subacuta is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
