                    <h1>Nephrodium pilosohispidum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium pilosohispidum, commonly known as the hairy-horned fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnae segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this fern provides insights into the evolution and adaptation of ferns in diverse ecological niches.</p>
