                    <h1>Nephrodium sparsum var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sparsum var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
