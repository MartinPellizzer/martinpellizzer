<p>Noccaea virens, commonly known as creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Noccaea virens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
