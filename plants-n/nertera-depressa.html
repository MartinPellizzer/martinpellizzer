                    <h1>Nertera depressa</h1>
<p>Nertera depressa, commonly known as the silver velvet plant, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are not particularly showy but add a subtle touch of beauty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Nertera depressa is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing growth habit.</p>
