<p>Nephrolepis lindsayae, commonly known as Lindsay's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
