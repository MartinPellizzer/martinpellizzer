<p>Neovriesia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neovriesia macrostachya is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
