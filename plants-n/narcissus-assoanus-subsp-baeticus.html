<p>Narcissus assoanus subsp.</p>
<p>baeticus, commonly known as the Baetican daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a white center, typically blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem that supports its single flower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
