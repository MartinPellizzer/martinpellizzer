                    <h1>Neoporteria litoralis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Neoporteria litoralis var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a variant of the coastal neoporteria species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
