<p>Nephrodium panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian kidney fern, is a tropical plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns.</p>
