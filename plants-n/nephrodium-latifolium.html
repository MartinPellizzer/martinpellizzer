<p>Nephrodium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved nephroid, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
