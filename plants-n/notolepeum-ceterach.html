<p>Notolepeum ceterach, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is well adapted to salty sea air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Notolepeum ceterach is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
