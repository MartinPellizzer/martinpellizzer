                    <h1>Nectalisma natans</h1>
<p>Nectalisma natans, commonly known as the floating nectalisma, is a rare aquatic plant found in still freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of mucilage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its reproductive strategy involves the dispersal of buoyant seeds through water currents.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
