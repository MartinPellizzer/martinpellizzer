<p>Nassella tucumana, commonly known as Tucum√°n needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Nassella tucumana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage.</p>
