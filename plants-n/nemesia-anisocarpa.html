                    <h1>Nemesia anisocarpa</h1>
<p>Nemesia anisocarpa, commonly known as the variable-flowered nemesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces two types of flowersâ€”showy ones for pollination and smaller, less conspicuous ones for seed production. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Nemesia anisocarpa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
