                    <h1>Nageia gnidioides</h1>
<p>Nageia gnidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nageia, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araucariaceae family, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features include a slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
