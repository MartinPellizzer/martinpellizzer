<p>Nigritella angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>corneliana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nigritella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
