<p>Neltuma nuda, commonly known as the naked neltuma, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to soft pink, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer months. Neltuma nuda thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
