                    <h1>Nephrodium melanorachis</h1>
<p>Nephrodium melanorachis, commonly known as the black-veined nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive dark green, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are bipinnate, with closely spaced, dark brown veins that give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as temperate rainforests. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
