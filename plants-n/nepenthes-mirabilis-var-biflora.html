                    <h1>Nepenthes mirabilis var. biflora</h1>
<p>Nepenthes mirabilis var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered pitcher plant, is a unique variant of the *Nepenthes mirabilis* species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce two distinct types of pitchersâ€”some specialized for trapping insects and others for attracting nectar-feeding animals. The plant features elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures lined with a waxy coating and a rim that secretes a sweet nectar. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are borne on a separate inflorescence, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variant is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
