                    <h1>Neja montevidensis</h1>
<p>Neja montevidensis, commonly known as the Uruguay nettle, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its stinging hairs, it can be a defensive mechanism against herbivores and humans.</p>
