                    <h1>Narcissus bulbocodium var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Narcissus bulbocodium var. genuinus, commonly known as the Spanish daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower with a cup-shaped corona. The plant produces a bulbous root system that allows it to survive in poor, dry soils. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
