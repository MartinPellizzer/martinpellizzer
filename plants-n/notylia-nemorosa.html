                    <h1>Notylia nemorosa</h1>
<p>Notylia nemorosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface or hang from submerged stems. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Notylia nemorosa plays a role in water filtration and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
