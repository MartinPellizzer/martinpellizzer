<p>Nonea melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited nonea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. Its fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Nonea melanocarpa is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
