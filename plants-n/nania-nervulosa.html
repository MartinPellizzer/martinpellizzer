<p>Nania nervulosa, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders.</p>
<p>These bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, such as insects and crustaceans, for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in whorls along the stem.</p>
<p>Nania nervulosa is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
