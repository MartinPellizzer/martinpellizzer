                    <h1>Notodanthonia longifolia</h1>
<p>Notodanthonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically long and narrow, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal or inland grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature and drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native environments.</p>
