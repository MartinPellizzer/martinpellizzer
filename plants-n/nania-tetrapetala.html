                    <h1>Nania tetrapetala</h1>
<p>Nania tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled nania, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Nania tetrapetala is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
