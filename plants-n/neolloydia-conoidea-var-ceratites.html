<p>Neolloydia conoidea var. ceratites, commonly known as the horned neolloydia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved leaves that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
