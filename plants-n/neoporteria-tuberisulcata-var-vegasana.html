                    <h1>Neoporteria tuberisulcata var. vegasana</h1>
<p>Neoporteria tuberisulcata var. vegasana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
