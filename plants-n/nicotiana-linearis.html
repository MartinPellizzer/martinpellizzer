<p>Nicotiana linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Nicotiana linearis is also used in scientific research due to its genetic similarities to other tobacco species.</p>
