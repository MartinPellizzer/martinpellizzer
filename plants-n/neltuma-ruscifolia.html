                    <h1>Neltuma ruscifolia</h1>
<p>Neltuma ruscifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf fern, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, almost fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Neltuma ruscifolia plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms.</p>
