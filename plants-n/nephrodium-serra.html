                    <h1>Nephrodium serra</h1>
<p>Nephrodium serra, commonly known as the serrated nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of pinnae, which are finely serrated along their edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are often bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
