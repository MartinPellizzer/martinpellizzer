                    <h1>Niedzwedzkia</h1>
<p>Niedzwedzkia, commonly known as the "Polish snowdrop," is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Poland.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, humid environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, stout stem that supports its solitary flower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Niedzwedzkia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
