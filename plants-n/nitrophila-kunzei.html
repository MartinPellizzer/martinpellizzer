                    <h1>Nitrophila kunzei</h1>
<p>Nitrophila kunzei, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has slender, erect stems with whorled leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Nitrophila kunzei is noted for its specialized relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake, particularly nitrogen.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant-fungal interactions and ecological adaptations.</p>
