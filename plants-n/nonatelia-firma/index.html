                            <h1>Nonatelia Firma</h1>
<p>Common ice plant, scientifically known as Nonatelia firma, is a hardy succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. This plant is named for its ability to exude a crystalline substance when crushed, which resembles ice under the sun. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The Common ice plant is prized for its resilience and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and ability to store water in its fleshy leaves make it an ideal plant for drought-prone environments.</p>
