<p>Nephrodium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of dark green, needle-like leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Nephrodium rigidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
