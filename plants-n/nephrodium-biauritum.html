                    <h1>Nephrodium biauritum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium biauritum, commonly known as the two-auricle fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded auricles along the leaf margins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Nephrodium biauritum provides insight into the evolutionary adaptations of ferns in diverse ecological niches.</p>
