                    <h1>Nepenthes ampullaria var. vittata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes ampullaria var. vittata, commonly known as the striped pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that are often adorned with distinctive yellow stripes. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its digestive fluid, where they are broken down and absorbed. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can grow quite long, contributing to its overall appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique coloration and specialized adaptations for capturing prey.</p>
