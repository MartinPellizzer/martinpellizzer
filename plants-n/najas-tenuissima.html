<p>Najas tenuissima, commonly known as slender watermilfoil, is a small, aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Najadaceae family and typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed.</p>
