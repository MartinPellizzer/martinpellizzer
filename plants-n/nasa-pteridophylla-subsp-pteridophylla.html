<p>Nasa pteridophylla subsp.</p>
<p>pteridophylla, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
