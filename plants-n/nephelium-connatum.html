<p>Nephelium connatum, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves.

The fruit's pericarp is divided into segments called "arils," which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>It is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
