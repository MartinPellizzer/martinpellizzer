                    <h1>Namataea</h1>
<p>Namataea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the forest floor. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and rich, well-draining soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Namataea is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
