                    <h1>Neptunia virgata</h1>
<p>Neptunia virgata, commonly known as the water fern or floating fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Neptunia virgata is also known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a biofilter in ponds.</p>
