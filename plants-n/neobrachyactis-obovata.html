<p>Neobrachyactis obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, stiff, obovate leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
