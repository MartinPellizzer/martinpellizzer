                    <h1>Narcissus paedagogorum</h1>
<p>Narcissus paedagogorum, commonly known as the teacher's daffodil, is a rare and ancient species of daffodil native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a single, upright greenish-yellow tepal that resembles a teacher's staff, giving it its historical name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It blooms in early spring, producing flowers that are both ornamental and historically significant.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
