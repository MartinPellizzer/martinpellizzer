<p>Nephrodium devolvens, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, curling fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Carolinas. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dark green, bipinnate leaves that unfurl as they mature. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium devolvens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
