                    <h1>Notholaena candida</h1>
<p>Notholaena candida, commonly known as the white leaching fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green to white hue, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
