                    <h1>Nepenthes campanulata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes campanulata, commonly known as the bell pitcher vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped pitchers that are often filled with water to trap prey. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured insects. Nepenthes campanulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous behavior make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
