                    <h1>Neurotheca</h1>
<p>Neurotheca, commonly known as the "sac of the nerves," is a specialized plant structure found in certain species of orchids.</p>
<p>It is a small, sac-like organ that develops at the base of the flower stem and is involved in the secretion of nectar. This structure plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The neurotheca is often modified in shape and size depending on the species and its ecological needs.</p>
<p>Its presence is a distinctive botanical feature that aids in the identification of specific orchid genera.</p>
