                    <h1>Nepenthes armbrustae</h1>
<p>Nepenthes armbrustae, commonly known as the Armbruster's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highland forests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant red coloration, often with yellow or green markings, serves to attract prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
