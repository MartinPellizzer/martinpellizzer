<p>Nipponocalamus koshisimonii, commonly known as the Koshisimon bamboo, is a rare and endangered species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
