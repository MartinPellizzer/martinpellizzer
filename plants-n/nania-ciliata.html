                    <h1>Nania ciliata</h1>
<p>Nania ciliata, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a compact, raceme-like structure. Nania ciliata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
