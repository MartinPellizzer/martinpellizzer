                    <h1>Novopokrovskia nigromontana</h1>
<p>Novopokrovskia nigromontana, commonly known as the black mountain bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its compact, low-growing habit. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
