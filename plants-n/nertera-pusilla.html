<p>Nertera pusilla, commonly known as the baby tears plant, is a small, trailing succulent native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features tiny, rounded leaves that are typically bright green, though they can vary in color depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in gardens.</p>
