                    <h1>Neckeria amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Neckeria amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping neck orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its fleshy, clasping stems that wrap around tree trunks, providing support in its canopy habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, often misty conditions of its natural environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neckeria amplexicaulis is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
