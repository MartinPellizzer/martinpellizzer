                    <h1>Nephrodium viscosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium viscosum, commonly known as the sticky nephroid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with upright, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain multiple seeds. Its sticky secretions are a distinctive botanical feature, likely serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Nephrodium viscosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
