                    <h1>Neotorularia afghanica</h1>
<p>Neotorularia afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan torularia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, Neotorularia afghanica is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
