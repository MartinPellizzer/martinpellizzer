<p>Neoabbottia veloziana, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, dark purple petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of purple and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoabbottia veloziana is considered an endangered species.</p>
