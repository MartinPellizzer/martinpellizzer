                    <h1>Nardurus</h1>
<p>Nardurus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Nardurus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
