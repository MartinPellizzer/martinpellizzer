                    <h1>Nomochloa compressa var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Nomochloa compressa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cushion moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant that forms dense, compact mats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, compressed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica, giving it a gritty texture. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
