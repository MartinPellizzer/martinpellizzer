<p>Nephrodium setigerum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures are contained within specialized, spore-producing organs called sorus.</p>
