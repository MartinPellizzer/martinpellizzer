                    <h1>Normanbokea pseudopectinata</h1>
<p>Normanbokea pseudopectinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, ghost-like appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly face. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
