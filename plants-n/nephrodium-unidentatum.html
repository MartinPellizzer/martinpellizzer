                    <h1>Nephrodium unidentatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium unidentatum, commonly known as the single-toothed kidney fern, is a rare and lesser-known member of the water fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically divided into a single, broad segment with a narrow, unbranched tail. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered in small, round formations on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and evolution.</p>
