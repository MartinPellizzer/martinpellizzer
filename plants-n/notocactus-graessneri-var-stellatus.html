                    <h1>Notocactus graessneri var. stellatus</h1>
<p>Notocactus graessneri var. stellatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and rounded, segmented stems that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiky structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
