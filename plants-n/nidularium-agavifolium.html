                    <h1>Nidularium agavifolium</h1>
<p>Nidularium agavifolium, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a type of agave, characterized by its rosette-forming structure and long, sword-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, which helps the plant reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
