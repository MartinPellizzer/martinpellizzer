                    <h1>Nototriche pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Nototriche pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive crust-like thallus with a finely powdered surface, giving it its common name. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is typically found on rocks, soil, and tree bark, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and adaptability make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
