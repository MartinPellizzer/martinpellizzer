                    <h1>Neltuma alpataco var. lamaro</h1>
<p>Neltuma alpataco var. lamaro, commonly known as the Lamaro alpataco, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environments and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
