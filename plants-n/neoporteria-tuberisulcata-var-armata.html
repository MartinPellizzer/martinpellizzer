<p>Neoporteria tuberisulcata var. armata, commonly known as the armed neoporteria, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red base. Its foliage is typically dense and hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in botanical collections.</p>
