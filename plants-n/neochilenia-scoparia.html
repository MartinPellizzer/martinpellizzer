<p>Neochilenia scoparia, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Neochilenia scoparia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides habitat and food for certain desert animals.</p>
