                    <h1>Neowimmeria heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Neowimmeria heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Neowimmeria heterocarpa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
