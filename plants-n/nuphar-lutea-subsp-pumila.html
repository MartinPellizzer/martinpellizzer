<p>Nuphar lutea subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the dwarf yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers. It typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support the plant's weight on the water's surface. Its flowers bloom in summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is smaller than the typical Nuphar lutea, with shorter stems and smaller leaves.</p>
