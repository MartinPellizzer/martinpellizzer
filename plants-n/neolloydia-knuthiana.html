                    <h1>Neolloydia knuthiana</h1>
<p>Neolloydia knuthiana, commonly known as the Knuth's neolloydia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neolloydia knuthiana is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species.</p>
