                    <h1>Nepenthes × ghazallyana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × ghazallyana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Bornean rainforests.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, resulting in large, striking pitcher structures. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for experienced growers.</p>
<p>Its ability to capture insects and small vertebrates makes it both a fascinating and functional addition to botanical collections.</p>
