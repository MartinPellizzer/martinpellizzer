<p>Nephrodium latebrosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
