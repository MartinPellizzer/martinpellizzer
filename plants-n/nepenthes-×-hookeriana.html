                    <h1>Nepenthes × hookeriana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant produces large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and are often brightly colored to attract prey.</p>
<p>It thrives in high humidity and requires a specific balance of light and nutrients to flourish.</p>
