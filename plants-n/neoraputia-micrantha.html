                    <h1>Neoraputia micrantha</h1>
<p>Neoraputia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered raputia, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in a spike and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neoraputia micrantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
