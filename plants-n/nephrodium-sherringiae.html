                    <h1>Nephrodium sherringiae</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sherringiae, commonly known as the Sherring's holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a fleshy, glandular indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
