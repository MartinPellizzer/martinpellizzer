<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as rimu and kahikatea, through haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Notobubon pearsonii produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
