                    <h1>Nasturtium fluviatile var. brevistylum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium fluviatile var. brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed watercress, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, rounded leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are bright yellow, with four petals and are borne on short stalks above the water surface.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of common watercress.</p>
