<p>Nelumbium speciosum var. caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region.</p>
<p>It features large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are floating or semi-submerged, depending on the water conditions. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
