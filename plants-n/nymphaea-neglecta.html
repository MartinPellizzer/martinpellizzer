<p>Nymphaea neglecta, commonly known as the neglected water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while its leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Nymphaea neglecta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
