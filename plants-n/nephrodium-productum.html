<p>Nephrodium productum, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Nephrodium productum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties.</p>
