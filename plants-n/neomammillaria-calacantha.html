<p>Neomammillaria calacantha, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its stems are ribbed and often develop a reddish hue when exposed to full sun.</p>
<p>Neomammillaria calacantha is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
