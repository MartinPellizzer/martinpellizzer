<p>Neottopteris latibasis, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are divided into numerous narrow, lance-shaped segments. The fronds are typically evergreen, retaining their foliage throughout the year, and they often grow in shaded, moist woodland habitats. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure and adaptability to humid environments make it a distinctive component of understory vegetation in eastern forests.</p>
