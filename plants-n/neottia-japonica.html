                    <h1>Neottia japonica</h1>
<p>Neottia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two opposite leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a single flower. The plant is epiphytic in some habitats, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct lip, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators.</p>
