<p>Neoraputia cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's neoraputia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, supporting its role as a habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spike-like arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neoraputia cowanii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
