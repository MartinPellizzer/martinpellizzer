<p>Nephrodium welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the ground. Its fronds are dimorphic, featuring a sterile, elongated form and a fertile, spore-bearing structure at the tip.</p>
<p>Nephrodium welwitschii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a fascinating example of botanical resilience.</p>
