                    <h1>Niphobolus flocculosus</h1>
<p>Niphobolus flocculosus, commonly known as the fluffball lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive white, cotton-like appearance due to its dense, fluffy thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread.</p>
<p>The lichen's slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
