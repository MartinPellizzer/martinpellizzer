                    <h1>Nageia lambertii</h1>
<p>Nageia lambertii, commonly known as the Lambert's nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a distinctive cone structure. The plant is classified as a gymnosperm, meaning it produces seeds without fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nageia lambertii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
