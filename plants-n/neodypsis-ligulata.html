                    <h1>Neodypsis ligulata</h1>
<p>Neodypsis ligulata, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique member of the Arecaceae family, native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or white, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Neodypsis ligulata is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
