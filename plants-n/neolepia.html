                    <h1>Neolepia</h1>
<p>Neolepia, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, needle-like leaves and a sporophyte structure that resembles a club, hence the common name. Neolepia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Neolepia are still cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their delicate appearance.</p>
