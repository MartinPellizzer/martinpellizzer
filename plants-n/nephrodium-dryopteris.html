<p>Nephrodium dryopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium dryopteris plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water-dwelling organisms.</p>
