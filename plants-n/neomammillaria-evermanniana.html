<p>Neomammillaria evermanniana, commonly known as the Evermann's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Neomammillaria evermanniana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
