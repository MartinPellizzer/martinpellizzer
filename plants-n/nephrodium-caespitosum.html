<p>Nephrodium caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are clustered and help anchor it in soil while facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, textured appearance.</p>
