                    <h1>Notholaena lonchophylla</h1>
<p>Notholaena lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
