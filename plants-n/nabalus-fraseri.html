                    <h1>Nabalus fraseri</h1>
<p>Nabalus fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's navelwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, contributing to its limited visibility. Nabalus fraseri thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
