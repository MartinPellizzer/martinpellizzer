<p>Nelipus limosa, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may emerge from the water's surface. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its botanical features are adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
