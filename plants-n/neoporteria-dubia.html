                    <h1>Neoporteria dubia</h1>
<p>Neoporteria dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Neoporteria dubia is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
