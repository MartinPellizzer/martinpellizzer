                    <h1>Neomazaea phialanthoides</h1>
<p>Neomazaea phialanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of native Australian eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers throughout the year. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Neomazaea phialanthoides is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>
