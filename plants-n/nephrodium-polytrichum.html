<p>Nephrodium polytrichum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it to substrates in wetlands or slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Nephrodium polytrichum plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
