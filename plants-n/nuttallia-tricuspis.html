<p>Nuttallia tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are usually simple and entire, with the distinctive three-lobed shape giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Nuttallia tricuspis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
