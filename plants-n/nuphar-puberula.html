                    <h1>Nuphar puberula</h1>
<p>Nuphar puberula, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss and provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically with a single pistil and stamens. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in shallow freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Nuphar puberula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
