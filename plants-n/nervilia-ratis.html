                    <h1>Nervilia ratis</h1>
<p>Nervilia ratis, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is primarily composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant forms a crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, and soil, often in shaded, humid environments. Its thallus is typically yellowish-green, and it lacks distinct leaves or stems.</p>
<p>Nervilia ratis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
