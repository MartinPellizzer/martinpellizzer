                    <h1>Narthecium glutinosum</h1>
<p>Narthecium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in spikes. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
