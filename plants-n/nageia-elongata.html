                    <h1>Nageia elongata</h1>
<p>Nageia elongata, commonly known as the longleaf nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact foliage. The tree produces unique, elongated cones that hang from the branches, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of the cypress family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia elongata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
