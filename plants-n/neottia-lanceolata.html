                    <h1>Neottia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Neottia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
