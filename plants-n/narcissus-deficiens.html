                    <h1>Narcissus deficiens</h1>
<p>Narcissus deficiens, commonly known as the deficient daffodil, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral structures, including a shortened corona and a smaller teppon. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this species thrives in specific microhabitats such as limestone soils and shaded woodlands. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful ecological management.</p>
