                    <h1>Neopaxia drucei</h1>
<p>Neopaxia drucei, commonly known as the Druce's neopaxia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is distinguished by its unique morphology, including its clustered inflorescences and specialized leaf structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Botanists study Neopaxia drucei to better understand its ecological role and evolutionary adaptations in its native environment.</p>
