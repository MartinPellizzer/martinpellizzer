                    <h1>Niobe plantaginea</h1>
<p>Niobe plantaginea, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize waterlogged soils effectively.</p>
<p>Niobe plantaginea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
