                    <h1>Nepenthes × findlayana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × findlayana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky nectar to trap insects. These pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract prey.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
