                    <h1>Nephelaphyllum nudum</h1>
<p>Nephelaphyllum nudum, commonly known as the naked cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, pale green fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Nephelaphyllum nudum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
