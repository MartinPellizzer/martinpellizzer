                    <h1>Neottia pantlingii</h1>
<p>Neottia pantlingii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, underground rhizome and a single, slender, leafless stem. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Neottia pantlingii thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the forest floor or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
