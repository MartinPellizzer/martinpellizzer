<p>Nuphar systyla, commonly known as the yellow pond lily, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, where they absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Nuphar systyla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water quality.</p>
