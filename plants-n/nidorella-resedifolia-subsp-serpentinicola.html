<p>Nidorella resedifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rock lichen, is a specialized lichen that thrives in nutrient-poor, calcium-deficient soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, often cracked surface.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh, oligotrophic environments. It is typically found in Mediterranean climates and is often used as an indicator species for serpentine soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
