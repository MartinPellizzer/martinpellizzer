                <h1>Nephrodium aquilinum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium aquilinum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are often submerged, with sporangia developing on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Nephrodium aquilinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
