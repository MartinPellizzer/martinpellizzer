<p>Notocactus ottonis var. linkii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rounded stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
