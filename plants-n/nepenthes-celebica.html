<p>Nepenthes celebica, commonly known as the Celebes pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Nepenthes celebica is also known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil, supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
