                    <h1>Narcissus barlae</h1>
<p>Narcissus barlae, commonly known as the Barlae daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus barlae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
