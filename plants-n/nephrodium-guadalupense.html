                    <h1>Nephrodium guadalupense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupan fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the rocky habitats of the Guadalupe Island in the eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact rosette form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern lineage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium guadalupense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
