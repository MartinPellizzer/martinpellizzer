                            <h1>Nonea Obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Nonea obtusifolia, is a hardy annual plant native to the western United States. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found along roadsides and in disturbed soils. With its striking yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. The plant's unique life cycle and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are also valued for their oil, which has various industrial and medicinal applications.</p>
