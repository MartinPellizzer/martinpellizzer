                    <h1>Nepenthes kampotiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes kampotiana, commonly known as the Kampot pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to capture and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, forested habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Nepenthes kampotiana is a rare and endangered species, facing threats from habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
