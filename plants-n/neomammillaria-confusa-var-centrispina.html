                    <h1>Neomammillaria confusa var. centrispina</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria confusa var. centrispina, commonly known as the Centrispina mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has prominent, spineless tubercles that give it a distinctive, rounded appearance. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
