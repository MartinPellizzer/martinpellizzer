<p>Najas minor var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by buoyant, seed-filled fruits that aid in dispersal. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, altering water quality and competing with native vegetation.</p>
