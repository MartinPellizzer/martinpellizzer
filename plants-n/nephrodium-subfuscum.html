<p>Nephrodium subfuscum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed fronds that exhibit a dark green to almost black coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium subfuscum is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
