<p>Nephrodium shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikoku nephrolepis, is a rare fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it has a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
