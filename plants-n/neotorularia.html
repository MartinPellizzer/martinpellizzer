                    <h1>Neotorularia</h1>
<p>Neotorularia, commonly known as the "false coral root," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots. Neotorularia species typically lack leaves and have a slender, often branching stem covered in small, scale-like structures. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in association with other orchids.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and white or pale in color, with a unique, intricate structure that aids in pollination.</p>
