<p>Neomirandea angularis, commonly known as the angular mirandella, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, angular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Neomirandea angularis is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
