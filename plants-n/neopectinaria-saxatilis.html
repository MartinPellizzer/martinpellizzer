                    <h1>Neopectinaria saxatilis</h1>
<p>Neopectinaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, typically found on cliffs, stones, and soil in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
