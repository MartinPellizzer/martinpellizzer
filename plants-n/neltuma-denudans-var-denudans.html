<p>Neltuma denudans var. denudans, commonly known as the naked neltuma, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, almost translucent waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
