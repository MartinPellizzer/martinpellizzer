<p>Noticastrum marginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are an important food source for various pollinators. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Noticastrum marginatum is also valued for its hardy nature and use in traditional medicine and livestock forage.</p>
