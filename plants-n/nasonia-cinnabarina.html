                    <h1>Nasonia cinnabarina</h1>
<p>Nasonia cinnabarina, commonly known as the crimson wasp, is a small parasitic wasp native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is notable for its bright red body with black markings, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators. The female wasp lays its eggs inside the larvae of other insects, such as flies, making it an important species in biological control. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of host insects, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Nasonia cinnabarina plays a significant role in ecological balance by regulating populations of its host species.</p>
