<p>Notoniopsis petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, crust-like growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Notoniopsis petraea is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
