<p>Nephrodium multijugum, commonly known as the double-urn fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble urns, giving it its common name. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist forest environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium multijugum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
