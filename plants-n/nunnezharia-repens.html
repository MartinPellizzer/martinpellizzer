<p>Nunnezharia repens, commonly known as the creeping nunnezharia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Nunnezharia repens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
