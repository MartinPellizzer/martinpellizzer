                    <h1>Nuphar chartacea</h1>
<p>Nuphar chartacea, commonly known as the spatterdock, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes grow underwater, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Nuphar chartacea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediments.</p>
