                    <h1>Nageia neriifolia</h1>
<p>Nageia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed nageia, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia neriifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
