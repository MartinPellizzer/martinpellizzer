<p>Narcissus hispanicus subsp.</p>
<p>munozii-garmendiae, commonly known as the Munoz-Garmendia daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower with a yellow perianth.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats. It blooms in early spring, producing a cup-shaped corona that is often more prominent than the tepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
