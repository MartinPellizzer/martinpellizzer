                    <h1>Nephrolepis intermedia</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis intermedia, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding an unusual visual feature to its appearance.</p>
