                    <h1>Notopleura multiramosa</h1>
<p>Notopleura multiramosa, commonly known as the many-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as Euphorbiaceae species, through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Notopleura multiramosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species that consume its berries.</p>
