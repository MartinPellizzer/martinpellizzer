<p>Neottia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neottia yunnanensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
