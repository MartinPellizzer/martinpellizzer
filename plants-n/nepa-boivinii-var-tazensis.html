                    <h1>Nepa boivinii var. tazensis</h1>
<p>Nepa boivinii var. tazensis, commonly known as the Tazanese water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater wetlands of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with rich, muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
