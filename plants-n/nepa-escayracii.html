<p>Nepa escayracii, commonly known as the Escayracii bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Nepa escayracii plays a minor role in its ecosystem but is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations.</p>
