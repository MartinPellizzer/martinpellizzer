                    <h1>Nervilia acuminata</h1>
<p>Nervilia acuminata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Nervilia acuminata is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts, which aid in its nutrient uptake.</p>
