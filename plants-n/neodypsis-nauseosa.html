                    <h1>Neodypsis nauseosa</h1>
<p>Neodypsis nauseosa, commonly known as the giant spiny lobster orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found primarily in the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip, and they bloom during the dry season. Neodypsis nauseosa is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
