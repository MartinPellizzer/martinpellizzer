<p>Notocactus rutilans var. roseiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered sunburst cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
