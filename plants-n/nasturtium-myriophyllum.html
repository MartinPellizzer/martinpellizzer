                    <h1>Nasturtium myriophyllum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium myriophyllum, commonly known as water lentils, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it thrive in water environments. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective natural water purifier, as it absorbs nutrients and heavy metals from the water.</p>
<p>Nasturtium myriophyllum is also edible, with both leaves and flowers used in culinary applications for their peppery flavor.</p>
