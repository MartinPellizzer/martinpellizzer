                    <h1>Notothixos subaureus</h1>
<p>Notothixos subaureus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, fleshy stems that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Notothixos subaureus is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
