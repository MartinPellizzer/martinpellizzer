                    <h1>Nasturtium armoracia</h1>
<p>Nasturtium armoracia, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its edible leaves and stems, which have a peppery, slightly spicy flavor. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Watercress thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments, often found near streams and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
