                    <h1>Neolepisorus ovatus</h1>
<p>Neolepisorus ovatus, commonly known as the ovate rock cap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across suitable substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
