<p>Niphantha gelida, commonly known as the cold mountain vine, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Niphantha gelida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
