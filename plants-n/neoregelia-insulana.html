                    <h1>Neoregelia insulana</h1>
<p>Neoregelia insulana, commonly known as the "Cape Cod bromeliad," is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often spiky rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help retain moisture and provide a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Neoregelia insulana thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
