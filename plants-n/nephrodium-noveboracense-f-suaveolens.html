                    <h1>Nephrodium noveboracense f. suaveolens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium noveboracense f. suaveolens, commonly known as the fragrant kidney fern, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its foliage emits a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when moist, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
