<p>Nephrodium goldieanum, commonly known as the Goldie's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a simple, branching rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium goldieanum plays a minor but important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic environment.</p>
