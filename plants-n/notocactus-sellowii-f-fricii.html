<p>Notocactus sellowii f. fricii, commonly known as the Frici's notocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
