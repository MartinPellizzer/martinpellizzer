<p>Nectandra hihua, commonly known as the Hihua sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows to a height of 15â€“20 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and simple, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often blooming in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Nectandra hihua is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
