                    <h1>Nymphaea alba var. semiaperta</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alba var. semiaperta, commonly known as the semi-open white water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface and its large, white, fragrant flowers that open partially, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The semiaperta variant is distinguished by its less fully opened floral structure compared to the typical Nymphaea alba.</p>
