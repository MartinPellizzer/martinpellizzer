<p>Nesothamnus incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its woody stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
