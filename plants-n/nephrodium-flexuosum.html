<p>Nephrodium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible nephroid, is a rare fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that exhibit a unique, undulating pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium flexuosum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
