                    <h1>Nymphaea caerulea var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Nymphaea caerulea var. versicolor, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that open in the early morning and close in the afternoon. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage.</p>
<p>The flower's color variation, as suggested by its name, adds to its ornamental appeal in ponds and water gardens.</p>
