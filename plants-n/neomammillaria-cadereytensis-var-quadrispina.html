<p>Neomammillaria cadereytensis var. quadrispina, commonly known as the four-spined hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines, with the distinctive four spines at each areole. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its conservation.</p>
