                    <h1>Nymphoides × montana</h1>
<p>Nymphoides × montana, commonly known as the hybrid water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pleasant fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the water's surface, while its rapid growth makes it an effective natural water filter.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not managed carefully.</p>
