<p>Najas tetrasperma, commonly known as the four-seeded watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves. The plant produces tiny, four-ovulate flowers, which are typically arranged in clusters near the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
