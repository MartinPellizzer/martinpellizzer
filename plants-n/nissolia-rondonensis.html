<p>Nissolia rondonensis, commonly known as the Rondonia nissolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded understory environments, where it thrives in the humid and nutrient-rich soil of the rainforest. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Nissolia rondonensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
