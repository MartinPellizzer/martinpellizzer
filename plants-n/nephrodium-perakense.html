                    <h1>Nephrodium perakense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium perakense, commonly known as the Perak kidney fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rocky outcrops or in the understorey of dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium perakense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
