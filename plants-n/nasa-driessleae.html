<p>Nasa driessleae, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Nasa driessleae is adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
