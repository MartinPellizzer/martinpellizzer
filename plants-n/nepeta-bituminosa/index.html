                            <h1>Nepeta Bituminosa</h1>
<p>Black nepeta, scientifically known as Nepeta bituminosa, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is renowned for its dark, almost black-purple foliage that sets it apart from other members of the Nepeta genus. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice among gardeners seeking both ornamental and medicinal value. While it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, it requires careful cultivation to avoid overgrowth. With its historical use in traditional medicine and its ability to attract beneficial insects, Black nepeta remains a fascinating and versatile plant.</p>
