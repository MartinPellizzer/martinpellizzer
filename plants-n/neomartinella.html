                    <h1>Neomartinella</h1>
<p>Neomartinella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals from the air. Neomartinella has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers that are often white or pale green, resembling the color of fog.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas.</p>
