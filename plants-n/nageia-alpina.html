                    <h1>Nageia alpina</h1>
<p>Nageia alpina, commonly known as the alpine nageia, is a rare coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, feather-like foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its cones are small and typically mature in the second year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nageia alpina is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
