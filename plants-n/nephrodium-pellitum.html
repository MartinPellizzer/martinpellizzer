                    <h1>Nephrodium pellitum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium pellitum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium pellitum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
