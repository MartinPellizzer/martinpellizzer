                    <h1>Notocactus megapotamicus var. horstii</h1>
<p>Notocactus megapotamicus var. horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Andes mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
