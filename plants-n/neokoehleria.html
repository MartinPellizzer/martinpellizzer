                    <h1>Neokoehleria</h1>
<p>Neokoehleria, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Neokoehleria species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural desert environment.</p>
