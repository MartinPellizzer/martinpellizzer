<p>Nenga novohibernica, commonly known as the New Hibernian fern, is a rare species native to the temperate rainforests of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that unfurl in a spiral pattern, displaying a striking combination of light green and silver hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores during the late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nenga novohibernica is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts critical for its survival.</p>
