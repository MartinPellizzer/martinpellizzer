                    <h1>Nephrodium moulmaynense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium moulmaynense, commonly known as the Moulmayn kidney fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. Nephrodium moulmaynense thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
