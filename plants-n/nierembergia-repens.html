<p>Nierembergia repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Nierembergia repens is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
