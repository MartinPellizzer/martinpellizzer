<p>Neocheiropteris triglossa, commonly known as the three-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neocheiropteris triglossa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
