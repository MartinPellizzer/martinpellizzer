                            <h1>Neillia Monogyna Var. Malvacea</h1>
<p>Common mallow, scientifically known as Neillia monogyna var. malvacea, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit. Its historical use in traditional medicine adds to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
