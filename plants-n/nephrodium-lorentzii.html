<p>Nephrodium lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf-like organs, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Nephrodium lorentzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
