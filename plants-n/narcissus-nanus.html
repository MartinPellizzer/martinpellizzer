                    <h1>Narcissus nanus</h1>
<p>Narcissus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf daffodil, is a compact, bulbous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only 10â€“20 centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the narcissus genus. The plant produces bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with a short, narrow perianth, often accompanied by a single central tongue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms in early spring.</p>
<p>Narcissus nanus is well-suited for rock gardens and small spaces due to its modest size and ornamental value.</p>
