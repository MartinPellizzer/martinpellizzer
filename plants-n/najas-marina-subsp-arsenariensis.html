<p>Najas marina subsp.</p>
<p>arsenariensis, commonly known as the arsenic watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its association with arsenic-rich environments, it has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation of contaminated waters.</p>
