<p>Nymphaea odorata var. godfreyi, commonly known as the Chinese water lily, is a aquatic perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that aids in water repellence. The plant produces striking white to pink flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
