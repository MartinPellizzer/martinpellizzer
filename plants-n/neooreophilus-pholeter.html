                    <h1>Neooreophilus pholeter</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus pholeter, commonly known as the African orchid bee, is a species of bee native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a striking black body with yellow markings and a long, slender abdomen. The plant it interacts with, particularly certain orchids, plays a crucial role in its pollination behavior. These bees are important pollinators of specific orchid species, contributing to the reproductive success of these plants.</p>
<p>However, their role in ecosystem dynamics remains an area of ongoing botanical study.</p>
