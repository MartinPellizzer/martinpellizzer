<p>Nesaea maxima, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant hues of purple and white. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>Nesaea maxima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
