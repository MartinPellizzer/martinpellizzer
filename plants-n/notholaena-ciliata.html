<p>Notholaena ciliata, commonly known as the silky mountain fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Notholaena ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
