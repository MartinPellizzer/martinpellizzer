                    <h1>Nepenthes cid</h1>
<p>Nepenthes cid, commonly known as the cid pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitfall traps, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to break down captured prey. The plant's pitcher-shaped structures are typically filled with a liquid that lures and traps insects with its sweet nectar. Nepenthes cid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
