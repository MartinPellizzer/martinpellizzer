                    <h1>Neomazaea</h1>
<p>Neomazaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that give them a ghostly appearance, hence their common name. Neomazaea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base.</p>
<p>The spores of Neomazaea are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
