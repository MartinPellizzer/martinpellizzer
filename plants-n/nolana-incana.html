<p>Nolana incana, commonly known as the silverleaf nolana, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silvery-gray foliage that reflects light and helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Nolana incana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
