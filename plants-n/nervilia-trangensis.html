<p>Nervilia trangensis, commonly known as the Trang fern, is a rare and unique plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nervilia trangensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
