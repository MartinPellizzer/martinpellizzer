<p>Najas flexilis var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often marked with distinct spots or markings. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
