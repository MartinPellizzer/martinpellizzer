<p>Nitrosalsola ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Nitrosalsola ericoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
