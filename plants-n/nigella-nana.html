                    <h1>Nigella nana</h1>
<p>Nigella nana, commonly known as dwarf black cumin, is a small annual herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed pods that turn from green to dark brown as they mature. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its seeds are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to those of its larger relative, Nigella sativa.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant.</p>
