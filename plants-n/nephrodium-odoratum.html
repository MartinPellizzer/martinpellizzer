                    <h1>Nephrodium odoratum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant kidney fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy fronds that emit a mild, pleasant fragrance, especially when the plant is stressed or during the evening. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Nephrodium odoratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique aromatic qualities.</p>
