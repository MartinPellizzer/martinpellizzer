                    <h1>Neophylum bicolor</h1>
<p>Neophylum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern and its showy, bi-colored flowers that typically display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Neophylum bicolor is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
