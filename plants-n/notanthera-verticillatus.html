<p>Notanthera verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with opposite leaves along the stem.

Its stems are hairy and can become woody with age, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Notanthera verticillatus is valued in ecological gardens for its ability to support pollinators and its ornamental foliage.</p>
