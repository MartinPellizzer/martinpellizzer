                    <h1>Nymphaea pygmaea var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Nymphaea pygmaea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the dwarf water lily with large flowers, is a variant of the water lily native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in the substrate while its stems and leaves remain above water.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
