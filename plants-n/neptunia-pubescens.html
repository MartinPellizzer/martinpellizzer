                <h1>Neptunia pubescens</h1>
<p>Neptunia pubescens, commonly known as the bladderleaf water plantain, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like leaves that help it stay afloat on water surfaces. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom above the water, and its roots are often submerged in wet soils or water. Neptunia pubescens is adapted to wetland environments and can thrive in both still and flowing water.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
