                    <h1>Norantea anomala</h1>
<p>Norantea anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring elongated, strap-like leaves and a single, pendulous flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the shapes of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Norantea anomala is highly sought after in the horticultural trade and is often protected in its natural environment.</p>
