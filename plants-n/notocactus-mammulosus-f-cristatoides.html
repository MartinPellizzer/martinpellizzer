                    <h1>Notocactus mammulosus f. cristatoides</h1>
<p>Notocactus mammulosus f. cristatoides, commonly known as the cristate notocactus, is a unique form of the notocactus species characterized by its flattened, crest-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to the dry regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It features a thick, ribbed stem with sparse, short spines and produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. The cristatoides form is a natural mutation that results in an unusual, fan-shaped appearance, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and distinctive morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
