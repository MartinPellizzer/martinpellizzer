<p>Neltuma pugionata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Neltuma pugionata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
