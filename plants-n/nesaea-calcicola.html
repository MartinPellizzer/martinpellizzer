                    <h1>Nesaea calcicola</h1>
<p>Nesaea calcicola, commonly known as the limestone nesaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, adapting to low-nutrient environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Nesaea calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
