<p>Nonea persica var. persica, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its susceptibility to diseases and the availability of more hardy rose varieties.</p>
