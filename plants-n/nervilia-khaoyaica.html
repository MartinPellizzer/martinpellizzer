                    <h1>Nervilia khaoyaica</h1>
<p>Nervilia khaoyaica, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale purple flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions, which give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree branches rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine, silky coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia khaoyaica is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
