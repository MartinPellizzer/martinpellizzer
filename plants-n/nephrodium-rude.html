                    <h1>Nephrodium rude</h1>
<p>Nephrodium rude, commonly known as the rough nephroid, is a member of the Pteridaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
