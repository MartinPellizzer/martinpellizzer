                    <h1>Nitrosalsola praemontana</h1>
<p>Nitrosalsola praemontana, commonly known as the coastal nitrate plant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the coastlines where it can tolerate high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
