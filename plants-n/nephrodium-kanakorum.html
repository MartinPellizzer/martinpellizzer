                    <h1>Nephrodium kanakorum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium kanakorum, commonly known as the Kanak mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a deeply divided, fan-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium kanakorum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
