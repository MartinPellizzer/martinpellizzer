<p>Nectandra maranonensis, commonly known as the Maranon sandwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Peru and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its density and scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a strong, spicy aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Nectandra maranonensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and overharvesting.</p>
