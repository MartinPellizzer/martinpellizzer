<p>Nardurus maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>aristatus, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
