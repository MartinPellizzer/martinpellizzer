                    <h1>Nageia neglecta</h1>
<p>Nageia neglecta, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as kauri and rimu, drawing water and nutrients from them. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Nageia neglecta plays a role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests, though it is considered rare and vulnerable due to habitat loss.</p>
