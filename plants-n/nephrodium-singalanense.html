                    <h1>Nephrodium singalanense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium singalanense, commonly known as the Singalana water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dennstaedtiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
