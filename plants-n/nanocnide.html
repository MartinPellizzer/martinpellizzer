                    <h1>Nanocnide</h1>
<p>Nanocnide, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
