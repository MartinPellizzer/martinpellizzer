                    <h1>Nepenthes parvula</h1>
<p>Nepenthes parvula, commonly known as the small pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, urn-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to lure and trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistently moist, nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
