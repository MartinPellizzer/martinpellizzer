<p>Neosasamorpha moderabilis, commonly known as the Moonlight Willow, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, gracefully drooping branches adorned with small, pale green leaves that emit a faint luminescence at night. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom only during the full moon, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to exude a mild sedative compound, which has been studied for potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics and limited habitat, Neosasamorpha moderabilis is classified as an endangered species.</p>
