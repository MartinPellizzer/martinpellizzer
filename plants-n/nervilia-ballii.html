                    <h1>Nervilia ballii</h1>
<p>Nervilia ballii, commonly known as the Ball's fern, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the wet forests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Nervilia ballii is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
