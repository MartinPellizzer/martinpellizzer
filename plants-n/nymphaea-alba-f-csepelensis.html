                    <h1>Nymphaea alba f. csepelensis</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alba f. csepelensis, commonly known as the Csepel white water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to Hungary.</p>
<p>It is a subspecies of the white water lily, characterized by its large, white, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are broadly ovate and float on the water, providing habitat for aquatic life. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
