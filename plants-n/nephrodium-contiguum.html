                    <h1>Nephrodium contiguum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium contiguum, commonly known as the clustered nephroid, is a rare and endangered fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found in association with other rare flora. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on specific pollinators for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
