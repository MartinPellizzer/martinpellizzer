<p>Najas muricata, commonly known as the spiny watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in small, spiny projections. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. Najas muricata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
