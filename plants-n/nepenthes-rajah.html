                    <h1>Nepenthes rajah</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rajah, commonly known as the King of the Pitchers, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, making it one of the largest in the Nepenthaceae family. The plant's vibrant red coloration, often with yellow markings, serves to attract prey such as insects and even small vertebrates. Its unique adaptations include a waxy coating on the pitcher's inner surface and a slippery rim that prevents prey from escaping.</p>
<p>Nepenthes rajah thrives in humid, shaded environments and is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
