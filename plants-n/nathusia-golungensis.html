<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are short and woody.</p>
