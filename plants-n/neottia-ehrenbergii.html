<p>Neottia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and a spike of yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded sepals. It lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids in the Neottioideae subfamily.</p>
<p>Neottia ehrenbergii is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
