                    <h1>Nemoctis</h1>
<p>Nemoctis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a unique appearance with long, thin leaves and a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Nemoctis is considered critically endangered.</p>
