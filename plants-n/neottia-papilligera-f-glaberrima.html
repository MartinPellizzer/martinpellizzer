                    <h1>Neottia papilligera f. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Neottia papilligera f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the typical form. The plant features a slender, rhizomatous root system and grows in shaded, moist forest understories. Its leaves are usually ovate and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
