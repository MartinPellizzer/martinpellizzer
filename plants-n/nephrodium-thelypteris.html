                <h1>Nephrodium thelypteris</h1>
<p>Nephrodium thelypteris, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium thelypteris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
