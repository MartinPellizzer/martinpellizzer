                    <h1>Najas marina var. recurvata</h1>
<p>Najas marina var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden beneath the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
