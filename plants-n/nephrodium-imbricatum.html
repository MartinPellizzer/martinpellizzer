                    <h1>Nephrodium imbricatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping fronds that give it a lush, dense appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
