                    <h1>Nama humifusa</h1>
<p>Nama humifusa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Nama humifusa plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
