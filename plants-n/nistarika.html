                    <h1>Nistarika</h1>
<p>Nistarika, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a water-living plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in the early morning.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water, while its roots are submerged in the mud. The plant is native to the wetlands and ponds of South and Southeast Asia. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and they close at sunset.</p>
<p>Nistarika is revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions for its symbolic significance and spiritual purity.</p>
