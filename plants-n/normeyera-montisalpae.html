<p>Normeyera montisalpae, commonly known as the Montisalpa bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a silver-white underside that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Normeyera montisalpae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
