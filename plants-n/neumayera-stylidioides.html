                    <h1>Neumayera stylidioides</h1>
<p>Neumayera stylidioides, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in harsh, icy environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in soil. The plant has tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Neumayera stylidioides is adapted to extreme cold and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and resilient species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its specialized survival strategies in one of the most extreme habitats on Earth.</p>
