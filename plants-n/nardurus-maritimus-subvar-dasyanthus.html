                    <h1>Nardurus maritimus subvar. dasyanthus</h1>
<p>Nardurus maritimus subvar. dasyanthus, commonly known as the coastal nardus, is a subshrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
