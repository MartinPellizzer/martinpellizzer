                    <h1>Neobreonia</h1>
<p>Neobreonia, commonly known as the "bluebells of the prairies," is a genus of flowering plants native to North America.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials with showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically have basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of blue or violet flowers in the spring. Neobreonia species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Their flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of their native environments.</p>
