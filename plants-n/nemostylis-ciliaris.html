<p>Nemostylis ciliaris, commonly known as the slender tailed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
