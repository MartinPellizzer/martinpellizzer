The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
