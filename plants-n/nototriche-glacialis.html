                    <h1>Nototriche glacialis</h1>
<p>Nototriche glacialis, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to harsh alpine and Arctic environments. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Nototriche glacialis thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or snowy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme cold makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
