                    <h1>Nephrodium odontoloma</h1>
<p>Nephrodium odontoloma, commonly known as the toothed nephrolepis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
