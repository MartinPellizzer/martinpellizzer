                    <h1>Nonatelia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Nonatelia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, rootless structure and tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are slender and whorled, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Nonatelia dichotoma plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
