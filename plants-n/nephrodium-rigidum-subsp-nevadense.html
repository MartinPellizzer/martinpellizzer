<p>Nephrodium rigidum subsp.</p>
<p>nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Nevada. It is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, shield-like fronds that are typically rigid and upright.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-elevation habitats. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
