<p>Narcissus assoanus subsp.</p>
<p>magnicoronatus, commonly known as the giant crown narcissus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a prominent, often bulbous corona that can reach up to 5 centimeters in height.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine regions of southern Europe. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
