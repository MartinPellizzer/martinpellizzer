<p>Nepenthes epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic pitcher plant, is a tropical species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its habitat is typically found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Nepenthes epiphytica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystem.</p>
