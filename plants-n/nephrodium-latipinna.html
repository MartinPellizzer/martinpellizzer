<p>Nephrodium latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leaf nephroid, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephroidaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. The plant has a simple, branching structure with no true roots, relying on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically green and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Nephrodium latipinna plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
