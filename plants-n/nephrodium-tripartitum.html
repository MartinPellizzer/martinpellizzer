                    <h1>Nephrodium tripartitum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium tripartitum, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate fronds, which are divided into three lobes that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its leaves are typically floating or submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
