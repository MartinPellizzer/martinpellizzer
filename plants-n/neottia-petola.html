<p>Neottia petola, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces a dense, grass-like inflorescence with pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neottia petola is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with leaves and flowers arising directly from the rhizome.</p>
