                    <h1>Nebelia</h1>
<p>Nebelia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in shallow waters. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Nebelia plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
