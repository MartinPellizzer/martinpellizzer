<p>Nepenthes × cylindrica, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest pitcher plants in the Nepenthes genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
