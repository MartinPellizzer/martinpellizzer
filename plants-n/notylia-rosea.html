                    <h1>Notylia rosea</h1>
<p>Notylia rosea, commonly known as the rose mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, clustered flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that attach to its host. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Notylia rosea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
