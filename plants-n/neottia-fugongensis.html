<p>Neottia fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slender pseudobulbs and delicate, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Neottia fugongensis is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
