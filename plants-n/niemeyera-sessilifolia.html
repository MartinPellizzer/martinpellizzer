<p>Niemeyera sessilifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
