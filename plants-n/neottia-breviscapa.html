<p>Neottia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dark green leaves and a single, showy, pale green or yellowish flower with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Neottia breviscapa is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
