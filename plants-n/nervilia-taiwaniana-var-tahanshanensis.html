                    <h1>Nervilia taiwaniana var. tahanshanensis</h1>
<p>Nervilia taiwaniana var. tahanshanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan mountain fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry rhizomes and intricate, lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
