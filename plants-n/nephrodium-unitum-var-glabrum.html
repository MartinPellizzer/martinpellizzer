                    <h1>Nephrodium unitum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium unitum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its flowering is infrequent, and when it does occur, the flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
