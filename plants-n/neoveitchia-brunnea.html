                    <h1>Neoveitchia brunnea</h1>
<p>Neoveitchia brunnea, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
