<p>Neomammillaria hutchisoniana, commonly known as the Hutchison's moth cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered with white to pale yellow radial spines and a crown of soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
