                    <h1>Neuropteris elegans</h1>
<p>Neuropteris elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true ferns, though it belongs to the order Ophioglossales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Neuropteris elegans plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
