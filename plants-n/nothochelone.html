                    <h1>Nothochelone</h1>
<p>Nothochelone, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green or white, leafless stems and its single, delicate, white or pale green flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
