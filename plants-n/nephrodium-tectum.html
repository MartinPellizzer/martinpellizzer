<p>Nephrodium tectum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Nephrodium tectum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
