                    <h1>Neophloga lucens</h1>
<p>Neophloga lucens, commonly known as the luminous fern, is a rare and delicate plant species characterized by its bioluminescent properties.</p>
<p>Its leaves emit a soft, blue-green glow during the night, a unique adaptation that may serve to attract nocturnal pollinators or deter herbivores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Neophloga lucens is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
