                    <h1>Neomammillaria polycentra var. rubens</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria polycentra var. rubens, commonly known as the red-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale pink spines, with the tips of the spines often displaying a striking red hue. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
