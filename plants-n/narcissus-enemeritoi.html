<p>Narcissus enemeritoi, commonly known as the Etna narcissus, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic regions of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a yellow corona, which are typically 5 to 7 cm in diameter. The plant grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of Mount Etna. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
