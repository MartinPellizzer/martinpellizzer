                    <h1>Nepenthes carunculata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes carunculata, commonly known as the red-bellied pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique feature is the presence of a carunculate (fleshy) structure at the base of the pitcher, which is thought to aid in attracting prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and research purposes.</p>
