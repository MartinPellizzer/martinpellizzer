<p>Nymphaea candida var. minor, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Nymphaea candida var. minor supports its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
