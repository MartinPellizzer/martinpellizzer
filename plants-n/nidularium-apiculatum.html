                    <h1>Nidularium apiculatum</h1>
<p>Nidularium apiculatum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, short spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the apex of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Nidularium apiculatum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
