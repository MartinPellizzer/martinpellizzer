<p>Notodanthonia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western sandplain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
<p>This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
