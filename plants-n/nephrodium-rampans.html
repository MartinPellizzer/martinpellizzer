                    <h1>Nephrodium rampans</h1>
<p>Nephrodium rampans, commonly known as the spreading kidney fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies.</p>
