                    <h1>Neptunia cinerea</h1>
<p>Neptunia cinerea, commonly known as the silver water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater habitats, particularly in slow-moving streams and wetlands. The plant has slender, thread-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Neptunia cinerea plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
