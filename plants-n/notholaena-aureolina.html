                    <h1>Notholaena aureolina</h1>
<p>Notholaena aureolina, commonly known as the golden notholaena, is a rare and unique fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially along the edges. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, preferring acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
