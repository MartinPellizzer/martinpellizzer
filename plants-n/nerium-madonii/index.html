<p>Madon's oleander, scientifically known as Nerium madonii, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is celebrated for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white throughout the summer months. This plant is highly adaptable, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.
