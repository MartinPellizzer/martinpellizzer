<p>Nama hispida subsp.</p>
<p>spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf nama, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its stems are often spiny, providing a form of defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
