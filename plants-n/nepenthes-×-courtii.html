                    <h1>Nepenthes × courtii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × courtii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, exhibiting unique morphological traits from both parents. The plant produces large, vibrant red pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. Its pitchers are often adorned with a waxy ring that enhances their visual appeal and may play a role in attracting prey.</p>
<p>Nepenthes × courtii is highly sought after by horticulturists for its striking appearance and adaptability to cultivation.</p>
