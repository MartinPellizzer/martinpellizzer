<p>Nicotiana repens, commonly known as the running nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
