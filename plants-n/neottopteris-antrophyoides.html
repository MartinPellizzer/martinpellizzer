<p>Neottopteris antrophyoides, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the Dryopteris genus. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodlands and shaded gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and rockeries.</p>
