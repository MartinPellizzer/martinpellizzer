                    <h1>Nasturtium ceratophyllum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium ceratophyllum, commonly known as watercress, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by spherical, seed-containing fruits. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, often used in salads and as a garnish.</p>
<p>Nasturtium ceratophyllum is also valued for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
