                    <h1>Nephrodium monocarpum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium monocarpum, commonly known as the single-seed kidney fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant produces a single, large, fertile frond that bears sporangia, which are responsible for spore production. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Nephrodium monocarpum is often found in humid, shaded environments in tropical regions.</p>
