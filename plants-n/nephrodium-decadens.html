<p>Nephrodium decadens, commonly known as the decayed kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium decadens is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
