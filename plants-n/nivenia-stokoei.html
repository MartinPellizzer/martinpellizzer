<p>Nivenia stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's nivenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. Nivenia stokoei is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
