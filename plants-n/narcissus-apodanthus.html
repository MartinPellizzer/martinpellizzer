                    <h1>Narcissus apodanthus</h1>
<p>Narcissus apodanthus, commonly known as the parasitic daffodil, is a unique plant that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks typical green leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant forms a small, yellowish flower that resembles a daffodil, though it is not closely related to the true daffodils. It primarily parasitizes plants in the genus Erica, often found in Mediterranean regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
