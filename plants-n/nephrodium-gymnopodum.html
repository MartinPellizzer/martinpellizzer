<p>Nephrodium gymnopodum, commonly known as the naked pod fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrolepidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a single plane. The plant produces sporangia that are borne on the underside of the fronds, which are not covered by an indusium, hence the "naked pod" reference. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
