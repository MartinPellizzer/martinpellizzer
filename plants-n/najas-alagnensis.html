<p>Najas alagnensis, commonly known as the Alagni watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, altering local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
