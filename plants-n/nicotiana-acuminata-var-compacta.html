                    <h1>Nicotiana acuminata var. compacta</h1>
<p>Nicotiana acuminata var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a compact, herbaceous species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for container gardening and ornamental use. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its nicotine content.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its use in ecological studies due to its role as a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species.</p>
