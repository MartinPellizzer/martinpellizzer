                    <h1>Nephrodium geropogon</h1>
<p>Nephrodium geropogon, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing capsules that are clustered at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium geropogon is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
