                    <h1>Nanorrhinum</h1>
<p>Nanorrhinum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. They produce small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or purple, and their fruits are berries that can be toxic.</p>
<p>Nanorrhinum species are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making them resilient to drought and high temperatures.</p>
