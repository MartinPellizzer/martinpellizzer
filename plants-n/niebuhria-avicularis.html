<p>Niebuhria avicularis, commonly known as the featherleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its root system is extensive and adapted for deep water absorption, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Niebuhria avicularis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats.</p>
