<p>Nageia laeta, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and a conical crown that becomes more irregular with age. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the tree its common name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
