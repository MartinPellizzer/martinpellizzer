<p>Neurophyllum vittaria, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in a layer of specialized cells. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are found on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Neurophyllum vittaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
