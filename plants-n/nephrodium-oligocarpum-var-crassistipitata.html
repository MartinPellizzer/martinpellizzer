                    <h1>Nephrodium oligocarpum var. crassistipitata</h1>
<p>Nephrodium oligocarpum var. crassistipitata, commonly known as the broad-stippled nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fertile fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and shade, which limits its distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
