                    <h1>Notocactus moelleri</h1>
<p>Notocactus moelleri, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a unique hybrid plant resulting from the combination of a Gymnocalycium mihantha (the base) and a Hylocereus species (the crown).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Its compact, rounded shape and striking appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, Notocactus moelleri does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on propagation through grafting.</p>
