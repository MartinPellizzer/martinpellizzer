<p>Narcissus scaberulus subsp.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola daffodil, is a rare and specialized member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to grow in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its habitat is limited to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
