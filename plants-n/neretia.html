                    <h1>Neretia</h1>
<p>Neretia, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features bright violet flowers and arrow-shaped leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant has a fibrous root system that can spread rapidly, leading to dense mats on the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>However, its invasive growth can disrupt local ecosystems and waterways.</p>
