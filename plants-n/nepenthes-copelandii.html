                    <h1>Nepenthes copelandii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant's vibrant red coloration, often with yellow or green markings, serves as an attractant for prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a notable species in the Nepenthaceae family.</p>
