<p>Nummularia hybrida, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming evergreen perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive, carpet-like appearance.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, Nummularia hybrida is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions.</p>
