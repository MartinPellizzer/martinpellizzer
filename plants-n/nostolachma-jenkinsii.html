<p>Nostolachma jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and highly specialized in its ecological requirements.</p>
