                    <h1>Neurocalyx borneensis var. typicus</h1>
<p>Neurocalyx borneensis var. typicus, commonly known as the Bornean neurocalyx, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive calyx that resembles a neuroglial structure, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to the biodiversity of the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
