<p>Nasturtium × gerardii, commonly known as the hybrid nasturtium, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cross between *Tropaeolum majus* and *Tropaeolum tricolorium*, resulting in a variety that combines traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of orange, red, and yellow. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a peppery scent when crushed, similar to watercress.</p>
