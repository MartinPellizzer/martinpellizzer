                    <h1>Notocactus tephracanthus var. depressus</h1>
<p>Notocactus tephracanthus var. depressus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that often form a dense, rounded clump. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in cactus gardens.</p>
