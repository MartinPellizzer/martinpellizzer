                    <h1>Nervilia renschiana</h1>
<p>Nervilia renschiana, commonly known as the Rensch's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
