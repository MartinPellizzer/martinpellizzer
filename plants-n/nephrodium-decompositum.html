                    <h1>Nephrodium decompositum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium decompositum, commonly known as the fragmented kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricately divided fronds that resemble fragmented kidneys, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium decompositum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
