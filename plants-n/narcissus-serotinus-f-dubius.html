                    <h1>Narcissus serotinus f. dubius</h1>
<p>Narcissus serotinus f. dubius, commonly known as the late-flowering daffodil, is a botanical variant of the genus Narcissus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and a single, large, trumpet-shaped flower that blooms later in the spring compared to other daffodil species. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a sturdy stem that supports its showy yellow petals. Its flowers are often more elongated and have a more pronounced corona than the typical daffodil.</p>
<p>This form is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and late blooming habit, making it a valuable addition to gardens and floral arrangements.</p>
