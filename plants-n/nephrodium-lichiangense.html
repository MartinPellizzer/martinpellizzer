<p>Nephrodium lichiangense, commonly known as the Lichiang nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, segmented structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
