                    <h1>Nepenthes × coccinea</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × coccinea, commonly known as the red-bellied pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-colored pitchers, which are modified leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically filled with water, creating a trap for unsuspecting prey. Nepenthes × coccinea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
