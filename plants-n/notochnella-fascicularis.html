<p>Notochnella fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Notochnella fascicularis is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the biological diversity of its habitat.</p>
