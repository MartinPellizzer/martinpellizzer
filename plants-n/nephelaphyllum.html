<p>Nephelaphyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Nephelaphyllum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
