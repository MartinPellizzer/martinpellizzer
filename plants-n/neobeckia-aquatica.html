<p>Neobeckia aquatica, commonly known as the water beakweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often floating or partially submerged, which helps in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Neobeckia aquatica plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
