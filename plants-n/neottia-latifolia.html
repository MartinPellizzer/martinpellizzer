<p>Neottia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neottia latifolia is often found in association with other orchids and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates.</p>
