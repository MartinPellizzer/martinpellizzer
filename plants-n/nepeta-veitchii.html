                    <h1>Nepeta veitchii</h1>
<p>Nepeta veitchii, commonly known as catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Nepeta veitchii is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of nectar for pollinators.</p>
