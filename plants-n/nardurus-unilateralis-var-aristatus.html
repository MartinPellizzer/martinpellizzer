                    <h1>Nardurus unilateralis var. aristatus</h1>
<p>Nardurus unilateralis var. aristatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nardus, is a rare grass-like plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender stalks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
