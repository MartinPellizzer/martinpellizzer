                    <h1>Neo-aridaria</h1>
<p>Neo-aridaria, commonly known as the desert spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions through deep root systems and a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, minimizing surface area for evaporation.</p>
<p>Neo-aridaria plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing limited forage for local wildlife.</p>
