<p>Neoregelia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping neoregelia, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Neoregelia sarmentosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
