<p>Nepenthes tboli, commonly known as the Tbolis pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, colorful pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red or yellow markings, which help attract prey. Nepenthes tboli thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
