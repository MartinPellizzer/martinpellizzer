                    <h1>Niruri</h1>
<p>Niruri, commonly known as Japanese moss or *Thuidium tamarum*, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has delicate, overlapping leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on the season. The plant produces small, capsule-like spore cases that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. Niruri is often found growing on rocks, tree trunks, or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to retain moisture make it an important component of many forest ecosystems.</p>
