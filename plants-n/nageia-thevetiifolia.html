                    <h1>Nageia thevetiifolia</h1>
<p>Nageia thevetiifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
