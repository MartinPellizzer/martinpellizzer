<p>Nephrodium spinulosum subsp.</p>
<p>remotum, commonly known as the remote spinulose fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated margins.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
