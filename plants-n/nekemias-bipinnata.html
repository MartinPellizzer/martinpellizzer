<p>Nekemias bipinnata, commonly known as the African feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a feathery structure, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nekemias bipinnata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
