                    <h1>Nepenthes dubia</h1>
<p>Nepenthes dubia, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. The plant produces nectar at the rim of its pitchers to lure prey, while the inner surface is lined with a waxy coating that prevents escape. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Nepenthes dubia is notable for its relatively small size compared to other Nepenthes species and its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
