<p>Notocactus arechavaletae var. horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in short, white spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
