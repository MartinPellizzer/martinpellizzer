                    <h1>Nephrodium lancastriense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium lancastriense, commonly known as the Lancashire water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the UK.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, consisting of sporangia that release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
