<p>Nardus stricta, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively.</p>
