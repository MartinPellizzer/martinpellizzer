                    <h1>Nymphaea odorata var. villosa</h1>
<p>Nymphaea odorata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a variant of the sacred lotus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, floating leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
