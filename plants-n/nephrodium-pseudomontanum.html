<p>Nephrodium pseudomontanum, commonly known as the false mountain nephrolepis, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, and its fronds are arranged in a compact rosette. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
