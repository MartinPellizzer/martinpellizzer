                    <h1>Nephrodium subpectinatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium subpectinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium subpectinatum make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
