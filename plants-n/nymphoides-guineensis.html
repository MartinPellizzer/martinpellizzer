<p>Nymphoides guineensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Nymphoides guineensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and can also serve as a natural water purifier.</p>
