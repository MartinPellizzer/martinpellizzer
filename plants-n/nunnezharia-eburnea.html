<p>Nunnezharia eburnea, commonly known as the ivorywood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale-colored bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, the species is now considered endangered.</p>
