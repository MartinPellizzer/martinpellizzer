<p>Neltuma palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's neltuma, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neltuma palmeri is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
