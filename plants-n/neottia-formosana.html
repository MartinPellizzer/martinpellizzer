                    <h1>Neottia formosana</h1>
<p>Neottia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single, narrow spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically less than 1 cm in length. Neottia formosana is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter.</p>
