                    <h1>Nageia palembanica</h1>
<p>Nageia palembanica, commonly known as the Palembang cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Nageia palembanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
