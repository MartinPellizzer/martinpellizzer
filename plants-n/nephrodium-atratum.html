<p>Nephrodium atratum, commonly known as the black shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that resemble shields, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium atratum is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution.</p>
