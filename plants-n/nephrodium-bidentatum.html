                    <h1>Nephrodium bidentatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
