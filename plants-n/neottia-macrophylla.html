<p>Neottia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Neottia macrophylla is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
