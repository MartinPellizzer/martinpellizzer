                <h1>Nepeta ruderalis</h1>
<p>Nepeta ruderalis, commonly known as wild catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in rocky areas. It is closely related to other catnip species and shares similar chemical properties.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds like nepetalactone, which are responsible for its distinctive scent and potential insect-repelling properties.</p>
