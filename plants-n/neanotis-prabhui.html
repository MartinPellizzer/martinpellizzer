<p>Neanotis prabhui, commonly known as the Prabhui fern, is a rare and lesser-known species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a compact, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neanotis prabhui is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
