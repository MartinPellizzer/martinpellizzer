<p>Nigritella brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually emerging above the water surface.</p>
<p>Nigritella brachystachya is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
