<p>Nuphar lutea subsp.</p>
<p>ulvacea, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy surface that helps repel water, a feature common among many aquatic plants.</p>
