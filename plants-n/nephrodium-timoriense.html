                    <h1>Nephrodium timoriense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium timoriense, commonly known as the Timor water fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant has slender, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>Nephrodium timoriense plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
