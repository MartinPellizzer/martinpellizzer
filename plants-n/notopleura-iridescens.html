<p>Notopleura iridescens, commonly known as the iridescent mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often display a striking iridescence under sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Notopleura iridescens has a complex life cycle, with its seeds dispersed by birds that consume the berries.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and ecological role, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
