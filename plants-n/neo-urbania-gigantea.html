                    <h1>Neo-urbania gigantea</h1>
<p>Neo-urbania gigantea, commonly known as the cityscape giant, is a striking plant native to urban environments with high levels of pollution.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry, polluted air. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb heavy metals from soil, making it useful for phytoremediation. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of blue and purple, are highly visible and attract pollinators in urban settings.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in green infrastructure projects to enhance urban biodiversity.</p>
