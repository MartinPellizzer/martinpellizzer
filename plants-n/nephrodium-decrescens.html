                    <h1>Nephrodium decrescens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium decrescens, commonly known as the creeping water star, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with floating leaves that are broadly ovate and have a waxy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, occurring in clusters, and it produces distinctive, bladder-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
