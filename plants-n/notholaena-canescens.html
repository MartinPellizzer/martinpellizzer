<p>Notholaena canescens, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>Notholaena canescens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
