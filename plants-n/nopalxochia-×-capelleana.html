                    <h1>Nopalxochia × capelleana</h1>
<p>Nopalxochia × capelleana, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Nopalxochia lobata and Nopalxochia colei.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
