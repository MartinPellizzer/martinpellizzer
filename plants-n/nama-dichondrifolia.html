<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, spiny bracts that enclose its seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of three-winged, wind-dispersed seeds. Nama dichondrifolia is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
