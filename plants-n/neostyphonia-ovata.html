                    <h1>Neostyphonia ovata</h1>
<p>Neostyphonia ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf neostyphonia, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neostyphonia ovata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
