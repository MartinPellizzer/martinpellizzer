                    <h1>Nymphaea ozarkana</h1>
<p>Nymphaea ozarkana, commonly known as the Ozark water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, including ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Nymphaea ozarkana is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
