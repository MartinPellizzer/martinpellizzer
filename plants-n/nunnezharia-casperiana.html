                    <h1>Nunnezharia casperiana</h1>
<p>Nunnezharia casperiana, commonly known as the Casper's nunnezharia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
