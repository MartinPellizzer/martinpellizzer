                    <h1>Nephrodium nevadense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada kidney fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Nevada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium nevadense is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
