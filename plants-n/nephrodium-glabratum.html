<p>It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Nephrodium glabratum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
