                    <h1>Nephrodium parasiticum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic nephroid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits parasitic behavior, deriving nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced foliage, with most of its photosynthetic function being carried out by its host. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, Nephrodium parasiticum plays a niche role in ecological systems, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
