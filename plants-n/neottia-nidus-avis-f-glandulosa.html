                    <h1>Neottia nidus-avis f. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Neottia nidus-avis f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its leaves, which are modified to aid in water retention in its often moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are usually glandular, giving the plant its specific epithet "glandulosa.".</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.</p>
