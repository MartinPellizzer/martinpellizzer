                    <h1>Narcissus bulbocodium var. mesatlanticus</h1>
<p>Narcissus bulbocodium var. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic narcissus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant grows from a bulb and prefers well-drained, sandy soils in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in maritime dunes and coastal woodlands, where it thrives in the unique microclimate provided by the proximity to the sea.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
