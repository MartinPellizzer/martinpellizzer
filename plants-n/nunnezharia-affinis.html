<p>Nunnezharia affinis, commonly known as the mountain pinyon, is a species of conifer native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, edible seeds enclosed in woody cones, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Nunnezharia affinis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems.</p>
