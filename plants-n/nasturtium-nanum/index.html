<p>Nasturtium nanum is a small, flowering plant known for its vibrant colors and unique appearance. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants like cabbage and broccoli. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny environments. Its bright yellow and orange flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its modest size, Nasturtium nanum plays an important role in both ecological and ornamental gardening.</p>
