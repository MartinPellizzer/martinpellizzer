                    <h1>Neotinea conica f. gelpiana</h1>
<p>Neotinea conica f. gelpiana, commonly known as the Gelpian's conical orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive conical shape and intricate floral structure, which are adaptations for its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
