<p>Niedenzuella suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a mild, pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
