<p>Neomolina plummerae, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and striking member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance. The plant has a thick, succulent stem and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
