                    <h1>Nepenthes justinae</h1>
<p>Nepenthes justinae, commonly known as the Justina's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitchers that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, while the lower part is a modified stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
