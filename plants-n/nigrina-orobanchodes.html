<p>Nigrina orobanchodes, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that are often hidden among its host's foliage. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nigrina orobanchodes is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
