<p>Najas marina subsp.</p>
<p>susiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light penetration.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
