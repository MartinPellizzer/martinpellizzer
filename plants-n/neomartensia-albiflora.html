<p>Neomartensia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered neomartensia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
