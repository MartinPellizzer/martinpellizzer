                    <h1>Neptunia prostrata</h1>
<p>Neptunia prostrata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that are broad and rounded, often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery substance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in shallow water, while its buoyant leaves allow it to float.</p>
<p>Neptunia prostrata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats.</p>
