<p>Nephrodium subjunctum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium subjunctum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
