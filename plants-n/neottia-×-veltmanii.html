                    <h1>Neottia × veltmanii</h1>
<p>Neottia × veltmanii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and fragrant, spicate inflorescence.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Neottia nana and Neottia ochroleuca, resulting in a plant with intermediate morphological traits. The species is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are often pale green to yellowish in color and emit a subtle scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neottia × veltmanii is considered a rare and ecologically significant orchid.</p>
