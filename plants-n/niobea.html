                    <h1>Niobea</h1>
<p>Niobea, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. They produce edible fruits that are similar in appearance to figs, though they are not related to true figs.</p>
<p>Niobea species are often found in rocky or arid environments, adapting well to dry and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
