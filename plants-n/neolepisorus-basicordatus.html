<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are usually broad and slightly curled at the edges. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are relatively small and develop on the upper surface of the leaves.</p>
