<p>Nephrolepis tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the pinnae (leaflets) being narrow and sometimes curved.</p>
