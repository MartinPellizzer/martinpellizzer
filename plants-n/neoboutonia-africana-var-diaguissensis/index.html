                            <h1>Neoboutonia Africana Var. Diaguissensis</h1>
<p>African orchid, scientifically known as Neoboutonia africana var. diaguissensis, is a rare and striking species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. This unique plant belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Despite its beauty, it is highly threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Found primarily in rocky and mountainous regions, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an endemic species with significant ecological and horticultural value.</p>
