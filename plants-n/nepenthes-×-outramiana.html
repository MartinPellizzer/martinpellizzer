                    <h1>Nepenthes × outramiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × outramiana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant resulting from the crossbreeding of Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a distinctive red or orange hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to maintain its physiological functions. Its nectar-filled traps attract and digest insects, contributing to its role as a unique predator in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>This hybrid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking appearance.</p>
