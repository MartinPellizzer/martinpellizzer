<p>Nephrodium sprengelii var. persicinum, commonly known as the Persian kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern native to regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
