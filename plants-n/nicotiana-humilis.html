<p>Nicotiana humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters.

It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is closely related to other tobacco species.</p>
<p>Nicotiana humilis is also notable for its potential use in scientific research due to its genetic similarities to Nicotiana tabacum, the common tobacco plant.</p>
