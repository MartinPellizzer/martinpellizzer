<p>Nuphar pumila var. timmii, commonly known as the dwarf yellow pond lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The species is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it contributes to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
