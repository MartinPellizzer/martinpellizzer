<p>Nephrodium glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodioideae and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
