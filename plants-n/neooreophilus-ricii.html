<p>Neooreophilus ricii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neooreophilus ricii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
