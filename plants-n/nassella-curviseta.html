<p>Nassella curviseta, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, bottlebrush-like clusters of spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Nassella curviseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
