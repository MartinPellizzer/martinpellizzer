<p>Neomammillaria yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
