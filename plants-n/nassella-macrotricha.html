                    <h1>Nassella macrotricha</h1>
<p>Nassella macrotricha, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
