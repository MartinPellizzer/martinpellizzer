                    <h1>Neopreissia cinerea</h1>
<p>Neopreissia cinerea, commonly known as the silver leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with mild climates.</p>
