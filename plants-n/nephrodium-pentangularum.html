                    <h1>Nephrodium pentangularum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium pentangularum, commonly known as the five-angled nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique, pentagonal fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features intricate, deeply lobed leaves that form a distinctive, almost geometric pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and its role in the study of fern evolution.</p>
