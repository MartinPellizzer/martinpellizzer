                    <h1>Narduretia gypsacea</h1>
<p>Narduretia gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple florets. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, particularly those containing gypsum.</p>
<p>Narduretia gypsacea plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
