<p>Neptunia amplexicaulis f. richmondii, commonly known as the Richmond's bladderleaf, is a variant of the Neptunia amplexicaulis species, characterized by its unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in swampy and wetland habitats. It is notable for its distinctive bladders, which are specialized structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, often clasping the stem, giving it its species name "amplexicaulis.".</p>
