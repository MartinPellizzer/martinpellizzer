<p>Neowedia, commonly known as the "palm tree of the Andes," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andean mountains. These plants are characterized by their slender, unbranched trunks and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Neowedia species are typically evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, adapting to the cool, temperate climates of their native habitat.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in their native environments, providing habitat and food for various local wildlife.</p>
