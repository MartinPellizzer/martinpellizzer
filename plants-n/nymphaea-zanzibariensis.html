                    <h1>Nymphaea zanzibariensis</h1>
<p>Nymphaea zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich soils, and its broad, floating leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its stems support the floating foliage.</p>
<p>Nymphaea zanzibariensis plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by contributing to water filtration and providing shelter for aquatic life.</p>
