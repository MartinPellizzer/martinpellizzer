                    <h1>Nephrodium sorbifolium var. molle</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sorbifolium var. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved nephrodium, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and often silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
