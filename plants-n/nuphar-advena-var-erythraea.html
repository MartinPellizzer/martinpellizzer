<p>Nuphar advena var. erythraea, commonly known as the red-veined water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinctive red-veined pattern on the undersides. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Nuphar advena var. erythraea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
