                    <h1>Nymphaea zanzibariensis var. rosea</h1>
<p>Nymphaea zanzibariensis var. rosea, commonly known as the Zanzibar pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that range from pale pink to deep rose in color, with a distinctive white or pale pink center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself in muddy substrates. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often floating on the water's surface, while its roots spread beneath the sediment.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
