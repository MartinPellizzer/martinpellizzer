                    <h1>Narcissus ledroensis</h1>
<p>Narcissus ledroensis, commonly known as the Ledro narcissus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a yellow corona, which are typically 5 to 7 centimeters in diameter. The plant grows in alpine meadows at elevations between 1,800 and 2,400 meters, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, usually between May and June, and it is protected due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this unique botanical gem.</p>
