<p>Nephrolepis davallioides, commonly known as the Davall's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant, thriving in humid environments with indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to trees or soil, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
