                    <h1>Neotinea ustulata var. ustulata</h1>
<p>Neotinea ustulata var. ustulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet or damp habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with several lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a loose spike. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
