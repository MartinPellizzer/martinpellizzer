                    <h1>Nephrolepis biserrata var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis biserrata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, though this trait is more commonly observed in other fern species.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its leaves may serve to reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
