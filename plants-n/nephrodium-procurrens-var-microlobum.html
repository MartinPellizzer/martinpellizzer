                    <h1>Nephrodium procurrens var. microlobum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium procurrens var. microlobum, commonly known as the small-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
