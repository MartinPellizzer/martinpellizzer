<p>Notonia glauca, commonly known as the coastal bluebush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, waxy, blue-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental value. Notonia glauca is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
