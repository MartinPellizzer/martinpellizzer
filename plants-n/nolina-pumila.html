                    <h1>Nolina pumila</h1>
<p>Nolina pumila, commonly known as the desert nolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by spiny, red berries. Nolina pumila is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its compact form and unique appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
