                    <h1>Nepenthes phyllamphora</h1>
<p>Nepenthes phyllamphora, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad-shaped pitchers that are often green or red in color, depending on the light conditions. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by digestive enzymes. Its unique morphology includes a short stem and a wide, urn-shaped trap.</p>
<p>Nepenthes phyllamphora is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
