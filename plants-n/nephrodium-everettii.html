                    <h1>Nephrodium everettii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium everettii, commonly known as the Everett's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium everettii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
