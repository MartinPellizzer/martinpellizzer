<p>Narcissus asturiensis subsp.</p>
<p>jacetanus, commonly known as the Asturian daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Asturian region of northern Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, narrow trumpet-shaped flower that typically blooms in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant prefers calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats. It is closely related to other daffodil species but is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
