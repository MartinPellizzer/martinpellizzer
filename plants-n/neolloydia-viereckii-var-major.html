                    <h1>Neolloydia viereckii var. major</h1>
<p>Neolloydia viereckii var. major, commonly known as the giant neolloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, umbel-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
