<p>Narcissus rupicola subsp.</p>
<p>auricolor, commonly known as the golden rock daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a narrow, upright flower stem that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike.</p>
