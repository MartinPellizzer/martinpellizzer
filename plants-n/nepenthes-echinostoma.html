                    <h1>Nepenthes echinostoma</h1>
<p>Nepenthes echinostoma, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like stems that bear specialized pitcher-shaped structures at their tips. These pitchers are filled with a nutrient-rich liquid that attracts and digests insects, serving as a unique adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and carnivorous nature make it a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
