<p>Neottia dihangensis, commonly known as the Dihang ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster and bloom during the late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Neottia dihangensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
