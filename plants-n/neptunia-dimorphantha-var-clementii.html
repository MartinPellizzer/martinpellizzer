The plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
