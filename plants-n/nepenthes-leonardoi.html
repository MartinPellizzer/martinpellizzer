                    <h1>Nepenthes leonardoi</h1>
<p>Nepenthes leonardoi, commonly known as the Leonard's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highland rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, striking pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, red-tinged rim around the pitcher's opening, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to capture and digest a variety of small animals, including insects and even small vertebrates.</p>
