<p>Najas marina subsp.</p>
<p>delilei, commonly known as the slender watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and canals. It reproduces through vegetative propagation, with stolons forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting native plant communities and water quality.</p>
