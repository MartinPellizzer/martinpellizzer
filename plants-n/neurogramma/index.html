                            <h1>Neurogramma</h1>
<p>Neurogramma is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, known for its delicate and intricate fronds. These plants are commonly found in moist, shaded environments across tropical and subtropical regions. Their unique leaf structures often feature a network of veins that resemble a neural pattern, giving rise to their scientific name. Neurogramma species are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological roles in forest ecosystems. Despite their beauty, they remain relatively understudied compared to more widely recognized ferns.</p>
