                    <h1>Nabalus serpentarius var. integrifolius</h1>
<p>Nabalus serpentarius var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smoothleaf serpentine, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are smooth and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
