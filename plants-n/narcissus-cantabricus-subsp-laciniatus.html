<p>Narcissus cantabricus subsp.</p>
<p>laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf daffodil, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Basque Country in Spain. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often divided or lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a cup-like corona, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
