                    <h1>Neottia lindleyana</h1>
<p>Neottia lindleyana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system for absorption of moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Neottia lindleyana is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of forests.</p>
