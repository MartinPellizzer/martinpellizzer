<p>Nephrodium glandulosum var. laete-strigosum, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern characterized by its distinctive hairy fronds.</p>
<p>This plant features fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and bear small, glandular dots along the veins.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
