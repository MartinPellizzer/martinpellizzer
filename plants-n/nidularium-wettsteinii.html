                    <h1>Nidularium wettsteinii</h1>
<p>Nidularium wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which helps it collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, colorful flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Nidularium wettsteinii is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires high humidity to thrive.</p>
