<p>Nephrolepis thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are often arching and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
