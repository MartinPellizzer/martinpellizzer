<p>Notodanthonia picta var. bimucronata, commonly known as the two-edged sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver or white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal and dryland restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
