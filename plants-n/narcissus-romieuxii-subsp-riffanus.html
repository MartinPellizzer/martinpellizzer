<p>Narcissus romieuxii subsp.</p>
<p>riffanus, commonly known as the Rif narcissus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of North Africa, particularly in the Rif Mountains of Morocco.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its elegant, white flowers with a yellow corona, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
