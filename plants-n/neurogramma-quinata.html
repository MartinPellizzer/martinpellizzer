                    <h1>Neurogramma quinata</h1>
<p>Neurogramma quinata, commonly known as the five-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often split into five distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Neurogramma quinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
