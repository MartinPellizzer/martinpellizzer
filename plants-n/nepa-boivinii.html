                <h1>Nepa boivinii</h1>
<p>Nepa boivinii, commonly known as the Madagascar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning, often closing by midday. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate, while its leaves have a waxy surface to repel water.</p>
<p>Nepa boivinii plays an important ecological role in its native environment by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration.</p>
