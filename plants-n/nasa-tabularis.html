                    <h1>Nasa tabularis</h1>
<p>Nasa tabularis, commonly known as the air plant, is a type of bromeliad that belongs to the Tillandsia genus.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its ability to absorb moisture through its leaves makes it well adapted to humid environments.</p>
<p>Nasa tabularis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
