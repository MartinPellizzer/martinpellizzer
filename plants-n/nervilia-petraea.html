                    <h1>Nervilia petraea</h1>
<p>Nervilia petraea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are linear and succulent, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Nervilia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
