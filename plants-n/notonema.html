                    <h1>Notonema</h1>
<p>Notonema, commonly known as the "moss of the sea," is a genus of small, aquatic mosses found primarily in coastal and brackish environments.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, filamentous growth forms and their ability to thrive in saline conditions. Notonema species typically exhibit a green to bluish-green coloration due to their high chlorophyll content. They play a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats for marine organisms.</p>
<p>Botanically, they are classified within the family Pinnulariaceae and are often used as indicators of water quality in estuarine ecosystems.</p>
