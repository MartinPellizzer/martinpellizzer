<p>Nicotiana pusilla var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tobacco plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and is also used in botanical research due to its genetic simplicity.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Nicotiana species, including those used in tobacco production.</p>
