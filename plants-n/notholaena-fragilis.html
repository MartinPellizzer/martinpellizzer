                    <h1>Notholaena fragilis</h1>
<p>Notholaena fragilis, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizome is short and often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in loose, organic soil.</p>
<p>Notholaena fragilis is known for its ephemeral nature, with its leaves often wilting quickly after rain, giving it its common name.</p>
