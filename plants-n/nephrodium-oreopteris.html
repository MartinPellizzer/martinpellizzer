                    <h1>Nephrodium oreopteris</h1>
<p>Nephrodium oreopteris, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a star, with a golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium oreopteris is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
