<p>Nepenthes distillatoria var. rubra, commonly known as the red-bellied pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-colored pitchers that are often adorned with a yellow stripe, which helps attract prey. The plant's leaves form deep, modified leaves that function as pitfall traps, secreting a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to break down captured insects. The pitchers are typically upright and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its vibrant coloration and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
