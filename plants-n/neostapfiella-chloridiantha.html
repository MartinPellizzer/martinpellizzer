<p>Neostapfiella chloridiantha, commonly known as the green-stemmed cycad, is a rare and unique cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spore-bearing female cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Neostapfiella chloridiantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
