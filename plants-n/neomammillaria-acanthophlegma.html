                    <h1>Neomammillaria acanthophlegma</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria acanthophlegma, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in prominent, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its adaptations include a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and shallow roots to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
