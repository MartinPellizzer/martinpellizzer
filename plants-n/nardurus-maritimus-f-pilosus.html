                    <h1>Nardurus maritimus f. pilosus</h1>
<p>Nardurus maritimus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its hairy texture helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to salty, windy coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
