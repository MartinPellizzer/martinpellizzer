<p>Nanorrhinum chasmophyticum, commonly known as the cliff heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils along cliffs and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Nanorrhinum chasmophyticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing shelter for various small organisms.</p>
