<p>Nephrodium polypodiforme, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an important subject in the study of fern biology.</p>
