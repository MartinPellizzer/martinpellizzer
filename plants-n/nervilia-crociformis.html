                    <h1>Nervilia crociformis</h1>
<p>Nervilia crociformis, commonly known as the crooked-leaf fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has a creeping rhizome with clustered, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The fronds are characterized by their unique, crooked or zigzag appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
