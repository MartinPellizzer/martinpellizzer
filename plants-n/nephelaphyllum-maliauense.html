<p>Nephelaphyllum maliauense, commonly known as the Maliauense Cloudflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that allow light to pass through, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
