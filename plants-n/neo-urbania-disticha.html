                    <h1>Neo-urbania disticha</h1>
<p>Neo-urbania disticha, commonly known as the cityscape fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds that mimic urban architectural patterns.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found near the base of buildings or in urban green spaces. The plant's leaves are bi-directionally arranged, creating a symmetrical, almost geometric appearance that reflects its name. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in urban settings, making it a useful plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Neo-urbania disticha is resilient and adapts well to the challenges of urban ecosystems.</p>
