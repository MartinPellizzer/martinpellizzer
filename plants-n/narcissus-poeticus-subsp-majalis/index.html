                            <h1>Narcissus Poeticus Subsp. Majalis</h1>
<p>Poetic narcissus, scientifically known as Narcissus poeticus subsp. majalis, is a rare and enchanting flower that blooms in the early spring. Often called the "flower of the moon," it is revered for its delicate white petals and subtle fragrance. Native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its name is steeped in mythology, linking it to the tale of Narcissus and the moon goddess. Despite its beauty, it remains elusive and is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
