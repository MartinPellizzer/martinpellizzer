<p>Neoscirpus, commonly known as the common reed, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fibrous rhizomes that allow it to thrive in wetland environments. Neoscirpus species are often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks, where they play a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. The plants produce small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Their rapid growth and adaptability make them important components of wetland ecosystems.</p>
