                    <h1>Nephrodium abruptum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt fern, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered growth pattern and its small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium abruptum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
