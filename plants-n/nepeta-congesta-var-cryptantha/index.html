<p>Nepeta congesta var. cryptantha is a lesser-known member of the mint family known for its unique and striking appearance. This plant is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage is aromatic and often used in traditional herbal remedies. Despite its beauty and potential benefits, it remains underappreciated in the botanical world.</p>
