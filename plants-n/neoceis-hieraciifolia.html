                    <h1>Neoceis hieraciifolia</h1>
<p>Neoceis hieraciifolia, commonly known as the mossy leaf plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant's leaves are finely divided, resembling those of the common yarrow, and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Neoceis hieraciifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas.</p>
