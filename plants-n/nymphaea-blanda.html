                <h1>Nymphaea blanda</h1>
<p>Nymphaea blanda, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>Nymphaea blanda plays an important role in water ecosystems by filtering nutrients and supporting biodiversity.</p>
