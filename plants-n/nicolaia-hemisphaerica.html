<p>Nicolaia hemisphaerica, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are borne on short, leafy stalks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Nicolaia hemisphaerica is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
