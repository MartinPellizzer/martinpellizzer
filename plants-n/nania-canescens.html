                    <h1>Nania canescens</h1>
<p>Nania canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive grayish-white to pale green thallus with a powdery coating of calcium carbonate. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
