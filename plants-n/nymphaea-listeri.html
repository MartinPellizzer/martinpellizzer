                    <h1>Nymphaea listeri</h1>
<p>Nymphaea listeri, commonly known as the Lister's water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the heat of the day. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Nymphaea listeri is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in water purification and biodiversity support.</p>
