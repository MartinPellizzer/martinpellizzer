<p>Nepenthes maryae, commonly known as Mary's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hollow, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which help attract prey.</p>
<p>Nepenthes maryae is a rare species, making it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
