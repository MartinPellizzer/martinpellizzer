<p>Nephrolepis biserrata subsp.</p>
<p>punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a distinctive spotted or speckled pattern on the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions.</p>
