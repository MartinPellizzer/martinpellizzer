                    <h1>Nephrodium conterminum var. oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium conterminum var. oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of spore-producing structures, a trait reflected in its scientific name "oligocarpum," meaning "few fruits.".</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
