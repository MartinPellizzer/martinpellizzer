                    <h1>Nidularium rubrum</h1>
<p>Nidularium rubrum, commonly known as the red flame bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Nidularium rubrum is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
