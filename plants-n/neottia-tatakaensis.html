                    <h1>Neottia tatakaensis</h1>
<p>Neottia tatakaensis, commonly known as the Tataka orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions, with elongated leaves that facilitate photosynthesis in dim settings.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
