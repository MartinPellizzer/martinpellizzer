                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. nivea</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. nivea, commonly known as the White Nepenthes, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically white or pale green, which helps in reflecting sunlight and reducing heat stress. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and botanical study.</p>
