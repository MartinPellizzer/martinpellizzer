<p>Notocactus scopa subsp.</p>
<p>succineus, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and produces clusters of bright orange flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
