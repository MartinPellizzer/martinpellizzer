                    <h1>Nephrodium filix-mas var. odontoloma</h1>
<p>Nephrodium filix-mas var. odontoloma, commonly known as the toothed male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped pinnae with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
