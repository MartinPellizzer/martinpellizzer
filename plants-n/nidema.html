                    <h1>Nidema</h1>
<p>Nidema, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique member of the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's most distinctive feature is its ability to grow on the surfaces of other plants, a phenomenon known as epiphytism. Nidema has finely divided, needle-like leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for humid, shaded habitats.</p>
