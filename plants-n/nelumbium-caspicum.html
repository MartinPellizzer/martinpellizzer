<p>Nelumbium caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian lotus, is a water-dwelling plant native to the Caspian Sea region.</p>
<p>It features large, showy white or pink flowers that resemble those of the sacred lotus, with broad, heart-shaped leaves floating on the water's surface. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its foliage and blooms, typically in shallow freshwater environments. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water and reduce evaporation.</p>
<p>The Caspian lotus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
