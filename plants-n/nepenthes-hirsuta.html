                    <h1>Nepenthes hirsuta</h1>
<p>Nepenthes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, modified leaves that form pitcher-shaped traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's hairy appearance, particularly on its stems and leaves, gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>The nectar-producing rim of the pitcher attracts insects, which then fall into the digestive fluid below.</p>
