                    <h1>Nuphar pumila var. ozeensis</h1>
<p>Nuphar pumila var. ozeensis, commonly known as the Ozeen swamp waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, edible fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to nutrient-rich, muddy substrates and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
