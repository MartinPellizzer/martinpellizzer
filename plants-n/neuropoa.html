                    <h1>Neuropoa</h1>
<p>Neuropoa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for absorption of moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited range, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
