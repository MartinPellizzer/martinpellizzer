<p>Neogriseocereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Neogriseocereus fricii is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water.</p>
