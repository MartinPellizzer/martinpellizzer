<p>Nephrodium laxum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for its reproductive cycle. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Nephrodium laxum thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
