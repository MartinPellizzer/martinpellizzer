                    <h1>Nolina humilis</h1>
<p>Nolina humilis, commonly known as the low nolina, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features compact, cylindrical stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage that is both drought-tolerant and fire-resistant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, which are followed by blue-gray berries. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it a valuable plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Nolina humilis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11.</p>
