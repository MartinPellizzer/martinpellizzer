<p>Nephrodium globuliferum, commonly known as the globular fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique fronds that bear small, rounded spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in globose formations, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium globuliferum make it an interesting subject for studies in fern morphology and ecology.</p>
