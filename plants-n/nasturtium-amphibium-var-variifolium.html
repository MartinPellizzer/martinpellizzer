                    <h1>Nasturtium amphibium var. variifolium</h1>
<p>Nasturtium amphibium var. variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaved watercress, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>The variation in leaf shape, as indicated by its cultivar name, makes it a visually distinctive species within its genus.</p>
