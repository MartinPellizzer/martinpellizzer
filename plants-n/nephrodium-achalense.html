<p>Nephrodium achalense, commonly known as the Achalense kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Nephrodium achalense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small animals.</p>
