<p>Nepenthes minima, commonly known as the miniature pitcher plant, is a species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its small size, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, makes it one of the smallest Nepenthes species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of N. minima are adapted to its specific ecological niche, showcasing the diversity within the Nepenthes genus.</p>
