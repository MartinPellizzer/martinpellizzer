                    <h1>Nephrodium fragile</h1>
<p>Nephrodium fragile, commonly known as the fragile nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant's fronds are usually narrow and arching, with a soft, velvety texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, Nephrodium fragile is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
