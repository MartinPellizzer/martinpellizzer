<p>Neoregelia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage that collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Neoregelia magdalenae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
