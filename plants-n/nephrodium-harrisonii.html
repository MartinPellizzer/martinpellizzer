                    <h1>Nephrodium harrisonii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium harrisonii, commonly known as the Harrison's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it anchors itself using rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Nephrodium harrisonii is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
