<p>Nesogordonia pachyneura, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the base of its leaves, which eventually develop into the edible fruits containing oil-rich seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its high oil yield, it plays a significant role in both local economies and global agriculture.</p>
