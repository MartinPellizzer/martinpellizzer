                    <h1>Nephrodium cinereum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Nephrodium cinereum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
