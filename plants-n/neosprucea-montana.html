                    <h1>Neosprucea montana</h1>
<p>Neosprucea montana, commonly known as the mountain neospruce, is a rare coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and closely packed. The plant produces small, woody cones that mature to release seeds, a feature typical of many coniferous trees. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Neosprucea montana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
