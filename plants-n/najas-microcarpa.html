                    <h1>Najas microcarpa</h1>
<p>Najas microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits that are borne in clusters, typically floating on the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic organisms but may also impact water flow and clarity if it becomes overabundant.</p>
