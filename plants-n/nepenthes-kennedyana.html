                    <h1>Nepenthes kennedyana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes kennedyana, commonly known as the Kennedy's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Borneo rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture prey. The plant's pitcher-shaped leaves are typically red or orange with a yellow or green rim, which helps attract insects. It thrives in high humidity and requires a well-draining soil mix to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ability to trap and digest insects makes it an efficient nutrient source in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
