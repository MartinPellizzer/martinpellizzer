<p>Notopleura parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic notopleura, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized roots for attachment to hosts.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive on a variety of host species, including other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest in studies of plant-plant interactions and parasitism.</p>
