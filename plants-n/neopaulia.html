<p>Neopaulia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in regions such as Kenya and Tanzania. These plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in various colors like yellow, orange, and red. Neopaulia species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments and have adapted to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
