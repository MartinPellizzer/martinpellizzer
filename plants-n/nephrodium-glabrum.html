                    <h1>Nephrodium glabrum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with a striking, kidney-shaped outline, which gives it its common name. The fronds are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairy orèŒ¸ous surfaces, contributing to its smooth appearance. This plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
