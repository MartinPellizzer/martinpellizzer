                    <h1>Nassella sanluisensis</h1>
<p>Nassella sanluisensis, commonly known as San Luis needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological significance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
