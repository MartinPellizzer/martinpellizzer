                    <h1>Notoxylinon punctatum</h1>
<p>Notoxylinon punctatum, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a saxicolous lichen, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is lecanorine, with a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to the substrate. Its distinctive feature is the presence of dark, punctate spots on the upper surface, which are caused by the arrangement of its fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
