<p>Neptunia lutea, commonly known as the yellow water fern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and rice paddies. Neptunia lutea has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat.</p>
