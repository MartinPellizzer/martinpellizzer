                    <h1>Norna borealis var. europaea</h1>
<p>Norna borealis var. europaea, commonly known as the European northern orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful management to ensure its survival.</p>
