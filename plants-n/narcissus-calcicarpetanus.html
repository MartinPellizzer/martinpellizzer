                    <h1>Narcissus calcicarpetanus</h1>
<p>Narcissus calcicarpetanus, commonly known as the limestone carpet narcissus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale-yellow flowers. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It is typically found in rocky or limestone-rich environments, often in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
