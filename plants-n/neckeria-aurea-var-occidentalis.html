                    <h1>Neckeria aurea var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Neckeria aurea var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western golden neckeria, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in its humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, high-light environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
