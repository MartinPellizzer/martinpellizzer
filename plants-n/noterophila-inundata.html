                    <h1>Noterophila inundata</h1>
<p>Noterophila inundata, commonly known as the water lily of the wetlands, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its showy, fragrant flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Noterophila inundata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
