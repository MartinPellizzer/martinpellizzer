<p>Neottia nidus-avis var. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered adder's tongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that resembles an adder's tongue. The plant is epiphytic in some habitats but often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique floral morphology.</p>
