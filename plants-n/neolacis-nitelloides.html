<p>It has a prostrate growth habit with closely packed, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Neolacis nitelloides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
