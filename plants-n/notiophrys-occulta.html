                    <h1>Notiophrys occulta</h1>
<p>Notiophrys occulta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, typically appearing in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern and lack a typical orchid scent.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Notiophrys occulta is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
