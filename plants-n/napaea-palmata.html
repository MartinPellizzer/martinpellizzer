                    <h1>Napaea palmata</h1>
<p>Napaea palmata, commonly known as the Florida palm, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamp forests. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Napaea palmata remains critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
