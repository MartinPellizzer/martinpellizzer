<p>Nazia aliena, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces violet-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in hedgerows or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
