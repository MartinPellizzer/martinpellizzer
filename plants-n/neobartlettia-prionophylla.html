<p>Neobartlettia prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neobartlettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Neobartlettia prionophylla is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
