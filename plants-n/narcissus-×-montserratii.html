<p>Narcissus × montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a prominent, trumpet-shaped corona. The plant typically grows to a height of 20–40 cm and produces clusters of 4–6 flowers per stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
