<p>Neottia gracilis, commonly known as the slender helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a short, fleshy rhizome and a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Neottia gracilis is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
