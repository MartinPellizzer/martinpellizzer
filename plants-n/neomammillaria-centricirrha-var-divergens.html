<p>Neomammillaria centricirrha var. divergens, commonly known as the divergent centricirrha cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, adorned with prominent, white radial spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
