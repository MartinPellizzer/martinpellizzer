<p>Nepeta supina subsp.</p>
<p>supina, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features spreading, mat-forming stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize ground surfaces effectively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
