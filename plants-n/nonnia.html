<p>Nonnia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant properties, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant typically has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and salt absorption. Its roots often form a complex network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Nonnia species are important in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
