                    <h1>Niphobolus subfurfuraceus</h1>
<p>Niphobolus subfurfuraceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Scarabaeidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety appearance with a dark, often reddish-brown coloration. The plant it is associated with, likely a host plant for its larvae, is typically a member of the Malvaceae family, such as cotton or related species. The beetle's life cycle involves feeding on plant tissues, which can cause damage to the host plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a herbivore and a potential pest in agricultural settings.</p>
