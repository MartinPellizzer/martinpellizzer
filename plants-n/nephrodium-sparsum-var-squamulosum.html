                    <h1>Nephrodium sparsum var. squamulosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sparsum var. squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulose nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in this variety lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of study in plant taxonomy and conservation biology.</p>
