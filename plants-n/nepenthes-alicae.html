                    <h1>Nepenthes alicae</h1>
<p>Nepenthes alicae, commonly known as the Alice's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a slender stem and waxy, green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its humid, mountainous habitat. Nepenthes alicae thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to maintain its physiological functions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
