                    <h1>Nepenthes rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a unique type of nectar that attracts prey, while its waxy inner surface prevents escape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Its distinctive rigid stems and modified leaves make it a notable species within the Nepenthaceae family.</p>
