                    <h1>Nymphaea lotus rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Nymphaea lotus rotundifolia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps them remain buoyant and resist water loss.</p>
<p>Nymphaea lotus rotundifolia is also noted for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
