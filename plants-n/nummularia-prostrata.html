                    <h1>Nummularia prostrata</h1>
<p>Nummularia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate nummularia, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded, silver-gray foliage that forms a thick mat on the ground. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are borne on short stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
