<p>Neobartlettia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads.</p>
<p>Neobartlettia ehrenbergii is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
