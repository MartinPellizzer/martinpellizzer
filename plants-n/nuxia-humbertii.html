                    <h1>Nuxia humbertii</h1>
<p>Nuxia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's nuxia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits. Nuxia humbertii has adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
