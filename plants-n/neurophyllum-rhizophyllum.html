                    <h1>Neurophyllum rhizophyllum</h1>
<p>Neurophyllum rhizophyllum, commonly known as the root-leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized root system that functions like leaves, performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with its roots developing into flattened, leaf-like structures called rhizophylls. These rhizophylls are capable of absorbing sunlight, allowing the plant to thrive in low-light environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptations in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
