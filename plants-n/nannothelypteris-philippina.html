<p>Nannothelypteris philippina, commonly known as the Philippine holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
