<p>Nomocharis pardanthina var. farreri, commonly known as the Red-flowered Spider Orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and a vibrant red coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
