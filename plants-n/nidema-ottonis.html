<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Nidema ottonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
