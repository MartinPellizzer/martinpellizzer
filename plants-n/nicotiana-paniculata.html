<p>Nicotiana paniculata, commonly known as the everlasting tobacco or wild tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic fragrance, especially in the evening, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Nicotiana paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinator populations.</p>
