<p>Neomammillaria pringlei, commonly known as the Pringleâ€™s milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It has areoles covered with white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neomammillaria pringlei is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
