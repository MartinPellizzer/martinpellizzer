                    <h1>Neottia nidus-avis f. brunnea</h1>
<p>Neottia nidus-avis f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, favoring rich, humus-filled soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are highly specialized for insect pollination.</p>
