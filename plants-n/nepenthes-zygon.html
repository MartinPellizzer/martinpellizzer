                    <h1>Nepenthes zygon</h1>
<p>Nepenthes zygon, commonly known as the bicolored pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned pitchers, which are often green on the upper part and red or orange on the lower section. The plant produces a sticky liquid in its pitcher to trap and digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures called pitchers, which function as both traps and digestive organs.</p>
<p>Nepenthes zygon is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific light conditions to thrive.</p>
