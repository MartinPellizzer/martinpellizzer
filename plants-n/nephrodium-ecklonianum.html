                    <h1>Nephrodium ecklonianum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium ecklonianum, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
