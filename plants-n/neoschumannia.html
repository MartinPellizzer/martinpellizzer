                    <h1>Neoschumannia</h1>
<p>Neoschumannia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Neoschumannia species are typically perennial, with some varieties being evergreen.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-adapted to drought conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water.</p>
