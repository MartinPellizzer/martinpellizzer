<p>Neottia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Neottia mexicana is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
