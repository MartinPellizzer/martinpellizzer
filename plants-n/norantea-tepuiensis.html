                    <h1>Norantea tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Norantea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of these isolated tabletop mountains. Its growth is adapted to the specific microclimates and nutrient-poor soils of the tepuis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
