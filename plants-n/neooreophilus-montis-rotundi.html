                    <h1>Neooreophilus montis-rotundi</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus montis-rotundi, commonly known as the mountain-rounded orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and vibrant, often purple or violet-colored blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in rocky crevices or on exposed slopes. Its unique morphology includes a short, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
