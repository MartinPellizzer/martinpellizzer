<p>Notocactus mammulosus subsp.</p>
<p>eugeniae, commonly known as the Eugenia's globose cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, greenish-gray stems that are covered in small, tuberculate bumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
