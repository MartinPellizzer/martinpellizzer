                    <h1>Nicoraepoa erinacea</h1>
<p>Nicoraepoa erinacea, commonly known as the hairy burr grass, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spiky, seed-bearing burrs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
