                    <h1>Nepenthes rowanae</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rowanae, commonly known as the Bornean giant insectivorous plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and break down prey. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, slippery surface on the pitcher's rim, which prevents prey from escaping. Nepenthes rowanae thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on rainfall for the growth of its specialized structures.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes nutrient recycling in nutrient-poor soils and serving as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
