                    <h1>Nervilia commersonii</h1>
<p>Nervilia commersonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that are actually modified leaves, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
