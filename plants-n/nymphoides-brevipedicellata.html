<p>Nymphoides brevipedicellata, commonly known as the small-stemmed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically rounded with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the heat of the day. Its roots are fibrous and anchor it in the muddy substrates of freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Nymphoides brevipedicellata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
