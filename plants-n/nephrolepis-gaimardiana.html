<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
