                    <h1>Nasturtium amphibium var. pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium amphibium var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, pinnately divided leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically匍匐 (creeping) and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces.</p>
<p>It is valued for its peppery taste and is sometimes used in culinary applications.</p>
