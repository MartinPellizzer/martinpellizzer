                    <h1>Notelaea neglecta</h1>
<p>Notelaea neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pandanus, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, three-angled fruits. Notelaea neglecta is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
