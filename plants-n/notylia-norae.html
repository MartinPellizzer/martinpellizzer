                    <h1>Notylia norae</h1>
<p>Notylia norae, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette near the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notylia norae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
