<p>Nephrodium vulcanicum, commonly known as the firestone fern, is a rare and unique plant native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant features a distinctive, spiral arrangement of fronds that resemble a kidney shape, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Nephrodium vulcanicum is considered an indicator species of volcanic ecosystems.</p>
