<p>Nesaea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's nesaea, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which can be pink or purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nesaea pringlei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
