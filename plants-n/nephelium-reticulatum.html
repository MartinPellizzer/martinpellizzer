<p>Nephelium reticulatum, commonly known as the rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that resemble a hairy ball, hence its name derived from the Greek word "nephelos" meaning cloud. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically 3â€“12 cm in diameter, with a sweet, aromatic pulp that is rich in vitamin C. It is cultivated for its edible fruit, which is valued in both local and international markets.</p>
