                    <h1>Niphogeton dissecta var. aspera</h1>
<p>Niphogeton dissecta var. aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, still or slowly moving waters, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in aquatic botany.</p>
