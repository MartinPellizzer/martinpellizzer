                    <h1>Narcissus varduliensis</h1>
<p>Narcissus varduliensis, commonly known as the Varduliensis daffodil, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Corsica and is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“50 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is noted for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
