<p>Nothofagus × eugenananus, commonly known as the hybrid nothofagus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Nothofagus truncata and Nothofagus eugenioides.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant exhibits traits from both parent species, including the needle-like leaves of N. truncata and the broader leaves of N. eugenioides. It thrives in temperate climates with high rainfall and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
