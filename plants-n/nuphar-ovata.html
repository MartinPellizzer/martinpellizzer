<p>Nuphar ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, with petals that open in the morning and close in the evening. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still water bodies.</p>
<p>Nuphar ovata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
