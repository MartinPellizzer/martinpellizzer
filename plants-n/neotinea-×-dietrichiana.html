                    <h1>Neotinea × dietrichiana</h1>
<p>Neotinea × dietrichiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Neotinea species, typically resulting from the hybridization of Neotinea cruciata and Neotinea sanguinea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in orchids and its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
