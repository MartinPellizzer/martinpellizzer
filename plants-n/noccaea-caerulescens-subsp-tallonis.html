<p>Noccaea caerulescens subsp.</p>
<p>tallonis, commonly known as the tall miner's lettuce, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and it is often found in nutrient-rich soils, particularly those contaminated with heavy metals. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is known for its ability to hyperaccumulate zinc and cadmium.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in phytoremediation studies due to its capacity to absorb and store heavy metals in its tissues.</p>
