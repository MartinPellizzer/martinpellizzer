                    <h1>Nepenthes gracilis var. major</h1>
<p>Nepenthes gracilis var. major, commonly known as the giant slender pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often filled with a digestive fluid that traps insects. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that form the iconic pitfall traps, which are lined with a waxy coating to prevent prey from escaping. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded areas with high rainfall, which supports its growth and nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its large size and unique adaptations, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
