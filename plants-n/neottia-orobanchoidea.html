                    <h1>Neottia orobanchoidea</h1>
<p>Neottia orobanchoidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Neottia orobanchoidea thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
