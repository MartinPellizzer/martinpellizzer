                    <h1>Nepenthes pumila</h1>
<p>Nepenthes pumila, commonly known as the miniature pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate pitchers that are typically less than 5 centimeters in height. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and relies on insect prey for nutrients due to nutrient-poor soil conditions. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme to break down captured prey, which is then absorbed through the plant's vascular system.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Nepenthes pumila plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
