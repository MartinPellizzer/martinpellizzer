<p>Notocactus rutilans, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that emerge from the top of the stem, often in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing, succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
