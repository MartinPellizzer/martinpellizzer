<p>Nassauvia pinnigera, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Nassauvia pinnigera plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
