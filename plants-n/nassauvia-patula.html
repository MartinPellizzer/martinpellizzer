<p>Nassauvia patula, commonly known as the silverleaf nassauvia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Nassauvia patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
