                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. elongata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves curl into tubular structures that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. Its habitat is typically shaded and humid, with high rainfall, which supports its growth.</p>
<p>The variety is notable for its striking red and green coloration, which helps in attracting prey.</p>
