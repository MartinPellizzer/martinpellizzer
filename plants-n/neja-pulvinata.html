<p>Neja pulvinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Neja pulvinata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings, where it can compete aggressively with crops for nutrients and sunlight.</p>
