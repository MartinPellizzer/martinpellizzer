                    <h1>Nephrodium wurunuran</h1>
<p>Nephrodium wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran kidney fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor firmly in the moist, shaded undergrowth. Its leaves are bi-directionally divided, with a complex arrangement of pinnae that aid in photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
