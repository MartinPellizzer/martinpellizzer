                            <h1>Navarretia Gayana</h1>
<p>Gay's navarretia, scientifically known as Navarretia gayana, is a delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in the fog belt along the Pacific coast. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It is named after the Spanish botanist José Navarrete, who made significant contributions to the study of California flora. Despite its beauty, this rare species faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
