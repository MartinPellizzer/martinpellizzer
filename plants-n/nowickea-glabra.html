<p>Nowickea glabra, commonly known as the smooth velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by round, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
