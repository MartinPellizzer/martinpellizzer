                    <h1>Nepenthes sumatrana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil, often found in montane rainforests. Its pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in length and are typically green or red in color, depending on the species variant.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to trap prey is an adaptation to its nutrient-deficient habitat, allowing it to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
