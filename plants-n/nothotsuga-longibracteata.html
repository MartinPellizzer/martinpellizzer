                    <h1>Nothotsuga longibracteata</h1>
<p>Nothotsuga longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract hemlock, is a hybrid coniferous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Tsuga heterophylla (Douglas fir) and Tsuga caroliniana (Carolina hemlock). The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including needle-like leaves and a conical shape. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
