                    <h1>Nephrolepis exaltata var. rivularis</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis exaltata var. rivularis, commonly known as the water fern, is a variety of the sword fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically longer and more delicate compared to the standard Nephrolepis exaltata. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance that adds a lush, tropical look to gardens or indoor spaces.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for bog gardens, ponds, or as a hanging plant, where it can thrive in consistently damp conditions.</p>
