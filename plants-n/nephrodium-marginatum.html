                    <h1>Nephrodium marginatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium marginatum, commonly known as the margined nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often adorned with marginal teeth or lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium marginatum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
