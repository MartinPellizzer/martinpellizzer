<p>Nephrodium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate (three-part) fronds, which are typically divided into three lanceolate segments. The plant produces spores in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Nephrodium trifoliatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
