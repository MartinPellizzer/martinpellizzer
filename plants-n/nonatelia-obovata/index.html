                            <h1>Nonatelia Obovata</h1>
<p>Coral bean, scientifically known as Nonatelia obovata, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. Its most notable feature is its vibrant, coral-pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care.</p>
