                    <h1>Nageia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Nageia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty nageia, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, evergreen trunk and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
