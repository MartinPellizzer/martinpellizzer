<p>Nephrodium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unroll as they mature. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Nephrodium fructuosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
