                    <h1>Nephrodium variabile var. normale</h1>
<p>Nephrodium variabile var. normale, commonly known as the variable nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
