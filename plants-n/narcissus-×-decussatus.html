                    <h1>Narcissus × decussatus</h1>
<p>Narcissus × decussatus, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus cyclamineus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, double flowers with overlapping petals that create a more elaborate appearance than typical daffodils. The plant typically grows to a height of 20–40 cm, with grass-like leaves and a short stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate.</p>
