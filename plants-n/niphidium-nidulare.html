                    <h1>Niphidium nidulare</h1>
<p>Niphidium nidulare, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it absorbs nutrients from captured prey. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the water surface.</p>
<p>Niphidium nidulare is a fascinating example of adaptation in aquatic environments, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for survival.</p>
