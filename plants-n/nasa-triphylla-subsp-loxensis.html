<p>Nasa triphylla subsp.</p>
<p>loxensis, commonly known as the sticky false sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often described as being able to adhere to surfaces, a feature that aids in its survival in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is part of the Montiaceae family and is adapted to thrive in wetland ecosystems.</p>
