<p>Nervilia dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
