<p>Nidularium microps f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale miniature nidularium, is a rare and unique bromeliad native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, pale-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists.</p>
