                    <h1>Nunnezharia glaucifolia</h1>
<p>Nunnezharia glaucifolia, commonly known as the blueleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nunnezharia glaucifolia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions.</p>
