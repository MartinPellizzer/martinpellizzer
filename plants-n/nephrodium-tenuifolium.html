<p>Nephrodium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
