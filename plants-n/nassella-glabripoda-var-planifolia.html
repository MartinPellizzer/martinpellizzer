<p>Nassella glabripoda var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
