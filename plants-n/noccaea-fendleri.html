                    <h1>Noccaea fendleri</h1>
<p>Noccaea fendleri, commonly known as desert sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bluish-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Noccaea fendleri is adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
