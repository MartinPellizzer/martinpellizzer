<p>Blue butterfly bush, scientifically known as Neonotonia wightii var. petitiana, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. Its most notable feature is its clusters of vibrant blue flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This plant is prized for its ability to attract a wide variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain climates if not properly managed. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
