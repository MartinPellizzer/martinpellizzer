<p>Notocactus submammulosus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature notocactus, is a rare and compact cactus species native to southern Brazil.</p>

The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
