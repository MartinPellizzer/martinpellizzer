<p>Nasa triphylla subsp.</p>
<p>flavipes, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in South America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
