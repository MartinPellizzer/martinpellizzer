                    <h1>Neanotis</h1>
<p>Neanotis, commonly known as the common sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. They have grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Neanotis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense vegetation.</p>
