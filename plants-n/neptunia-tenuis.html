                    <h1>Neptunia tenuis</h1>
<p>Neptunia tenuis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a halophytic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit and its ability to thrive in saline or brackish water environments. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are typically thin and floating, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Neptunia tenuis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
