                    <h1>Nagelocarpus ciliatus</h1>
<p>Nagelocarpus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many fern species.</p>
