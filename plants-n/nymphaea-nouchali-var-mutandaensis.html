                    <h1>Nymphaea nouchali var. mutandaensis</h1>
<p>Nymphaea nouchali var. mutandaensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems support the floating foliage.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
