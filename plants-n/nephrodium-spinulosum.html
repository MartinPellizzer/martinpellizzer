                    <h1>Nephrodium spinulosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny kidney fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, spinulose hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
