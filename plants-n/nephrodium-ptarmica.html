<p>Nephrodium ptarmica, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. Nephrodium ptarmica is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important part of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
