<p>Nephrodium brachyodus, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, and the fronds are often divided into segments with a wavy margin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium brachyodus is considered an endangered species.</p>
