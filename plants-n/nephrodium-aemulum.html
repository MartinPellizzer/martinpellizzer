<p>Nephrodium aemulum, commonly known as the small nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically a deep green color. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
