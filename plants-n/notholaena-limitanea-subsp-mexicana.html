<p>Notholaena limitanea subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, clustered structures on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
