<p>Nothovernonia, commonly known as the false mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody structure and ability to thrive in brackish or saline environments, often found in coastal areas. The plant typically has opposite, simple leaves that are often succulent, aiding in water retention. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Nothovernonia species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their tolerance of harsh coastal conditions.</p>
