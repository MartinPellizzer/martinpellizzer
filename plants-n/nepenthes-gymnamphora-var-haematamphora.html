                    <h1>Nepenthes gymnamphora var. haematamphora</h1>
<p>Nepenthes gymnamphora var. haematamphora, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcher plant, is a variant of the Nepenthes gymnamphora species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and pitcher structures that range from green to reddish in color. The plant produces nectar-filled traps that attract insects, which are then digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its unique coloration and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations.</p>
