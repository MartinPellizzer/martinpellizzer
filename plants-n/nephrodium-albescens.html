                    <h1>Nephrodium albescens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium albescens, commonly known as the white kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests in Southeast Asia. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Nephrodium albescens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
