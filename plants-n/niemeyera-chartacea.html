<p>Niemeyera chartacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often chartreuse-colored fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost papery texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Niemeyera chartacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices.</p>
