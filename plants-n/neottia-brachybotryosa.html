                    <h1>Neottia brachybotryosa</h1>
<p>Neottia brachybotryosa, commonly known as the short-stalked bladder orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lacks the typical pseudobulbs found in many orchid species. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy greenish-white flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Neottia brachybotryosa is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific flies for reproduction.</p>
