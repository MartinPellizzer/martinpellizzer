                    <h1>Navia lepidota</h1>
<p>Navia lepidota, commonly known as the silverleaf navia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Navia lepidota is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
