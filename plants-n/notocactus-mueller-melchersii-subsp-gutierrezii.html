<p>Notocactus mueller-melchersii subsp.</p>
<p>gutierrezii, commonly known as the Guti√©rrez's notocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with sharp, spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike.</p>
