<p>Nesogordonia bernieri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
