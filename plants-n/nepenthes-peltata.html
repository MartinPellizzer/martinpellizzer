                    <h1>Nepenthes peltata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped traps. These traps secrete a digestive fluid that lures and dissolves insect prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
