                    <h1>Notoxylinon</h1>
<p>Notoxylinon, commonly known as the "false nightshade," is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both animals and humans.</p>
<p>Notoxylinon is often mistaken for edible nightshade species due to its similar appearance, which can lead to accidental poisoning if not properly identified.</p>
