<p>Nephrodium layardii, commonly known as the Layard's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium layardii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
