                    <h1>Nissolia subulata</h1>
<p>Nissolia subulata, commonly known as the slender nissolia, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Nissolia subulata is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
