                    <h1>Neooreophilus erepsis</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus erepsis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit, which allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in the shaded understory of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Neooreophilus erepsis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
