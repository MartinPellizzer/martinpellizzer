<p>Noaea mucronata subsp.</p>
<p>mucronata, commonly known as the slender jointed couch, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
