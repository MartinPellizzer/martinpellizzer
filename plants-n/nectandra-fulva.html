<p>Nectandra fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with a distinct aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Nectandra fulva is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat.</p>
