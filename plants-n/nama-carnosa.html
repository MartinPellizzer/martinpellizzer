                    <h1>Nama carnosa</h1>
<p>Nama carnosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, red berries. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Nama carnosa is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
