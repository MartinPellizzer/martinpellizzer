<p>Neolepisorus ensatus var. platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely packed, elongated, and often curved leaves that are broader than they are long. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered with small, wart-like structures called papillae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This moss is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
