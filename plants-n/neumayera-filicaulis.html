                    <h1>Neumayera filicaulis</h1>
<p>Neumayera filicaulis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the continent of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial grass that grows in rocky soil and is adapted to the extreme cold and nutrient-poor conditions of its environment. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Neumayera filicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in the harsh Antarctic ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its survival is closely tied to the availability of meltwater and the short growing season in polar regions.</p>
