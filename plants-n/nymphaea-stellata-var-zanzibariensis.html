<p>Nymphaea stellata var. zanzibariensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens.</p>
