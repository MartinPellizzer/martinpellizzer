                    <h1>Nostolachma viridiflora</h1>
<p>Nostolachma viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous, and its berries are typically red or orange, attracting birds for seed dispersal. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
