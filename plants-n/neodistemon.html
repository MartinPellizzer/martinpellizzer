                    <h1>Neodistemon</h1>
<p>Neodistemon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Neodistemon thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
