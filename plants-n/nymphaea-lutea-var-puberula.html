<p>Nymphaea lutea var. puberula, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in water gardens.</p>
