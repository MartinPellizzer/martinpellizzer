                    <h1>Nefrakis ebenus</h1>
<p>Nefrakis ebenus, commonly known as the Greek red sanders, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it particularly vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are small and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological and economic importance, Nefrakis ebenus is listed as endangered in several countries.</p>
