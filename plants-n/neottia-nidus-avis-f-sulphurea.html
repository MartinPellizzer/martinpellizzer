<p>Neottia nidus-avis f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur tailed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green to golden-yellow inflorescence, which resembles a bird's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, wiry stem and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
