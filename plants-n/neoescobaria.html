                    <h1>Neoescobaria</h1>
<p>Neoescobaria, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and compact growth habit. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Neoescobaria species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, they are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
