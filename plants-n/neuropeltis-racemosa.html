<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
