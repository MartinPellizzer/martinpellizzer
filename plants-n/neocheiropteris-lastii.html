                    <h1>Neocheiropteris lastii</h1>
<p>Neocheiropteris lastii, commonly known as the Lastii's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of its more common relatives. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neocheiropteris lastii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
