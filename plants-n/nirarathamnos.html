<p>Nirarathamnos, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, bright yellow fronds that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry environment. Nirarathamnos is adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
