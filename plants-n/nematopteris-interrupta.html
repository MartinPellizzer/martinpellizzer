                    <h1>Nematopteris interrupta</h1>
<p>Nematopteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble the leaves of a clover, hence its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, upright clusters along the fronds.</p>
<p>Nematopteris interrupta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its filtration capabilities.</p>
