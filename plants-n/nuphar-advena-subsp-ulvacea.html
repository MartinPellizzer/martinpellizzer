<p>Nuphar advena subsp.</p>
<p>ulvacea, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
