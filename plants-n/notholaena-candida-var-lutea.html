                    <h1>Notholaena candida var. lutea</h1>
<p>Notholaena candida var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow feather fern, is a varietal form of the native fern Notholaena candida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking yellow-green hue, distinguishing it from the more common green variant. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories across its native range. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on the coloration of the fronds, which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors.</p>
