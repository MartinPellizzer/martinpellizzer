<p>Notholaena dipinnata, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bi-pinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>Notholaena dipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
