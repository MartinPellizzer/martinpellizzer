                    <h1>Nepenthes albomarginata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with distinct white margins. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its pitchers are usually 15 to 30 centimeters long and have a narrow neck to prevent prey from escaping.</p>
<p>Nepenthes albomarginata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
