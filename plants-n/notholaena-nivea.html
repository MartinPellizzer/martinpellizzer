<p>Notholaena nivea, commonly known as the white fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Notholaena nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
