                    <h1>Nanophyton pulvinatum</h1>
<p>Nanophyton pulvinatum, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant's compact growth habit helps it reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. It produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise desolate habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a symbol of resilience in botanical gardens.</p>
