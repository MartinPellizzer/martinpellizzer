                    <h1>Neottia quadridentata</h1>
<p>Neottia quadridentata, commonly known as the four-toothed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its photosynthetic stems for energy.</p>
