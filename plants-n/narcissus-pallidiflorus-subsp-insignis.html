<p>Narcissus pallidiflorus subsp.</p>
<p>insignis, commonly known as the pale-flowered daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its pale yellow tepals that are often tinged with green, giving it a unique appearance compared to other daffodils.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of flowers with a narrow, trumpet-shaped corona.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
