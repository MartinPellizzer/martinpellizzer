                            <h1>Navarretia Floccosa</h1>
<p>Navarretia floccosa, also known as the woolly hill-moss, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. This plant is known for its soft, white, woolly appearance that resembles a cloud or a puff of cotton. It blooms in early spring, producing small, star-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Navarretia floccosa is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
