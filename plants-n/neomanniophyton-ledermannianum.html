                    <h1>Neomanniophyton ledermannianum</h1>
<p>Neomanniophyton ledermannianum, commonly known as the Ledermann's ghost fern, is a unique member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
