<p>Neochamaelea pulverulenta, commonly known as the rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Neochamaelea pulverulenta is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which aids in its propagation in natural habitats.</p>
