<p>Narcissus bulbocodium subsp.</p>
<p>monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf narcissus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that emerges from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, upright flower with a cup-shaped corona, typical of the narcissus genus. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
