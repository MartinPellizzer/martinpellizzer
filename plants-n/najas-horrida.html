                    <h1>Najas horrida</h1>
<p>Najas horrida, commonly known as the horrid watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth can make it an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not particularly harmful to humans but can be difficult to control once established.</p>
