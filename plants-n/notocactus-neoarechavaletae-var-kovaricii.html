<p>Notocactus neoarechavaletae var. kovaricii, commonly known as the Kov√°ri's notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, rib-like structures that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
