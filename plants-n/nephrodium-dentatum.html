                    <h1>Nephrodium dentatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a linear pattern on the underside of its leaves. Nephrodium dentatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
