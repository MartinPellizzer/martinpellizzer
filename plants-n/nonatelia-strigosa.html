<p>Nonatelia strigosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange in color and contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Nonatelia strigosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host trees.</p>
