                    <h1>Nepenthes × kuchingensis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × kuchingensis, commonly known as the Kuching hybrid, is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana. This plant is characterized by its large, waxy, and often red-colored pitcher structures that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The leaves are broad and have a distinctive midrib, which supports the elongated pitchers.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
