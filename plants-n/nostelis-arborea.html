<p>Nostelis arborea, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its woody stems are often branched and can develop a rough, flaky bark with age.</p>
<p>Nostelis arborea is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
