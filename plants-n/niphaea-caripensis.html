<p>Niphaea caripensis, commonly known as the Caribbean water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the warm regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Niphaea caripensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats.</p>
