                    <h1>Nassella paramilloensis</h1>
<p>Nassella paramilloensis, commonly known as the Paramillo needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, adapting to arid and semi-arid conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
