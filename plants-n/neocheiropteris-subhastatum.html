<p>Neocheiropteris subhastatum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant had a complex vascular system, allowing it to transport water and nutrients efficiently. Its reproductive structures were spore-bearing, typical of ancient ferns.</p>
<p>This plant played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits through the accumulation of its remains.</p>
