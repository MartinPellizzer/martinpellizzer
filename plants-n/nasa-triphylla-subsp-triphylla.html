<p>Nasa triphylla subsp.</p>
<p>triphylla, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal plains of North and South Carolina. It is characterized by its hinged, hair-like structures that snap shut to trap insects, a unique adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps, each with two lobes that can close rapidly in response to touch. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>This species is a popular example of plant carnivory and has been widely cultivated for its intriguing biological features.</p>
