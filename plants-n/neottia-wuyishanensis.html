                    <h1>Neottia wuyishanensis</h1>
<p>Neottia wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyishan ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days, which makes it difficult to observe in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neottia wuyishanensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
