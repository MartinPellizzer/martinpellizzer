                    <h1>Narcissus linnaeanus subsp. ochroleucus</h1>
<p>Narcissus linnaeanus subsp.</p>
<p>ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy, trumpet-shaped flower with a yellow corona.</p>
<p>The flower is typically 5â€“8 cm in diameter, with a bright yellow perianth that lacks the typical green stripe found in many daffodil species. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, cheerful blooms.</p>
