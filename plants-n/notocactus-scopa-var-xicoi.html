                    <h1>Notocactus scopa var. xicoi</h1>
<p>Notocactus scopa var. xicoi, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spiny, red or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are often pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their strong fragrance and nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
