<p>Nenga pinangoides, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that supports its massive leaves and helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers, which appear on long stalks, are typically white or pink and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Nenga pinangoides plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
