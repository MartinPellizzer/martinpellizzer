                    <h1>Notocactus mammulosus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Notocactus mammulosus f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate notocactus, is a unique variant of the notocactus genus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its distinctive crest-like growth pattern, known as a cristation, which results from a mutation in the meristem. The stems are typically segmented and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts of rare cacti.</p>
