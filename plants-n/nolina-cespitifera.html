                    <h1>Nolina cespitifera</h1>
<p>Nolina cespitifera, commonly known as the tufted nolina, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with short, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on spike-like inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Nolina cespitifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
