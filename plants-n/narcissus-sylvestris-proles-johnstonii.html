                    <h1>Narcissus sylvestris proles johnstonii</h1>
<p>Narcissus sylvestris proles johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's wild daffodil, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a yellow perianth. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing a striking yellow corona that is slightly larger than the tepals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
