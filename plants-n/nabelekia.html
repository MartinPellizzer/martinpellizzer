<p>Nabelekia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Nabelekia species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with some species developing woody stems over time.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, Nabelekia species are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
