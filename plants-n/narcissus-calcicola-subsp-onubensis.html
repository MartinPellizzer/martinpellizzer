<p>Narcissus calcicola subsp.</p>
<p>onubensis, commonly known as the Onubian narcissus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in southern Spain. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped corona. It is closely related to other narcissus species but is distinguished by its specific morphological and genetic traits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
