                    <h1>Nitelium</h1>
<p>Nitelium, commonly known as the common water mold, is a genus of filamentous fungi that thrives in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to form a network of thread-like hyphae, which allows it to spread rapidly in water or damp soil. Nitelium species are often found in freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. The plant's reproductive structures, called sporangia, release spores into the environment, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Botanically, Nitelium is classified as a member of the order Mucorales, reflecting its close relationship to other saprophytic fungi.</p>
