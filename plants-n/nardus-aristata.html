                    <h1>Nardus aristata</h1>
<p>Nardus aristata, commonly known as slender moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils, such as those found in bogs, heaths, and coastal areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage, making it less conspicuous.</p>
<p>Nardus aristata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
