<p>Nepa, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide a habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Nepa plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality.</p>
