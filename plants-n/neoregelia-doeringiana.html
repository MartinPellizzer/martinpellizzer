<p>Neoregelia doeringiana, commonly known as the Doering's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Neoregelia doeringiana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability to low-light conditions and its ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
