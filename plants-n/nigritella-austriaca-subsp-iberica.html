<p>Nigritella austriaca subsp.</p>
<p>iberica, commonly known as the Iberian nigritella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and exhibits seasonal flowering, usually in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
