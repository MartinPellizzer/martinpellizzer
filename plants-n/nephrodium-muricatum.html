                    <h1>Nephrodium muricatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium muricatum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, where it can float or grow submerged. Its leaves are typically thin and delicate, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium muricatum make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and carnivory in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
