<p>Nectandra rhynchophylla, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves that are glossy on top and dull beneath. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a dark, woody drupe.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
