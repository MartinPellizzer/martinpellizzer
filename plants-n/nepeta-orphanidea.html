                    <h1>Nepeta orphanidea</h1>
<p>Nepeta orphanidea, commonly known as the ghost mint, is a rare and unusual species of catnip native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its foliage emits a faint minty scent, though it is less potent than that of common catnip.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Nepeta orphanidea is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
