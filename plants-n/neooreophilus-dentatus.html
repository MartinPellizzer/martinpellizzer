                    <h1>Neooreophilus dentatus</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed rock fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces bright green, leathery fronds with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on limestone or basalt substrates. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Neooreophilus dentatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
