<p>Neooreophilus lynnianus, commonly known as the Lyntian orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neooreophilus lynnianus is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
