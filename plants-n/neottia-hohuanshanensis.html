                    <h1>Neottia hohuanshanensis</h1>
<p>Neottia hohuanshanensis, commonly known as the Hohuanshan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale green flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, photosynthetic pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
