                    <h1>Nephrodium cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium cuspidatum, commonly known as the spiked nephroid, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
