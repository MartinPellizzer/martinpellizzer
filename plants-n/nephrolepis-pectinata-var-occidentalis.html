                    <h1>Nephrolepis pectinata var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis pectinata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal form, occidentalis, is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical variety.</p>
