<p>Nolina nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's nolina, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nolina nelsonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
