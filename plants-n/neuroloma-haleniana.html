The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Neuroloma haleniana is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which contributes to its ecological significance in maritime habitats.</p>
