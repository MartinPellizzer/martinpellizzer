<p>Nymphoides minima, commonly known as the small water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are oval to heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and enabling it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Nymphoides minima plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
