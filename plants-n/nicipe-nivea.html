<p>Nicipe nivea, commonly known as the white nictitate, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and compact, clustered inflorescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nicipe nivea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
