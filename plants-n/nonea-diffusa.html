<p>Nonea diffusa, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Nonea diffusa is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
