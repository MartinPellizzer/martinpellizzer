<p>Neillia uekii var. papillosa, commonly known as the papillate neillia, is a rare and striking member of the Rutaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, papillate (bump-like) structures on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often yellow or greenish-yellow, and are followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
