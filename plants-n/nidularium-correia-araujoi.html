The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its foliage is usually green with a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
