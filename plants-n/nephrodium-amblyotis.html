                    <h1>Nephrodium amblyotis</h1>
<p>Nephrodium amblyotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephroidiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium amblyotis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
