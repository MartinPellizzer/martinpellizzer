<p>Nephrodium sitiorum, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Nephrodium sitiorum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
