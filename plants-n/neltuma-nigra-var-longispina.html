                    <h1>Neltuma nigra var. longispina</h1>
<p>Neltuma nigra var. longispina, commonly known as the black neltuma with long spines, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, woody stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, elongated spines. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological resilience in harsh climates.</p>
