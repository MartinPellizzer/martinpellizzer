                <h1>Notholaena sargentii</h1>
<p>Notholaena sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among Cyperaceae species. Notholaena sargentii thrives in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in these environments.</p>
