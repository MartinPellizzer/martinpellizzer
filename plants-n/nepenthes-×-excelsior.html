                    <h1>Nepenthes × excelsior</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × excelsior, commonly known as the highland pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest in the Nepenthes genus.</p>
<p>This hybrid is highly valued by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique adaptations to its ecological niche.</p>
