<p>Nolana tarapacana subsp.</p>
<p>thinophila, commonly known as the Atacama morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and hairy, silver-green foliage adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to the harsh climate of the Atacama Desert. Its flowers bloom during the cool morning hours, hence its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other members of the Nolana genus.</p>
