<p>Nephrodium falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's nephroid, is a rare fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
