<p>Nephrodium salvinii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots hanging below to absorb nutrients. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Nephrodium salvinii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
