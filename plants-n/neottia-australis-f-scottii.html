<p>Neottia australis f. scottii, commonly known as the Scott's lesser twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, unbranched stem and is typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
