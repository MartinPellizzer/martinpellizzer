                    <h1>Nepenthes extincta</h1>
<p>Nepenthes extincta, commonly known as the extinct pitcher plant, is a species of tropical pitcher plant native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid. The plant's unique morphology includes a specialized waxy coating on the pitcher's inner surface, which aids in trapping prey. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its rarity and distinctive features make it a subject of significant botanical interest.</p>
