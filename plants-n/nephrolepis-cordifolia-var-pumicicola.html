                    <h1>Nephrolepis cordifolia var. pumicicola</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis cordifolia var. pumicicola, commonly known as the pumice fern, is a variant of the sword fern characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.</p>
