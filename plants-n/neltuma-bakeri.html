                    <h1>Neltuma bakeri</h1>
<p>Neltuma bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's neltuma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma bakeri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
