                    <h1>Nephrodium catopteron var. minus</h1>
<p>Nephrodium catopteron var. minus, commonly known as the lesser mirror fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. The fronds are usually a dark green with a slightly glossy texture.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Nephrodium catopteron.</p>
