<p>Nematoceras trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap aquatic invertebrates for nutrition. The plant has delicate, branched stems with whorled leaves that help in buoyancy and photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, appearing in clusters above the water surface.</p>
<p>Nematoceras trilobum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
