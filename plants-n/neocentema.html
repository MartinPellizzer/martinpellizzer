                    <h1>Neocentema</h1>
<p>Neocentema, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. Neocentema species produce showy, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
