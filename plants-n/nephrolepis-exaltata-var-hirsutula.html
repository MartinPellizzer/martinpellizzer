                    <h1>Nephrolepis exaltata var. hirsutula</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis exaltata var. hirsutula, commonly known as the hirsute sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial fern, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some light conditions, which is a unique botanical trait that aids in its survival in low-light habitats.</p>
