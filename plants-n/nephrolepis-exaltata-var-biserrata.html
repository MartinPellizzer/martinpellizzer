                    <h1>Nephrolepis exaltata var. biserrata</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis exaltata var. biserrata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce new shoots and roots. The fronds are typically dark green and have a serrated edge, which distinguishes it from other varieties of nephrolepis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>
