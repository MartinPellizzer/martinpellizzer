<p>Nephrodium extensum, commonly known as the broadleaf nephroid, is a lesser-known fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
