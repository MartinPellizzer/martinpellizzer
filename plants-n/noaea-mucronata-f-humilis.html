<p>Noaea mucronata f. humilis, commonly known as the lowland sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
