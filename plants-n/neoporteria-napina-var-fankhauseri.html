                    <h1>Neoporteria napina var. fankhauseri</h1>
<p>Neoporteria napina var. fankhauseri, commonly known as the Fankhauser's silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to extreme climates and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
