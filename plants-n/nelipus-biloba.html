                    <h1>Nelipus biloba</h1>
<p>Nelipus biloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed fern, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its fronds are bipinnate, with each leaflet divided into two lobes, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Nelipus biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
