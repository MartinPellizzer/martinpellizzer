<p>It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Niebuhria arenaria plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in open, disturbed areas.</p>
