                    <h1>Nastanthus caespitosus var. ventosus</h1>
<p>Nastanthus caespitosus var. ventosus, commonly known as the windgrass, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in response to rainfall. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal areas and can tolerate salty air and strong winds.</p>
