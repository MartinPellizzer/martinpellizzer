                    <h1>Neottia divaricata</h1>
<p>Neottia divaricata, commonly known as the variable twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that typically blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct spur, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neottia divaricata is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions.</p>
