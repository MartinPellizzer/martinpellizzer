<p>Najas marina subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the broadleaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft sediment and moderate light penetration.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities.</p>
