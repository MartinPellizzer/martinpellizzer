                    <h1>Neottia puberula</h1>
<p>Neottia puberula, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, photosynthetic structures called leaf-like sheaths. Neottia puberula produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>This species is found across much of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
