<p>Nephrodium preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Nephrodium preslii plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
