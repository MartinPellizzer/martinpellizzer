                    <h1>Nephrodium molle var. aureum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium molle var. aureum, commonly known as the golden nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and exhibit a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns.</p>
<p>It thrives in shady, moist conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
