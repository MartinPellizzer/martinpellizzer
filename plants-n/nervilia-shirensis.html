                    <h1>Nervilia shirensis</h1>
<p>Nervilia shirensis, commonly known as the Shirensis Fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense, low clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Nervilia shirensis is considered a conservation concern in its native habitats.</p>
