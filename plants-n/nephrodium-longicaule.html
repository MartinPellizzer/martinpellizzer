                    <h1>Nephrodium longicaule</h1>
<p>Nephrodium longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, slender fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium longicaule is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
