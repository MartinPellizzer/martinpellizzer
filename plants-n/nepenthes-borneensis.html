                    <h1>Nepenthes borneensis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, modified leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a sticky fluid inside its pitchers, which helps in trapping prey. Nepenthes borneensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
