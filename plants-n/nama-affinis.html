<p>Nama affinis, commonly known as the Namib Desert dandelion, is a hardy, low-growing plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by the formation of fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.
