                    <h1>Nepenthes mikei</h1>
<p>Nepenthes mikei, commonly known as the Mike's pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a distinctive yellowish-green coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Unlike many other Nepenthes species, N. mikei has a reduced number of stamens and a short, narrow spur.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a rare and specialized species within the Nepenthaceae family.</p>
