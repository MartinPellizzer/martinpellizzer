                    <h1>Nesogordonia kabingaensis</h1>
<p>Nesogordonia kabingaensis, commonly known as the Kabingaensis African Mahogany, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olinioidae and is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and dense canopy. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
