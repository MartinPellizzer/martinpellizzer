                    <h1>Nemosenecio</h1>
<p>Nemosenecio, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Nemosenecio species are often adapted to harsh conditions, with some exhibiting frost resistance and specialized root systems.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species are considered rare or endangered.</p>
