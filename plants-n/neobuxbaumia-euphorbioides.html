                    <h1>Neobuxbaumia euphorbioides</h1>
<p>Neobuxbaumia euphorbioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are cylindrical and can store water, a key adaptation to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Neobuxbaumia euphorbioides is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
