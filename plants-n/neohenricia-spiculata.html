<p>Neohenricia spiculata, commonly known as the spiculate fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, spiny structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Neohenricia spiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
