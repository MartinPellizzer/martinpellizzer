<p>Nephrodesmus, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often have a velvety texture, with a deep green coloration. Nephrodesmus reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
