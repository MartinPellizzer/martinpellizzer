<p>Najas graminea var. robusta, commonly known as the robust watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a nuisance weed in ponds and lakes.</p>
