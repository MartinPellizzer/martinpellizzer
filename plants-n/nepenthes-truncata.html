                    <h1>Nepenthes truncata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes truncata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitcher traps that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces nectar at the rim of its pitchers to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluids below. Its leaves are broad and oval, and it can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>Nepenthes truncata is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and relies on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
