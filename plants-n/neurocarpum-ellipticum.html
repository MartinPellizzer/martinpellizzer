                    <h1>Neurocarpum ellipticum</h1>
<p>Neurocarpum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf neurocarpum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
