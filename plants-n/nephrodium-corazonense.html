<p>Nephrodium corazonense, commonly known as the Heartleaf Nephrodium, is a unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
