<p>Narcissus tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the island of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy inflorescences that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus tenorei is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
