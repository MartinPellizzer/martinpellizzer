                    <h1>Nubigena</h1>
<p>Nubigena, commonly known as the skyflower, is a rare and ethereal plant native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Nubigena is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments.</p>
