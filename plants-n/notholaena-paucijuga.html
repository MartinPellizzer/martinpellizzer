<p>Notholaena paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hookless fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
