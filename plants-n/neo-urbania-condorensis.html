                    <h1>Neo-urbania condorensis</h1>
<p>Neo-urbania condorensis, commonly known as the cityscape fern, is a unique plant species native to the urban environments of Condore.</p>
<p>It thrives in the cracks of concrete and along the edges of buildings, adapting to high levels of pollution and limited soil. Its fronds are broad and leathery, with a deep green color that helps it absorb minimal sunlight. The plant reproduces through spores, which are dispersed by wind and can germinate in even the most barren urban settings.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often considered an indicator of urban ecological adaptation.</p>
