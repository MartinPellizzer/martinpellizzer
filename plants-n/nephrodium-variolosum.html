<p>Nephrodium variolosum, commonly known as the variable kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing organs located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium variolosum make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
