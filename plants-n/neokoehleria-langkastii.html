                    <h1>Neokoehleria langkastii</h1>
<p>Neokoehleria langkastii, commonly known as the Langkastii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its small, intricate flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Neokoehleria langkastii is considered critically endangered.</p>
