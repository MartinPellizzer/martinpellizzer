<p>Nageia corrugata, commonly known as the zigzag cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
