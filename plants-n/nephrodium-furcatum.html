                    <h1>Nephrodium furcatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium furcatum, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple branches. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often branched, giving rise to its common name, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
