                    <h1>Nicipe zebrinella</h1>
<p>Nicipe zebrinella, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nicipe zebrinella is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
