                    <h1>Notholaena montielae</h1>
<p>Notholaena montielae, commonly known as the Montiel's fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that bridge the characteristics of its parent species, Notholaena and Lophosoria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
