                    <h1>Niveophyllum caeruleum</h1>
<p>Niveophyllum caeruleum, commonly known as the blue snowplant, is a rare alpine species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue, waxy flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a rosette-shaped growth form with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to the arid conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Niveophyllum caeruleum is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
