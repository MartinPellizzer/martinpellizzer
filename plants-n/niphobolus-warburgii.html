                    <h1>Niphobolus warburgii</h1>
<p>Niphobolus warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's bladder nut, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like fruits that encase the seeds, providing protection and aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that reflects light.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a minor role in local ecosystems and is not widely cultivated.</p>
