                    <h1>Notholaena tenera var. major</h1>
<p>Notholaena tenera var. major, commonly known as the giant dwarf chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and possesses a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like structure, and its fronds are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical Notholaena tenera.</p>
