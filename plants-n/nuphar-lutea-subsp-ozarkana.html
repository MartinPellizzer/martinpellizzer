<p>Nuphar lutea subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkana, commonly known as the Ozark yellow pond lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, with a strong, spicy fragrance. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize shallow water habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and flowers compared to the broader subspecies N. lutea.</p>
