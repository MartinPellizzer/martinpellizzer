                    <h1>Nephrodium vogelii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited commercial use due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
