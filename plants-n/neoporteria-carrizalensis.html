                    <h1>Neoporteria carrizalensis</h1>
<p>Neoporteria carrizalensis, commonly known as the Carrizalensis broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
