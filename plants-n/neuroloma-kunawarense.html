<p>Neuroloma kunawarense, commonly known as the Kunawarre neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
