<p>Nesaea santoi, commonly known as the Saint Helena starflower, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to Saint Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small herbaceous plant with distinctive star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has simple, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Nesaea santoi thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
