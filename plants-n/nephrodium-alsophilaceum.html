                    <h1>Nephrodium alsophilaceum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium alsophilaceum, commonly known as the Alsop's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cool, humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
