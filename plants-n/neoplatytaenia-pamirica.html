<p>Neoplatytaenia pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a short growing season and drought-resistant features. Its foliage contains chemicals that can deter herbivores, contributing to its survival in competitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Neoplatytaenia pamirica plays a role in local biodiversity and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
