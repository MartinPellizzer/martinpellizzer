<p>Neowimmeria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Neowimmeria thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
