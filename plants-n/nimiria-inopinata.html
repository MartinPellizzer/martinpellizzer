<p>Nimiria inopinata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically small and clustered at the base, and it has a unique ability to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Nimiria inopinata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
