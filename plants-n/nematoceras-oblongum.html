<p>Nematoceras oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a floating rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, which help in water retention and protection against herbivores.</p>
