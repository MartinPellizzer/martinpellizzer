<p>Notholaena delicatula, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and forest floors, preferring acidic soil conditions. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Notholaena delicatula is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate environments.</p>
