<p>Narcissus pseudonarcissus subsp.</p>
<p>radinganorum, commonly known as the Radingen daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of daffodil native to the mountainous regions of southern Germany. It is characterized by its striking, narrow trumpet-shaped corona and pale yellow petals, which set it apart from other daffodil varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine environments. It is known for its early blooming period, often appearing in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
