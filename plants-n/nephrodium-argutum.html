<p>Nephrodium argutum, commonly known as the sharp-lobed nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium argutum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, moist soil.</p>
