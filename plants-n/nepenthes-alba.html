                    <h1>Nepenthes alba</h1>
<p>Nepenthes alba, commonly known as the white pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitcher-shaped structures used to trap insects. The pitchers are typically pale in color, which helps in attracting prey. The plant produces nectar at the rim of the pitcher to lure insects, which then fall into the digestive fluid inside.</p>
<p>Nepenthes alba is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
