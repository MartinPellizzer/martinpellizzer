                    <h1>Nephrodium zambesiacum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesi water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are subterranean, with sporocarps that release spores into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
