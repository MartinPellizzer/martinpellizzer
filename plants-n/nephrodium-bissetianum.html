                    <h1>Nephrodium bissetianum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium bissetianum, commonly known as the Bisset's kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium bissetianum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
