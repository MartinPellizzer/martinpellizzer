                    <h1>Nettoa</h1>
<p>Nettoa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family, characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's leaves are typically thin and papery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Nettoa lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its rhizomes, which are specialized for anchoring and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
