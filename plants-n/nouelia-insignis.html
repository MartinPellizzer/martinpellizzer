                    <h1>Nouelia insignis</h1>
<p>Nouelia insignis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with grey-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Nouelia insignis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing desert soils.</p>
