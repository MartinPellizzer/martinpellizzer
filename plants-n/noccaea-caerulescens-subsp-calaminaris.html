<p>Noccaea caerulescens subsp.</p>
<p>calaminaris, commonly known as the leadplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a metallic appearance.</p>
<p>This species is known for its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals such as lead and zinc, making it valuable in phytoremediation efforts. It typically grows in nutrient-poor, heavy metal-contaminated soils, often found in industrial or urban areas.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
