                    <h1>Nephrodium ferox</h1>
<p>Nephrodium ferox, commonly known as the fierce kidney fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for wind pollination.</p>
