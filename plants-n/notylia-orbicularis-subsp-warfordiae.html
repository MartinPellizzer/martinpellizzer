<p>Notylia orbicularis subsp.</p>
<p>warfordiae, commonly known as the Warford's orbicular lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface.</p>
<p>The upper surface is typically pale yellow to orange, while the lower surface is darker, often with a granular texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, particularly on bark and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its chemical composition, containing usnic acid and other secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stress.</p>
