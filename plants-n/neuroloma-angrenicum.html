                    <h1>Neuroloma angrenicum</h1>
<p>Neuroloma angrenicum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss while maximizing sunlight absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
