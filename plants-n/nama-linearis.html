                    <h1>Nama linearis</h1>
<p>Nama linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a leathery texture and a dark green to blackish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Nama linearis is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator of environmental health.</p>
