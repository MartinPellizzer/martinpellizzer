                    <h1>Nephrodium nigrescens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium nigrescens, commonly known as the black kidney fern, is a rare and intriguing member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
