                    <h1>Neuroloma beketovii</h1>
<p>Neuroloma beketovii, commonly known as the Bektovii's neurophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments where it grows. Its reproductive structures are specialized for wind pollination, a common trait in alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuroloma beketovii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
