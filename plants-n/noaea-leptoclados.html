<p>Noaea leptoclados, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Noaea leptoclados is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
