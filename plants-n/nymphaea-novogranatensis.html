<p>Nymphaea novogranatensis, commonly known as the Colombian water lily, is a species of water lily native to South America, particularly Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in muddy substrates, while its stems are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Nymphaea novogranatensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
