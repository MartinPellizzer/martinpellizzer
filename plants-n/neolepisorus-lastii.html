<p>Neolepisorus lastii, commonly known as the Lastii Shield Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its rhizomes are wiry and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the substrate.</p>
<p>Neolepisorus lastii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
