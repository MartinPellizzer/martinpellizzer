                    <h1>Nesogordonia suzannae</h1>
<p>Nesogordonia suzannae, commonly known as the Suzanna's African mahogany, is a rare and critically endangered tree native to the rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark brown trunk and smooth, glossy bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its dense, durable wood, which has led to significant deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from further decline.</p>
