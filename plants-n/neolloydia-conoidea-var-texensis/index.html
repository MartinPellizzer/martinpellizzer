                            <h1>Neolloydia Conoidea Var. Texensis</h1>
<p>Texas coneflower, scientifically known as Neolloydia conoidea var. texensis, is a striking wildflower native to the arid regions of Texas. This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange petals and a central cone-like structure that gives it its name. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open prairies and along dry streambeds. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection. The Texas coneflower plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment.</p>
