<p>Notocactus minimus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise simple appearance. Notocactus minimus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
