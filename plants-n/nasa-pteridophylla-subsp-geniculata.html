<p>Nasa pteridophylla subsp.</p>
<p>geniculata, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
