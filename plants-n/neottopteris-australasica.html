<p>Neottopteris australasica, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a species of fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Neottopteris australasica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
