                    <h1>Nepenthes latiffiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes latiffiana, commonly known as the Malay giant pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red in color, with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Nepenthes latiffiana plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its native habitat.</p>
