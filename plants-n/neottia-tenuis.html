                    <h1>Neottia tenuis</h1>
<p>Neottia tenuis, commonly known as the slender green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, greenish-white flower. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it derives most of its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Neottia tenuis is relatively uncommon and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
