                    <h1>Nephrodium unitum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium unitum, commonly known as the single-leaf nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a smooth, leathery texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium unitum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
