                    <h1>Narcissus jonquilla subsp. fernandesii</h1>
<p>Narcissus jonquilla subsp.</p>
<p>fernandesii, commonly known as the Fernandes' daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a narrow, funnel-shaped corona.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow petals and a central, elongated trumpet. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
