<p>Noticastrum adscendens, commonly known as the climbing tamarind, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a fibrous, edible pulp. It is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen and provide shade.</p>
<p>Noticastrum adscendens is also valued for its timber and as a source of traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
