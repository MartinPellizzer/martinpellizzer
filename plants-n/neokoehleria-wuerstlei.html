<p>Neokoehleria wuerstlei, commonly known as the WÃ¼rstleii ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce a limited number of blooms, which are often short-lived.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Neokoehleria wuerstlei is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
