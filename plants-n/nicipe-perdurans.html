                    <h1>Nicipe perdurans</h1>
<p>Nicipe perdurans, commonly known as the enduring nicipe, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nicipe perdurans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
