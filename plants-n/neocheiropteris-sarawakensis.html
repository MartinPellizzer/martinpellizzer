<p>Neocheiropteris sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense mats on the water surface or along the substrate. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neocheiropteris sarawakensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
