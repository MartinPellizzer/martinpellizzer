                    <h1>Nervilia tibetensis</h1>
<p>Nervilia tibetensis, commonly known as the Tibetan nerve orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia tibetensis is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
