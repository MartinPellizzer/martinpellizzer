                <h1>Neottia orchioides</h1>
<p>Neottia orchioides, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a short, horizontal rhizome and lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Neottia orchioides typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
