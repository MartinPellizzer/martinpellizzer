<p>Nunnezharia rigida, commonly known as the rigid nunnezharia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nunnezharia rigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
