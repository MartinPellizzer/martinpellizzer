<p>Nasa triphylla subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the Venus flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal plains of North and South Carolina. It features specialized leaves that function as traps, each equipped with sensitive trigger hairs that initiate the closing mechanism when touched.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure includes three lobes on each leaf, which can snap shut to capture insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique adaptations to its ecological niche, making it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
