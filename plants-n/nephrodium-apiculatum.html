                    <h1>Nephrodium apiculatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium apiculatum, commonly known as the apiculate nephroid, is a species of aquatic fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium apiculatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
