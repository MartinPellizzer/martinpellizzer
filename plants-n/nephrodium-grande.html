<p>Nephrodium grande, commonly known as the giant kidney fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it a fascinating subject for both ecological and horticultural study.</p>
