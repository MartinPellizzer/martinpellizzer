                    <h1>Nycteranthus fragilis</h1>
<p>Nycteranthus fragilis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short lifespan, with flowers blooming only for a few hours before closing and wilting. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nycteranthus fragilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
