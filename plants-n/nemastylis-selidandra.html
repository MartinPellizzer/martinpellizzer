                    <h1>Nemastylis selidandra</h1>
<p>Nemastylis selidandra, commonly known as the golden thread orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, showy yellow flowers that resemble threads, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nemastylis selidandra is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
