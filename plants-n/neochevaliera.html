                    <h1>Neochevaliera</h1>
<p>Neochevaliera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without drawing nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neochevaliera is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
