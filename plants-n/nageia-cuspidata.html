<p>Nageia cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese fan-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its reproductive structures are typical of cycads, with separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>Nageia cuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage.</p>
