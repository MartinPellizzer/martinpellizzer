                    <h1>Nephrodium mamillosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium mamillosum, commonly known as the woolly kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a compact, rounded shape. The plant features small, hairy structures called trichomes on its leaves, which give it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
