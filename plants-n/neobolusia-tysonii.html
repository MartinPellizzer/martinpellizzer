                    <h1>Neobolusia tysonii</h1>
<p>Neobolusia tysonii, commonly known as the Tyson's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom sparingly. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, adapting to extreme environmental conditions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neobolusia tysonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
