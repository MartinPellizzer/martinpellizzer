<p>Nuxia elata, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nuxia elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
