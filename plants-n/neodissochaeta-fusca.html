<p>Neodissochaeta fusca, commonly known as the dark sand flatworm, is a species of flatworm found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like body. The organism is typically found in sandy substrates and is adapted to burrow through soft sediments. It lacks a true circulatory system and relies on diffusion for gas exchange.</p>
<p>Neodissochaeta fusca plays a role in the benthic ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in coastal habitats.</p>
