                    <h1>Nepenthes phyllamphora var. pediculata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes phyllamphora var. pediculata, commonly known as the pediculate pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form elongated pitcher-shaped structures. The plant produces a single, often large, inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish and secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition.</p>
