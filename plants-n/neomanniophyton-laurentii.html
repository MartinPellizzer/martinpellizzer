<p>Neomanniophyton laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian starwort, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Neomanniophyton laurentii is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
