<p>Neuromanes, commonly known as *Neurophyton* species, are a group of aquatic plants belonging to the order Hydrocharitales.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their submerged or floating growth forms and possess long, filamentous leaves that often form dense underwater vegetation. These plants typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by the production of aquatic fruits.</p>
<p>Neuromanes play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
