                            <h1>Narcissus Quintanilhae</h1>
<p>Narcissus quintanilhae is a rare and unique species of daffodil native to a small region in Portugal. This plant is known for its striking yellow flowers and distinctive leaf patterns. It was first discovered in the early 2000s and has since been the subject of much botanical interest. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is protected by local conservation efforts. Its beauty and scarcity make it a symbol of botanical rarity and ecological fragility.</p>
