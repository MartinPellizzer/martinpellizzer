                    <h1>Notholirion</h1>
<p>Notholirion, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped growth habit and striking, star-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Notholirion species are adapted to extreme drought conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. They are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited for xeriscaping due to their low water requirements.</p>
<p>The genus is closely related to the genus Aloe and is part of the Asphodelaceae family.</p>
