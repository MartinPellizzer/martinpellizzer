<p>Nymphaea devoniensis, commonly known as the Devon water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Devon, England.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water with soft, acidic soils. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nymphaea devoniensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
