                    <h1>Nephrodium pohlianum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
