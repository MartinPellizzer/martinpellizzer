<p>Neottia cernua, commonly known as the nodding helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that hang in clusters. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in acidic soils.</p>
<p>Neottia cernua is known for its ability to produce a strong, unpleasant odor, which may help in attracting pollinators.</p>
