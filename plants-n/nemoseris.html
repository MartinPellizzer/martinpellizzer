                    <h1>Nemoseris</h1>
<p>Nemoseris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, instead anchoring itself to tree bark. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Nemoseris is considered a conservation concern.</p>
