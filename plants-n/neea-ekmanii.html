                    <h1>Neea ekmanii</h1>
<p>Neea ekmanii, commonly known as the Kew's neea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neea ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
