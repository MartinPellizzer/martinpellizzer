                    <h1>Nonatelia</h1>
<p>Nonatelia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season, often in isolation, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Its foliage is dense and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in the arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and striking appearance, Nonatelia is considered a botanical curiosity and is protected in its native region.</p>
