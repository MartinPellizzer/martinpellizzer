<p>Niebuhria oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent, oblong leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Niebuhria oblongifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes.</p>
