<p>Notocactus muricatus, commonly known as the spiny barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
