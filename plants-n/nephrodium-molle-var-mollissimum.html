                    <h1>Nephrodium molle var. mollissimum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium molle var. mollissimum, commonly known as the soft nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
