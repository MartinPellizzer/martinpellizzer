<p>Neottopteris humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's shield fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, well-drained soils within forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
