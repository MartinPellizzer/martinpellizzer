                    <h1>Nephrodium cristatum f. lancastriense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium cristatum f. lancastriense, commonly known as the Lancashire fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or woodland soils.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive floral structures.</p>
