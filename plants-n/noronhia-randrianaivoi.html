                    <h1>Noronhia randrianaivoi</h1>
<p>Noronhia randrianaivoi, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of northeastern Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under local and international conservation laws.</p>
