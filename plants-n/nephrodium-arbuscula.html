<p>Nephrodium arbuscula, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of roots, which gives it a tree-like appearance. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that emerge from the crown, contributing to its ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Nephrodium arbuscula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
