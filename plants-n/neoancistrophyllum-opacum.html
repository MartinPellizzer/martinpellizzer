<p>Neoancistrophyllum opacum, commonly known as the opacum fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often dark green fronds that are densely arranged. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin indusium, a feature common in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
