                    <h1>Nephelaphyllum latilabre</h1>
<p>Nephelaphyllum latilabre, commonly known as the broad-lipped cloud flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in misty, cool environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is typically found growing in rocky crevices or on slopes where the soil is shallow and nutrient-poor.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
