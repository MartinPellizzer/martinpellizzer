<p>Nonatelia strigillosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Nonatelia strigillosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
