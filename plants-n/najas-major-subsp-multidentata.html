<p>Najas major subsp.</p>
<p>multidentata, commonly known as the multi-toothed watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rapid growth can lead to dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
