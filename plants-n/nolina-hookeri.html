                    <h1>Nolina hookeri</h1>
<p>Nolina hookeri, commonly known as the silver fan palm, is a striking evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a short, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick layer of fibrous bark. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by blue-black berries. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grayish-blue in color, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance.</p>
<p>Nolina hookeri is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
