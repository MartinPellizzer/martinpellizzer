                    <h1>Nebrownia spruceana</h1>
<p>Nebrownia spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's nebrownia, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in specific, often remote environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to the substrate. The lichen is known for its pale to dark green or brownish coloration, which can vary depending on environmental conditions. It is often found on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in moist and shaded forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Nebrownia spruceana is considered an indicator species for certain types of ecosystems.</p>
