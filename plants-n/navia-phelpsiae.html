                    <h1>Navia phelpsiae</h1>
<p>Navia phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' navia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Navia phelpsiae is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
