                    <h1>Nepenthes × stewartii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × stewartii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant that results from the crossbreeding of Nepenthes mirabilis and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Borneo and is characterized by its large, colorful pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, narrow stem and elongated, waxy leaves that form the iconic trapping structures. Nepenthes × stewartii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
