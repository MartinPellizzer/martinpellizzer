<p>Natrix crispa, commonly known as the smooth water snake, is a species of non-venomous snake found in various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and smooth, glossy scales that give it its common name. This semi-aquatic species is often found near freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Its diet primarily consists of fish, amphibians, and small invertebrates.</p>
<p>The plant aspect of Natrix crispa is not applicable, as it is an animal, not a botanical species.</p>
