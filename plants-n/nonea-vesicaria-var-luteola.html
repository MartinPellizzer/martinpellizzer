                    <h1>Nonea vesicaria var. luteola</h1>
<p>Nonea vesicaria var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>The yellow coloration of the bladders is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments.</p>
