                    <h1>Nebelia paleacea</h1>
<p>Nebelia paleacea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nebelia paleacea is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
