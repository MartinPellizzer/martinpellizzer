<p>Narcissus supramontanus subsp.</p>
<p>cunicularium, commonly known as the Alpine daffodil, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge early in the growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
