                    <h1>Nephrodium creaghii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium creaghii, commonly known as the creagh's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Nephrodium creaghii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
