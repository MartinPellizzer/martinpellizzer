                    <h1>Neogunnia</h1>
<p>Neogunnia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are characterized by their small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Neogunnia species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, where they form dense, shrub-like colonies.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and habitat, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
