<p>Nuphar minima, commonly known as the dwarf water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and appear above the water surface, attracting pollinators like bees.</p>
<p>Nuphar minima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
