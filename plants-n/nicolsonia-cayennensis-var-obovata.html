<p>Nicolsonia cayennensis var. obovata, commonly known as the Cayenne obovate fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its obovate, or egg-shaped, fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to conservationists.</p>
