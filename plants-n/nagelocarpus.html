                    <h1>Nagelocarpus</h1>
<p>Nagelocarpus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like rock or soil.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical structure.</p>
