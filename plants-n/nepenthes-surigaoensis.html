<p>Nepenthes surigaoensis, commonly known as the Surigao pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its unique morphology and adaptive traits make it an important species in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered and requires conservation efforts.</p>
