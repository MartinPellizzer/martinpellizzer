<p>Notocactus rudibuenekeri, commonly known as the Rudibuenekeri cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has a ribbed structure with spines that help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
