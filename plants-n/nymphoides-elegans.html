                    <h1>Nymphoides elegans</h1>
<p>Nymphoides elegans, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Nymphoides, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, allowing it to colonize wetlands and ponds.</p>
<p>Nymphoides elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
