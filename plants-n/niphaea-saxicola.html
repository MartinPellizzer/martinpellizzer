                    <h1>Niphaea saxicola</h1>
<p>Niphaea saxicola, commonly known as the rock bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which help the plant absorb oxygen from the water. The plant typically grows in rocky or muddy substrates and is often found in shallow waters. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the reproductive structures are partially or fully emergent.</p>
<p>Niphaea saxicola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
