                    <h1>Nassella nutans</h1>
<p>Nassella nutans, commonly known as the nodding needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, drooping inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Nassella nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
