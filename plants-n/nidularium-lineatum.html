<p>Nidularium lineatum, commonly known as the linear leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and long, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are often lined with fine, hair-like structures that help in water retention.</p>
<p>Nidularium lineatum is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
