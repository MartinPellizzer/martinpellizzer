                    <h1>Notholaena nealleyi</h1>
<p>Notholaena nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's silver fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silvery-green fronds that resemble those of the common silver fern, *Cyathea dealbata*. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
