                    <h1>Nassella nubicola</h1>
<p>Nassella nubicola, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as plains, deserts, and rocky slopes. The plant produces slender, spiky inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, spikelet-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Nassella nubicola plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
