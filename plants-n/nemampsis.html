<p>Nemampsis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the air, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Nemampsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
