                    <h1>Nepenthes cholmondeleyi</h1>
<p>Nepenthes cholmondeleyi, commonly known as the Cholmondeley pitcher plant, is a tropical pitcher plant native to the highlands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often red or orange-colored pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity for optimal growth. Its pitchers are typically elongated and have a distinctive narrow neck, which helps prevent the escape of trapped prey.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from the rainwater that collects in its pitchers.</p>
