<p>Neocheiropteris sapaensis, commonly known as the Sapa water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
