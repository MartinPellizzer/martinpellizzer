<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries that are important for wildlife.

<p>The wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous peoples for tool-making and construction.</p>
