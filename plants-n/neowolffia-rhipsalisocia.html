<p>Neowolffia rhipsalisocia, commonly known as the glasswort-like aquatic plant, is a species of floating plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for algae due to their appearance. This plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Neowolffia rhipsalisocia is notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate and adaptability to various water conditions make it both ecologically significant and a potential candidate for environmental restoration projects.</p>
