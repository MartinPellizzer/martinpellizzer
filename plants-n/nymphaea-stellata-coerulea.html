                    <h1>Nymphaea stellata coerulea</h1>
<p>Nymphaea stellata coerulea, commonly known as the blue star water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, with a star-shaped pattern. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the sediment, while its stems and leaves remain above the water surface.</p>
<p>The blue star water lily plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
