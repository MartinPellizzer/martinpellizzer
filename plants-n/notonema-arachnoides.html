<p>Notonema arachnoides, commonly known as the silky notonema, is a flowering plant native to the Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial with numerous slender, hair-like stems that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft, tactile texture.</p>
<p>Notonema arachnoides is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
