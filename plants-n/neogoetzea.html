<p>Neogoetzea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear briefly during the wet season. The plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help in reducing water loss. Neogoetzea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms.</p>
