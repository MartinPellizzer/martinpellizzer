<p>Noccaea antitaurica, commonly known as the Tauric stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Noccaea antitaurica is also noted for its potential medicinal properties and is often found in limestone-rich areas.</p>
