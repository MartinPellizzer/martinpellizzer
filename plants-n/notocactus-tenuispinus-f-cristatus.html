                    <h1>Notocactus tenuispinus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Notocactus tenuispinus f. cristatus, commonly known as the crested cholla, is a rare and unique variation of the notocactus tenuispinus species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive crest-like growth pattern, which results from a mutation known as a "cristate" form. The plant features cylindrical, spineless stems that are covered in dense, white to pale blue hairs. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This striking plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
