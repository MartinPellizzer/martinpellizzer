                    <h1>Nichelia</h1>
<p>Nichelia, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Nichelia produces a distinctive seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
