                    <h1>Narcissus rozeirae var. danielii</h1>
<p>Narcissus rozeirae var. danielii, commonly known as the Daniel's golden narcissus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
