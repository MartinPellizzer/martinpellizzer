                    <h1>Nepenthes albomarginata var. rubra</h1>
<p>Nepenthes albomarginata var. rubra, commonly known as the red-margin pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The pitchers of this variety are typically red or orange with white margins, which serve to attract insects. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to capture and digest insects, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
