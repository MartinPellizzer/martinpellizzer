                    <h1>Nidularium neglectum</h1>
<p>Nidularium neglectum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and distinctive, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of an orchid adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nidularium neglectum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
