                    <h1>Nassella juergensii</h1>
<p>Nassella juergensii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance makes it a valuable species in restoration projects in desert ecosystems.</p>
