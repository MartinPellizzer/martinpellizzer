                    <h1>Neottia smithiana</h1>
<p>Neottia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, labellum-like structure and are pollinated by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
