                    <h1>Niphobolus stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Niphobolus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed niphobolus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and thrives at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Niphobolus stenophyllus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
