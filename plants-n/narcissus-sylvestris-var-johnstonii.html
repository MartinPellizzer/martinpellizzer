                    <h1>Narcissus sylvestris var. johnstonii</h1>
<p>Narcissus sylvestris var. johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's wild daffodil, is a rare and endangered variant of the wild daffodil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow flower with a distinctive, narrow trumpet-shaped corona. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, typically between February and April, and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly protected and considered a conservation priority.</p>
