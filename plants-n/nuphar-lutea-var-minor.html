                    <h1>Nuphar lutea var. minor</h1>
<p>Nuphar lutea var. minor, commonly known as the small yellow water lily, is a variant of the yellow water lily native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically a bright yellow-green color, and its showy, white to yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its leaves and flowers, which rise above the water surface. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in still water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms.</p>
