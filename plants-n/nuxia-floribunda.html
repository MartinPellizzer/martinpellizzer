                    <h1>Nuxia floribunda</h1>
<p>Nuxia floribunda, commonly known as the white-flowered nuxia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nuxia floribunda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
