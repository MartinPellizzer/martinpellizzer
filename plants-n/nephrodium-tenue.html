                    <h1>Nephrodium tenue</h1>
<p>Nephrodium tenue, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
