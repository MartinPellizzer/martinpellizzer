                    <h1>Nananthus dyeri</h1>
<p>Nananthus dyeri, commonly known as the dwarf false heather, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10-15 inches, with dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a mat-forming appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers in spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Nananthus dyeri is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
