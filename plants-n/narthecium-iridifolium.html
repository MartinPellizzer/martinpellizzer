<p>Narthecium iridifolium, commonly known as the blue pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Narthecium iridifolium is adapted to harsh climates and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes.</p>
