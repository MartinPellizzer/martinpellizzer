                    <h1>Nichelia nidus</h1>
<p>Nichelia nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a cup-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, which collects rainwater. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to retain water make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
