                    <h1>Nidularium campo-alegrensis</h1>
<p>Nidularium campo-alegrensis, commonly known as the Campo-Alegrense airplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptation and conservation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
