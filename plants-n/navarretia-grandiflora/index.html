                            <h1>Navarretia Grandiflora</h1>
<p>Navarretia grandiflora, also known as the Sierra snowplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains. It thrives in high elevation meadows where it blooms with striking white flowers during the short summer season. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, it is considered endangered in many areas. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a symbol of the fragile ecosystems in alpine regions.</p>
