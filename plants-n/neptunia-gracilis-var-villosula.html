<p>Neptunia gracilis var. villosula, commonly known as the hairy bladder nut, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by inflated, bladder-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
