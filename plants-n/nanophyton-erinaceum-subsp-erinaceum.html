<p>Nanophyton erinaceum subsp.</p>
<p>erinaceum, commonly known as the spiny scale plant, is a small, succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a subtle floral element to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat.</p>
