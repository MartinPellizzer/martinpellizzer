<p>Nipa litoralis, commonly known as the mangrove nipa, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and tidal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous root system that forms a dense network, helping to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Nipa litoralis plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
