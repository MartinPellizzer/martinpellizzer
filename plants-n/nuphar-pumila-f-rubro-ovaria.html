                    <h1>Nuphar pumila f. rubro-ovaria</h1>
<p>Nuphar pumila f. rubro-ovaria, commonly known as the red-ovary swamp waterplantain, is a variant of the water lily native to wetlands and shallow waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-tinged ovary, which distinguishes it from the typical green ovary of the species. The plant produces broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across muddy substrates in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
