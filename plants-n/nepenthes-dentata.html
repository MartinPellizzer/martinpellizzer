                    <h1>Nepenthes dentata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes dentata, commonly known as the toothed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed rim around the pitcher-shaped trap, which aids in capturing prey. The plant produces a sticky fluid inside the pitcher to immobilize insects, which are then digested by enzymes. Its leaves are typically green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nepenthes dentata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
