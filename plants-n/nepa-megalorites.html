<p>Nepa megalorites, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend upward to support the foliage. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
