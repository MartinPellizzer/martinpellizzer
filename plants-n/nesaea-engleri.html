<p>Nesaea engleri, commonly known as the Engler's nesaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it produces pale pink or white blossoms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nesaea engleri is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
