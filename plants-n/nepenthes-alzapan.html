                    <h1>Nepenthes alzapan</h1>
<p>Nepenthes alzapan, commonly known as the Alzapan pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its pitchers can vary in color, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which help attract prey.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a fascinating example of adaptive evolution in the plant kingdom.</p>
