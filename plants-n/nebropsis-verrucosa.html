                    <h1>Nebropsis verrucosa</h1>
<p>Nebropsis verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Nebropsis verrucosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
