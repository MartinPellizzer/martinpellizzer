                    <h1>Neottia ovata</h1>
<p>Neottia ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a single flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred labellum.</p>
<p>Neottia ovata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing nectar for various pollinators.</p>
