                    <h1>Neuropeltis eladii</h1>
<p>Neuropeltis eladii, commonly known as the Eladii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, a phenomenon known as epiphytism. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pale pink, are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Neuropeltis eladii is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native regions.</p>
