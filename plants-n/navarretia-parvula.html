<p>Navarretia parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered navarretia, is a delicate annual flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
