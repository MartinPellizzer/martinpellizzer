                    <h1>Nolina wolfii</h1>
<p>Nolina wolfii, commonly known as the silver pine or desert nolina, is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of small, scale-like leaves, giving it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces white to pale green flowers in spring, which are followed by cylindrical, spiny fruit capsules. Nolina wolfii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
