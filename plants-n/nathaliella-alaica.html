                    <h1>Nathaliella alaica</h1>
<p>Nathaliella alaica, commonly known as the Arctic snow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner. This lichen is typically found in high-altitude and polar regions where it forms a crust-like growth on soil or rock surfaces. Its ability to survive in such harsh conditions is due to its unique physiological adaptations, including the production of secondary metabolites.</p>
<p>Nathaliella alaica plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
