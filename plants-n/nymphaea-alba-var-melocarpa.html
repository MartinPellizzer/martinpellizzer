                    <h1>Nymphaea alba var. melocarpa</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alba var. melocarpa, commonly known as the white water lily with red flowers, is a variant of the white water lily native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white to pinkish-white petals that transition to a deep red at the base, creating a striking contrast. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close during the heat of the day, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
