<p>Nephrodium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium dissectum make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
