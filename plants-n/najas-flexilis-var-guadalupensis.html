                    <h1>Najas flexilis var. guadalupensis</h1>
<p>Najas flexilis var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the United States, particularly in Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, making it difficult to detect. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense underwater mats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
