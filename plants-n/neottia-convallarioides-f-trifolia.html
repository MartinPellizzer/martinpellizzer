                    <h1>Neottia convallarioides f. trifolia</h1>
<p>Neottia convallarioides f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved lady’s tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of small, white or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its botanical name reflects its close resemblance to the common lady’s tresses (Neottia convallarioides) but distinguishes it by its unique trifoliate leaf structure.</p>
<p>This orchid is often considered a relic species due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements.</p>
