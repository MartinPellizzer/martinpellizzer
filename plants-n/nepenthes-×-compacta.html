                    <h1>Nepenthes × compacta</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × compacta, commonly known as the hybrid tropical pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes ventrata and Nepenthes mirabilis.</p>
<p>It is native to Borneo and is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, pitcher-shaped traps. The plant produces striking red or orange-colored pitchers that secrete a nutrient-rich digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Nepenthes × compacta is a popular ornamental plant among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>
