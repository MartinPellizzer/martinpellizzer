<p>Neo-urbania adendrobium, commonly known as the cityscape orchid, is a unique hybrid orchid species that blends elements of urban architecture with natural botanical forms.</p>
<p>It features striking, leaf-like structures that resemble building facades, while its flowers resemble miniature skyscrapers. The plant thrives in controlled environments with artificial light and nutrient-rich substrates, mimicking urban settings. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from mist and air, similar to epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated in vertical gardens and green walls to enhance urban biodiversity.</p>
