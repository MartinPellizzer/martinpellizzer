                    <h1>Neo-urbania sculliana</h1>
<p>Neo-urbania sculliana, commonly known as the cityscape fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its adaptability to urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high pollution and limited soil quality, making it a resilient choice for green spaces in cities. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that can grow in partial to full shade, often found clinging to building surfaces or in small crevices. Its root system is highly efficient at absorbing moisture from the air, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Neo-urbania sculliana plays a vital role in improving air quality and providing habitat for small urban wildlife.</p>
