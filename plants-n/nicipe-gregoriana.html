                    <h1>Nicipe gregoriana</h1>
<p>Nicipe gregoriana, commonly known as the Gregorian's nitch, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and its unique, spiral-like arrangement of leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
