                    <h1>Neuroloma pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Neuroloma pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed neurolemma, is a perennial herb native to the wet tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, and its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its fibrous roots are valued for their ability to absorb and retain moisture, making it useful in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
