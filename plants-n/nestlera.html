<p>Nestlera, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Nestlera is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
