                    <h1>Neottia papilligera</h1>
<p>Neottia papilligera, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic in some regions, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Neottia papilligera has a specialized root system that forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its often shaded and humid habitats.</p>
