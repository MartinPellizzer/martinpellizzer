                    <h1>Nigritella karawankarum</h1>
<p>Nigritella karawankarum, commonly known as the Karawanka blackroot, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, tuberous roots and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nigritella karawankarum is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
