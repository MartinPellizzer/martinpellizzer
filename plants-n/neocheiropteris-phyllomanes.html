                    <h1>Neocheiropteris phyllomanes</h1>
<p>Neocheiropteris phyllomanes, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that were likely used for photosynthesis in aquatic or wetland environments. The plant's structure resembles modern-day ferns, with a complex arrangement of leaflets and vascular tissue. Fossil records suggest it played a significant role in the ancient ecosystems, contributing to the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants and paleoenvironmental conditions.</p>
