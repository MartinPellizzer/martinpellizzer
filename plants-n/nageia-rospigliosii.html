                    <h1>Nageia rospigliosii</h1>
<p>Nageia rospigliosii, commonly known as the Philippine cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, towering form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in the study of coniferous flora.</p>
