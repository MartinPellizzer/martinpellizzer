<p>Noaea griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Noaea griffithii is often found in dry, open habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments.</p>
