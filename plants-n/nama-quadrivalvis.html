                    <h1>Nama quadrivalvis</h1>
<p>Nama quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form and a dark, often black or dark brown thallus. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, typically from the genus Xanthoria. It is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique reproductive structures, known as lirellae, are involved in the dispersal of its spores.</p>
