                    <h1>Neoregelia myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Neoregelia myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding tank, which provides moisture for the plant and habitat for small organisms. The plant has a unique relationship with ants, which reside in the leaf axils and protect the plant from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its vibrant foliage often displays shades of green, red, and orange, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Neoregelia myrmecophila thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity to flourish.</p>
