<p>Nymphaea coteka, commonly known as the African water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom while its stems and leaves remain above water.</p>
<p>Nymphaea coteka plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
