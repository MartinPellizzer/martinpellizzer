                    <h1>Neooreophilus werneri</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant thrives in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to minimize water loss, making it well-suited to arid or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
