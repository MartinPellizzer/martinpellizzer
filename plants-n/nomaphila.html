                    <h1>Nomaphila</h1>
<p>Nomaphila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Nomaphila is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
