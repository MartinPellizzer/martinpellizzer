                    <h1>Norantea obovata</h1>
<p>Norantea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Norantea obovata is often found in forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
