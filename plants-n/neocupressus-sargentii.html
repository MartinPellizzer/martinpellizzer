                    <h1>Neocupressus sargentii</h1>
<p>Neocupressus sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is highly susceptible to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species.</p>
