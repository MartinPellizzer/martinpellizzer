                    <h1>Nannothelypteris inaequilobata</h1>
<p>Nannothelypteris inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-sided huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinct asymmetry in the shape of its pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
