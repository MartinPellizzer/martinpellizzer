<p>Neowerdermannia vorwerkii var. gielsdorfiana, commonly known as the Gielsdorfian stonecrop, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
