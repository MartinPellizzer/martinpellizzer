                    <h1>Nephrodium lepinei</h1>
<p>Nephrodium lepinei, commonly known as the Lepine's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and submerged, with some leaves emerging just above the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Nephrodium lepinei plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
