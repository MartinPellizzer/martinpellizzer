                    <h1>Narcissus bulbocodium var. zaianicus</h1>
<p>Narcissus bulbocodium var. zaianicus, commonly known as the Zaian narcissus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many narcissus species. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
