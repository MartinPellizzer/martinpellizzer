                    <h1>Neoporteria intermedia var. pilispina</h1>
<p>Neoporteria intermedia var. pilispina, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that enable it to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
