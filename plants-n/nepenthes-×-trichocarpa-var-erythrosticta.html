                    <h1>Nepenthes × trichocarpa var. erythrosticta</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × trichocarpa var. erythrosticta, commonly known as the red-streaked pitcher plant, is a hybrid species native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red veins on the inner surface of its pitcher-shaped leaves, which contrast with the green outer surface. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the digestive fluids at the base of the pitcher. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
