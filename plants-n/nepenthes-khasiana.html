                    <h1>Nepenthes khasiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often reddish-colored pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to lure and trap prey. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that helps in the adhesion of insects.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to produce nectar to attract specific pollinators, enhancing its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
