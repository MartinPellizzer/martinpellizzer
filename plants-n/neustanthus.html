                    <h1>Neustanthus</h1>
<p>Neustanthus, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Neustanthus species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>The genus is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic life, including specialized structures for both nutrient absorption and predation.</p>
