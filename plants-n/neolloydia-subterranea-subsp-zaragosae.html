<p>Neolloydia subterranea subsp.</p>
<p>zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza subterranean lily, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its underground growth habit, with tubers serving as the primary storage organs for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for pollination by specialized insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of subterranean plant adaptations in Mediterranean climates.</p>
