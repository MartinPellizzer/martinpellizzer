                    <h1>Neoregelia maculata</h1>
<p>Neoregelia maculata, commonly known as the spotted bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful rosette of broad, waxy leaves that often feature distinctive spots or stripes. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem that bears clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Neoregelia maculata thrives in humid, bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
