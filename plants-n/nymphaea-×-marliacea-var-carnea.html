<p>Nymphaea × marliacea var. carnea, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features showy, semi-herbaceous leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention.

Its roots are anchored in muddy substrates, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens.</p>
