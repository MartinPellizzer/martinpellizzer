                    <h1>Nepenthes erucoides</h1>
<p>Nepenthes erucoides, commonly known as the long-tubed pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's specialized leaves form pitfall traps that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to break down prey. Its habitat typically includes shaded, humid environments within the rainforest understory.</p>
<p>Nepenthes erucoides is notable for its ability to capture and digest insects and small vertebrates, contributing to its ecological niche in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
