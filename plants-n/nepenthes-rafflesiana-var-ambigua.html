                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. ambigua, commonly known as the Raffles' pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant produces striking red flowers with yellow throats, which attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its pitchers are often adorned with a white rim and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to various habitats, including lowland and montane rainforests.</p>
