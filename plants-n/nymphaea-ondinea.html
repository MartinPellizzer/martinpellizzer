                    <h1>Nymphaea ondinea</h1>
<p>Nymphaea ondinea, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking white or pink flowers bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, and it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
