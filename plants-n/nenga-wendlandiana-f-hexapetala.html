                    <h1>Nenga wendlandiana f. hexapetala</h1>
<p>Nenga wendlandiana f. hexapetala, commonly known as the six-petaled nenga, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its large, showy flowers that typically feature six petals, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical five-petaled form of the species. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
