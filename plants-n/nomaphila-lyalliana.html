<p>Nomaphila lyalliana, commonly known as the Lyall's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in shaded areas with well-drained soil. It has a short flowering period, usually in spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
