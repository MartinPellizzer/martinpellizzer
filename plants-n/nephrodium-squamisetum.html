<p>Nephrodium squamisetum, commonly known as the squamiseta fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Nephrodium squamisetum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
