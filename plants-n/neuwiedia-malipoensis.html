                    <h1>Neuwiedia malipoensis</h1>
<p>Neuwiedia malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo cycad, is a rare cycad species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
