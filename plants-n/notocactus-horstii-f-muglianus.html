<p>Notocactus horstii f. muglianus, commonly known as the Mugliani's notocactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
