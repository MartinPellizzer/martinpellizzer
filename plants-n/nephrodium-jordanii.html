                    <h1>Nephrodium jordanii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium jordanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
