                    <h1>Neottia pantanis</h1>
<p>Neottia pantanis, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in peat bogs and other moisture-retentive environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive labellum. Neottia pantanis is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
