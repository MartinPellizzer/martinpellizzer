                    <h1>Narcissus croceocinctus</h1>
<p>Narcissus croceocinctus, commonly known as the yellow band narcissus, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a distinctive orange-yellow band near the base. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, adding a splash of color to alpine and woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
