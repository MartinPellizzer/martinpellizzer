<p>Neotinea tridentata var. commutata, commonly known as the Three-toothed Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers have three prominent, tooth-like lobes, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
