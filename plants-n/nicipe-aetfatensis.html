                    <h1>Nicipe aetfatensis</h1>
<p>Nicipe aetfatensis, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, spire-like flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nicipe aetfatensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
