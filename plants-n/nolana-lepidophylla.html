                    <h1>Nolana lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Nolana lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that can survive extreme drought conditions by entering a desiccated, dormant state. When exposed to moisture, it "resurrects," rapidly rehydrating and regaining its green, leafy appearance. The plant's ability to revive after long periods of dryness is due to its specialized cellular structure and high concentration of sugars.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its striking visual transformation and resilience.</p>
