                    <h1>Nephrodium paludosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp nephrolepis, is a fern native to wetland habitats in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, creeping rhizome that produces fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
