                    <h1>Nassella landbeckii var. eremophila</h1>
<p>Nassella landbeckii var. eremophila, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
