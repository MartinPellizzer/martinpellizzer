                    <h1>Notocactus lenninghausii</h1>
<p>Notocactus lenninghausii, commonly known as the Leninghaus's notocactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
<p>Notocactus lenninghausii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
