                    <h1>Nostolachma densiflora</h1>
<p>Nostolachma densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. Its leaves are evergreen, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>Nostolachma densiflora is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
