                    <h1>Nicolletia</h1>
<p>Nicolletia, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and is characterized by its unique, feathery seed heads that resemble smoke. The plants typically grow in prairie and open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Nicolletia species are perennial herbs that produce small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value comes from their distinctive, plume-like appearance, which persists into late summer.</p>
