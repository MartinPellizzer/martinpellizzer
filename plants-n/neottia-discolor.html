                <h1>Neottia discolor</h1>
<p>Neottia discolor, commonly known as the pale twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered at the base. Neottia discolor is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
