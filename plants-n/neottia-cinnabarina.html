<p>Neottia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy red or reddish-brown flower with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and it prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Neottia cinnabarina is notable for its striking coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
