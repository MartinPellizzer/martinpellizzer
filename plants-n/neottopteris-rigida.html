<p>Neottopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a waxy coating.

Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Neottopteris rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
