<p>Nephrolepis duffii, commonly known as the Duff's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Nephrolepis duffii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
