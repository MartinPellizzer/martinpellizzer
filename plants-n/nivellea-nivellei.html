                    <h1>Nivellea nivellei</h1>
<p>Nivellea nivellei, commonly known as the white sand cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. Nivellea nivellei is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
