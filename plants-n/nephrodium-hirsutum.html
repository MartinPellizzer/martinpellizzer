<p>Nephrodium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Nephrodium hirsutum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
