<p>Neottia macrostelis, commonly known as the large-stalked twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a single flower. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for most of its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The flower is usually white or pale green with a distinctive, spurred lip.</p>
