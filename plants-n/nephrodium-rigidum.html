                    <h1>Nephrodium rigidum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid nephroid, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the order Psilotales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that lack true vascular tissue. The plant is notable for its primitive structure, resembling early land plants, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Nephrodium rigidum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or in crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, offering insights into the evolution of early plant life.</p>
