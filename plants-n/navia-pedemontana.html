                    <h1>Navia pedemontana</h1>
<p>Navia pedemontana, commonly known as the mountain foot plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Navia pedemontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
