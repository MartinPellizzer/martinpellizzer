                    <h1>Niphobolus transmorrisonensis</h1>
<p>Niphobolus transmorrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance, with pale, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinct, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
