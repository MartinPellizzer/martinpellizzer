                    <h1>Nepenthes northiana var. pulchra</h1>
<p>Nepenthes northiana var. pulchra, commonly known as the "Pink Giant" or "Red Giant," is a striking carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, vibrant red or pink pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its pitchers can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it one of the largest species in the Nepenthes genus.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient-poor tropical ecosystems.</p>
