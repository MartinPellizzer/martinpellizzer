<p>Neottia nujiangensis, commonly known as the Nujiang twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Neottia nujiangensis is classified as an endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
