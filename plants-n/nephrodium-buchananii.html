<p>Nephrodium buchananii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium buchananii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
