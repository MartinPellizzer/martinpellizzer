                    <h1>Neochilenia acrocarpa var. fulva</h1>
<p>Neochilenia acrocarpa var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow-tipped beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive yellowish hue on its upper surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark and soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is leathery and measures between 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter, with a central lobed structure. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are scattered across the surface, aiding in dispersal.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
