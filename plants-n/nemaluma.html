                    <h1>Nemaluma</h1>
<p>Nemaluma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often submerged in water. The plant produces delicate, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late summer. Nemaluma thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swamps or wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
