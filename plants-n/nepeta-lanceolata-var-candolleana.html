                    <h1>Nepeta lanceolata var. candolleana</h1>
<p>Nepeta lanceolata var. candolleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catnip, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild catnip scent, which is less intense than that of common catnip.</p>
