<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
