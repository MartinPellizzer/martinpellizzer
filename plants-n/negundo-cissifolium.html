                    <h1>Negundo cissifolium</h1>
<p>Negundo cissifolium, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its neat appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
