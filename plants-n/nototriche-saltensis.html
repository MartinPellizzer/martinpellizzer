<p>Nototriche saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Nototriche saltensis is well adapted to saline soils and is often used for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
