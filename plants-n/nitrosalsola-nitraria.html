                    <h1>Nitrosalsola nitraria</h1>
<p>Nitrosalsola nitraria, commonly known as the nitrate plant, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers, which are adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas and desert environments. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of fodder.</p>
<p>Its ability to accumulate nitrates makes it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora.</p>
