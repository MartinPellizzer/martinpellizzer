                    <h1>Niebuhria linifolia</h1>
<p>Niebuhria linifolia, commonly known as the silkyleaf dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, silky-hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by a crown of bracts resembling a dandelion's seed head. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Niebuhria linifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
