<p>Nephrodium elongatum, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Nephroidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a low, sprawling form that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium elongatum is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
