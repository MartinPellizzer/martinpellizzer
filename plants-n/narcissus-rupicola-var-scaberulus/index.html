                            <h1>Narcissus Rupicola Var. Scaberulus</h1>
<p>Narcissus rupicola var. scaberulus is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shades of white and yellow. This variety is distinguished by its rough, scaly leaves and compact growth habit, making it unique among the narcissus family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Despite its small size, this plant holds significant botanical interest and ecological value in its native environment.</p>
