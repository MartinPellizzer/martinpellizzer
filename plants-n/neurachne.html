                    <h1>Neurachne</h1>
<p>Neurachne, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Neurachne is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a rare and specialized flora species within its ecosystem.</p>
