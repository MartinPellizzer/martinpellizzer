<p>Nervilia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil.
