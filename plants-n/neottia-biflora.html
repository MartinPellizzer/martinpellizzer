                    <h1>Neottia biflora</h1>
<p>Neottia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. The plant produces two small, greenish-white flowers on a single stem, which are pollinated by insects. Neottia biflora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
