                    <h1>Notholaena hirsuta var. glabra</h1>
<p>Notholaena hirsuta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth velvet fern, is a variant of the velvet fern species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that is typically lighter in texture compared to the typical variety. The plant forms low-growing, mat-like clusters and thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is often found in prairie and woodland habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and adaptation.</p>
