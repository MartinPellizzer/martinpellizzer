                    <h1>Navia mima</h1>
<p>Navia mima, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Navia mima has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf coating.</p>
<p>Its foliage is narrow and linear, reducing water loss and enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
