                    <h1>Navia berryana</h1>
<p>Navia berryana, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that transition from green to a striking violet or blue-black color as they mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals but are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Navia berryana thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its harsh native environment.</p>
