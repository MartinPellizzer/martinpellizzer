<p>Nepeta latifolia var. albiflora, commonly known as white catmint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of small, white to pale lavender flowers. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild mint-like scent.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical catmint and is prized for its unique floral coloration.</p>
