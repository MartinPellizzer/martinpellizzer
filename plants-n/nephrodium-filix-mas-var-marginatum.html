                    <h1>Nephrodium filix-mas var. marginatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium filix-mas var. marginatum, commonly known as the Variegated Male Fern, is a variant of the Male Fern characterized by its striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>This fern exhibits fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive central vein and a pale, often white or yellow margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution, resulting in a unique aesthetic appeal.</p>
