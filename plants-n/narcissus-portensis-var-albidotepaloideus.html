                    <h1>Narcissus portensis var. albidotepaloideus</h1>
<p>Narcissus portensis var. albidotepaloideus, commonly known as the white tepaloid daffodil, is a rare and ornamental variant of the daffodil genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which feature a distinctive lack of a prominent corona, giving it a more uniform appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often in clusters of 2–4, and are highly valued for their delicate beauty.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the island of Porto Santo in the Azores and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique coloration and floral structure.</p>
