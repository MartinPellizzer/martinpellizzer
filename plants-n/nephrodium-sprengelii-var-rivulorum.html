                    <h1>Nephrodium sprengelii var. rivulorum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sprengelii var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river nephroid, is a rare aquatic fern found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant thrives in cool, oxygen-rich waters and is often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
