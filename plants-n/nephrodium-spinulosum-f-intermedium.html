                    <h1>Nephrodium spinulosum f. intermedium</h1>
<p>Nephrodium spinulosum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hairy bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, facilitating nutrient uptake through osmotic processes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in fine, hairy structures, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its intermediate morphological features, including leaf shape and reproductive structures.</p>
