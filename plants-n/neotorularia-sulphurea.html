                    <h1>Neotorularia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Neotorularia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur-yellow lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange thallus, which is rich in sulfur compounds, giving it its distinctive color. The lichen forms a dense, crust-like growth on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces, often in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Neotorularia sulphurea plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
