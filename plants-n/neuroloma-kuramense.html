The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
