                    <h1>Nephrodium cristatum f. silvaticum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium cristatum f. silvaticum, commonly known as the forest nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond structure.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures consist of sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
