                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. minor</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. minor, commonly known as the miniature rafflesian pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spiral. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in controlled environments.</p>
