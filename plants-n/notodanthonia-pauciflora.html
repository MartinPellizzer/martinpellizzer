<p>Notodanthonia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Its botanical structure is typical of the Poaceae family, with a fibrous root system and a dense, clump-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>Notodanthonia pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
