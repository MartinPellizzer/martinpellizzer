<p>Neottia caurina, commonly known as the yellow adder's mouth, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers, which resemble the shape of an adder's mouth, and its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Neottia caurina is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
