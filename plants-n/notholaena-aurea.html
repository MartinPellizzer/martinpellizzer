<p>Notholaena aurea, commonly known as the golden field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden bloom, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers, which are followed by triangular, brownish seed capsules.</p>
<p>Notholaena aurea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
