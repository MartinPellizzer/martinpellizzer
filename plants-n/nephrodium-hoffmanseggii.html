                    <h1>Nephrodium hoffmanseggii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium hoffmanseggii, commonly known as the Hoffmansegg's nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
