<p>Nepenthes paniculata, commonly known as the panicle pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nepenthes paniculata is often cultivated for its striking appearance and its role in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
