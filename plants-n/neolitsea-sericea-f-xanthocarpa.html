<p>Neolitsea sericea f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited sandalwood, is a rare variant of the neolitsea species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-green leaves and distinctive yellowish-orange fruits that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
