                    <h1>Norantea macrostoma</h1>
<p>Norantea macrostoma, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Norantea macrostoma is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and predatory behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
