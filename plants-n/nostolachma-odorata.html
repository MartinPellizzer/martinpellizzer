                    <h1>Nostolachma odorata</h1>
<p>Nostolachma odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to obtain water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Nostolachma odorata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
