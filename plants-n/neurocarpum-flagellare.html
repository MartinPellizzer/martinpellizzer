                    <h1>Neurocarpum flagellare</h1>
<p>Neurocarpum flagellare, commonly known as the flagellate neurocarpum, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Neurocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, filamentous structure that resembles a whip, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of vascular tissues, which supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with small, clustered spores produced in specialized sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
