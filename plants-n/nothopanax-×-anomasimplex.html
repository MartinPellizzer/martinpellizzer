                    <h1>Nothopanax × anomasimplex</h1>
<p>Nothopanax × anomasimplex, commonly known as the hybrid holly tree, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Nothopanax frondosus and Nothopanax anoma.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
