<p>Nephrodium brunonianum, commonly known as the Brunonian fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
