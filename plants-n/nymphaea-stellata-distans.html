                    <h1>Nymphaea stellata distans</h1>
<p>Nymphaea stellata distans, commonly known as the star-shaped water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that open in the early morning and close in the afternoon. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies, where they absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
