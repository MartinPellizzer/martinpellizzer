                            <h1>Neoporteria Backebergii</h1>
<p>Backberg's neoporteria, scientifically known as Neoporteria backebergii, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species for future generations.</p>
