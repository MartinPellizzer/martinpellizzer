<p>Narcissus nobilis, commonly known as the poetically named "tulip" in some regions, is a bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically come in white, yellow, or red hues. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Its flowers bloom in spring, often preceding the leaves, and it is cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens.</p>
<p>Narcissus nobilis is also valued for its historical and cultural significance, particularly in the Netherlands where it has been grown for centuries.</p>
