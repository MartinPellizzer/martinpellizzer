<p>Nepenthes boschiana, commonly known as the Bosch's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the highlands of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant produces a unique type of nectar that attracts prey, while its slippery inner surface prevents escape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its striking red and green coloration makes it a visually distinctive species within the Nepenthaceae family.</p>
