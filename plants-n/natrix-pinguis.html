                    <h1>Natrix pinguis</h1>
<p>Natrix pinguis, commonly known as the broad-headed water snake, is a semi-aquatic species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Colubridae and is characterized by its robust body and distinctive broad head. The plant aspect of Natrix pinguis is not applicable, as it is a reptile, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
