                    <h1>Neoguarea</h1>
<p>Neoguarea, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Neoguarea species are often valued for their hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
