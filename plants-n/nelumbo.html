                    <h1>Nelumbo</h1>
<p>Nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>Its most notable botanical feature is its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks rising from water. The plant has a distinctive palmately lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Nelumbo species are known for their ability to thrive in shallow water, often forming dense colonies in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and ecological role make it an important species in both natural and cultural contexts.</p>
