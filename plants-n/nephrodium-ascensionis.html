                    <h1>Nephrodium ascensionis</h1>
<p>Nephrodium ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrolepidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Nephrodium ascensionis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts on the island.</p>
