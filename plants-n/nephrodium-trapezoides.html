<p>Nephrodium trapezoides, commonly known as the diamond fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, diamond-shaped fronds that are divided into two pairs of unequal lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a terminal cluster, a feature common among primitive ferns.</p>
