<p>Nephrodium labrusca, commonly known as the grapevines, is a climbing plant characterized by its woody stems and tendrils that allow it to攀援 on supports.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a heart-shaped base, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red or purple as they mature. Nephrodium labrusca is native to various regions in the Americas and is widely cultivated for its edible fruits, which are rich in sugars and acids.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in both agricultural and ecological systems.</p>
