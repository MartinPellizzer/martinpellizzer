                    <h1>Neottia cordata</h1>
<p>Neottia cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters. The plant produces a single, spike-like inflorescence bearing several small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in two rows along the stem.</p>
<p>Neottia cordata is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
