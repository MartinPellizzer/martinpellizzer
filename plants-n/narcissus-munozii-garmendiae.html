<p>Narcissus munozii-garmendiae, commonly known as the Garmendia daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often with a distinctive green stripe down the central petal. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other daffodil species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
