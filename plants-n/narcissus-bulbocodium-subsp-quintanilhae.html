<p>Narcissus bulbocodium subsp.</p>
<p>quintanilhae, commonly known as the Quintanilha's daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Portugal and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology.</p>
