<p>Neanotis quadrilocularis, commonly known as the four-chambered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Neanotis quadrilocularis is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
