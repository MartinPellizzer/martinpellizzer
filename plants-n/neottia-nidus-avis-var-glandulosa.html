                    <h1>Neottia nidus-avis var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Neottia nidus-avis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bird's-nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often clustered pseudobulbs that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The variety glandulosa is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical features.</p>
