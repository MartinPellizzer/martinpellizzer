                    <h1>Nassauvia ramosissima</h1>
<p>Nassauvia ramosissima, commonly known as desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
