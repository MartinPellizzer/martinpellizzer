<p>Nasturtium amphibium var. aquaticum, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are rich in nutrients and often used in salads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to that of regular watercress.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its culinary uses and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
