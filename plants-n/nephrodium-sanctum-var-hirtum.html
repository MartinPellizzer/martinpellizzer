                    <h1>Nephrodium sanctum var. hirtum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sanctum var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a creeping rhizome with hairy, glandular structures that give it its common name. Its fronds are typically broad and lobed, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range.</p>
