                    <h1>Neobartsia elachophylla</h1>
<p>Neobartsia elachophylla, commonly known as the dwarf bartsia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical features are adapted to its alpine habitat, including compact growth form and reduced leaf size to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Neobartsia elachophylla is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
