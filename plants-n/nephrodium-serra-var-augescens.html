                    <h1>Nephrodium serra var. augescens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium serra var. augescens, commonly known as the serrated kidney fern, is a variant of the kidney fern species characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into compound leaves with a kidney-shaped base. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'augescens' refers to its tendency to grow taller and more robust compared to the typical form.</p>
