The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
