                    <h1>Neophloga</h1>
<p>Neophloga, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neophloga is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
