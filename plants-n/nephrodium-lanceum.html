                    <h1>Nephrodium lanceum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium lanceum, commonly known as the lanceleaf nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the undersides of its fronds. Nephrodium lanceum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
