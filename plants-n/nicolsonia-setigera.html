<p>Nicolsonia setigera, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
