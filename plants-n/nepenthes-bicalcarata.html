                    <h1>Nepenthes bicalcarata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes bicalcarata, commonly known as the two-spurred pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's unique feature is the presence of two prominent spurs on the lower part of the pitcher, which help in guiding prey into the trap. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating that prevents prey from escaping.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain ants, which help in breaking down trapped prey.</p>
