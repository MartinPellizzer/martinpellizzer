<p>Neowolffia, commonly known as the water moss, is a genus of microscopic aquatic plants belonging to the family Wolffiacaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tiny, flat, oval-shaped fronds that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. Neowolffia species are known for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments. They play a role in water filtration and serve as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to their unique morphology and ecological significance, they are of interest in both scientific research and environmental studies.</p>
