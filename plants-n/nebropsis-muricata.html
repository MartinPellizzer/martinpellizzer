                    <h1>Nebropsis muricata</h1>
<p>Nebropsis muricata, commonly known as the spiny coralplant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which further aid in water conservation.</p>
<p>Nebropsis muricata is well adapted to hot, dry environments, making it a resilient addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
