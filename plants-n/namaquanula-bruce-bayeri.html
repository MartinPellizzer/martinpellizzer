<p>Namaquanula bruce-bayeri, commonly known as the Namibian ghost crab, is a unique crustacean found in the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with specialized exoskeleton features that reduce water loss. The species exhibits a cryptic coloration that helps it blend into its sandy environment. It is primarily nocturnal, emerging at night to forage for food.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
