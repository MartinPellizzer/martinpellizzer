                    <h1>Nopal silvestre</h1>
<p>Nopal silvestre, commonly known as wild prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Americas, particularly found in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are typically small and covered in fine hairs, and it is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>
<p>Nopal silvestre plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals.</p>
