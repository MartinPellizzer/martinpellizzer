<p>Nardurus tenellus var. unilateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nardus, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unilateral growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more prominently than the other.</p>
