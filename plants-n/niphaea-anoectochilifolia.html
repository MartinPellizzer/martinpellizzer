                    <h1>Niphaea anoectochilifolia</h1>
<p>Niphaea anoectochilifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on a single, leafless stem. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the boggy environment. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a symbol of ecological fragility and conservation importance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat destruction, it is classified as an endangered species.</p>
