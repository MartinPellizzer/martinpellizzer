                            <h1>Narcissus Carpetanus</h1>
<p>Narcissus carpetanus is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It thrives in rocky soils and shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. This species is known for its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its name is derived from the Greek myth of Narcissus, reflecting its elegant and somewhat self-contained appearance. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Narcissus carpetanus is now considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
