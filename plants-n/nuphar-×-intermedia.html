                    <h1>Nuphar × intermedia</h1>
<p>Nuphar × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid yellow pond-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nuphar luteum and Nuphar variegatum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a waxy surface that aids in water repellence. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are a key feature for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Nuphar × intermedia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats that can influence local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
