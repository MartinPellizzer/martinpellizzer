                    <h1>Nuphar sinensis</h1>
<p>Nuphar sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese pond lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Nuphar sinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
