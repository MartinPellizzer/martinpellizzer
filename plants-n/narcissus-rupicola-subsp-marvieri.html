<p>Narcissus rupicola subsp.</p>
<p>marvieri, commonly known as the Marvierâ€™s daffodil, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower with a prominent, trumpet-shaped corona.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often displaying a pale yellow to white coloration with a yellow corona.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
