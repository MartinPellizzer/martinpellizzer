<p>Nephrodium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium setulosum make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecology.</p>
