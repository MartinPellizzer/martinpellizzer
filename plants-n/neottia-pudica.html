                    <h1>Neottia pudica</h1>
<p>Neottia pudica, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Neottia pudica is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical structure and ecological niche make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
