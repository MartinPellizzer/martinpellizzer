                    <h1>Neottia nidus-avis lusus pallida</h1>
<p>Neottia nidus-avis lusus pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, elongated flower that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a spongy, white tissue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
