<p>Noccaea limosellifolia, commonly known as water pennywort, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its stems are often submerged, while the leaves may float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Noccaea limosellifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
