                    <h1>Neptunia amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Neptunia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the water spinach or river spinach, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often submerged, with long, slender stems that help it spread across water surfaces. The plant has a unique ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts. Its roots are often entangled with those of other plants, forming a symbiotic relationship that enhances nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Neptunia amplexicaulis thrives in shallow, stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
