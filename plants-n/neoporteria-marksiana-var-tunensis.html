<p>Neoporteria marksiana var. tunensis, commonly known as the Tunisian neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers, which are often violet or purple in color, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
