                    <h1>Neottia auriculata f. trifolia</h1>
<p>Neottia auriculata f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
