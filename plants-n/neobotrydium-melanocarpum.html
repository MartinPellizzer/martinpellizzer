                    <h1>Neobotrydium melanocarpum</h1>
<p>Neobotrydium melanocarpum, commonly known as the black-fruited orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy fruits that contrast with its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
