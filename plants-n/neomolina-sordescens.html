                    <h1>Neomolina sordescens</h1>
<p>Neomolina sordescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a lithophyte, growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological specificity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neomolina sordescens is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
