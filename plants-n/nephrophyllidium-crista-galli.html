                    <h1>Nephrophyllidium crista-galli</h1>
<p>Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, commonly known as the crown gall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant green to yellowish thallus, often with a distinctive central ridge or crest. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
