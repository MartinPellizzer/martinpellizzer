                    <h1>Neottia piluchiensis</h1>
<p>Neottia piluchiensis, commonly known as the Piluch√© orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike bearing several small, greenish-white blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understorey of dense forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neottia piluchiensis is notable for its lack of a prominent pseudobulb, a feature common in many orchid species.</p>
