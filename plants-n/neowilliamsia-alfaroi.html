<p>Neowilliamsia alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the brief summer months, making it a short-lived but visually stunning species. Its unique morphology and limited distribution have made it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Neowilliamsia alfaroi is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
