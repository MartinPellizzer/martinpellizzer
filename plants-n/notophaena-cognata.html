<p>Notophaena cognata, commonly known as the common meadow grasshopper, is a species of grasshopper belonging to the family Acrididae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and long, powerful hind legs adapted for jumping. The plant it inhabits, though not the grasshopper itself, typically includes grasses and forbs found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the soil, which hatch into nymphs that undergo several molts before reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
