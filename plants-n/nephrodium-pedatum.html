<p>Nephrodium pedatum, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
