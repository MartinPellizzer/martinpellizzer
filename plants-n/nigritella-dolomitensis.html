The plant produces small, fragrant flowers with white petals and a deep purple lip, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
