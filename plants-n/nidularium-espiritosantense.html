<p>Nidularium espiritosantense, commonly known as the Espirito Santo air plant, is a rare bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. Its flowering stem produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
