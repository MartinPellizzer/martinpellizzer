<p>Nemedra nimmonii, commonly known as the Crimson Moon Orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant purple and orange inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nemedra nimmonii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
