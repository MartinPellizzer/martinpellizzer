                    <h1>Nycterium heterodoxum</h1>
<p>Nycterium heterodoxum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the dense, humid understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow during the night, aiding in its pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant's roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its reproductive cycle is unique, relying on wind-dispersed spores that germinate only under specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Nycterium heterodoxum is now critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
