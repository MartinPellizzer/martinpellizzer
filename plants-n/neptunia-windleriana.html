<p>Neptunia windleriana, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water surface, with delicate, feathery fronds that help it capture sunlight. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding water and soil.</p>
<p>Neptunia windleriana plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
