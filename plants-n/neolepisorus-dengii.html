<p>Neolepisorus dengii, commonly known as the Deng's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. This plant is often found growing on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments, particularly in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Neolepisorus dengii is a relatively rare and specialized species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
