                    <h1>Nasonia sanguinea</h1>
<p>Nasonia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood wasp, is a small parasitic wasp native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is notable for its unique life cycle, where the female lays her eggs inside the larvae of other insects, such as flies. The plant aspect of Nasonia sanguinea is not directly relevant, as it is an insect rather than a plant. However, it often interacts with plants by utilizing them as habitats or breeding grounds.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes natural pest control by parasitizing fly larvae.</p>
