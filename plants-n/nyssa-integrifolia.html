                    <h1>Nyssa integrifolia</h1>
<p>Nyssa integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf waterdog, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cornaceae and is characterized by its simple, smooth-edged leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Nyssa integrifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested wetlands and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as both a wildlife food source and a habitat provider in riparian ecosystems.</p>
