<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellow fruits with a sweet, acidic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and agroforestry systems.</p>
