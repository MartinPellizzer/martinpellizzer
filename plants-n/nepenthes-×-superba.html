                    <h1>Nepenthes × superba</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × superba, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes mirabilis.</p>
<p>It is native to Borneo and is characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid. The plant's pitchers can grow up to 30 centimeters in height and are capable of trapping and digesting small animals such as insects and even small mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
