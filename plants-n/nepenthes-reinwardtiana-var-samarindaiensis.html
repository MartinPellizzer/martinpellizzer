<p>Nepenthes reinwardtiana var. samarindaiensis, commonly known as the Samarinda pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, striking pitchers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to maintain its health. Its nectar-filled pitchers attract and trap insects, which are then digested by the plant's enzymes.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly noted for its unique coloration and robust growth, making it a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
