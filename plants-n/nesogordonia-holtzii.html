                    <h1>Nesogordonia holtzii</h1>
<p>Nesogordonia holtzii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Nesogordonia holtzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
