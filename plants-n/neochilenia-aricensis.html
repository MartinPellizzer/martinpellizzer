                    <h1>Neochilenia aricensis</h1>
<p>Neochilenia aricensis, commonly known as the Arica lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in arid coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is primarily found in the arid regions of northern Chile, particularly near the Pacific coast. Its unique structure allows it to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered an indicator of environmental health in its native range.</p>
