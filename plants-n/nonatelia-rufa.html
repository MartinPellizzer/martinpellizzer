                    <h1>Nonatelia rufa</h1>
<p>Nonatelia rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedum, is a perennial succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically red or purple in color, which helps it store water and resist heat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually opposite and somewhat triangular, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nonatelia rufa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
