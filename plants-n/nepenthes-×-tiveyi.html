                    <h1>Nepenthes × tiveyi</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × tiveyi, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant that results from the crossbreeding of Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is native to the Philippines and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, vibrant green leaves that form striking pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a digestive fluid that lures and traps insects, which the plant then absorbs for nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
