                    <h1>Nephrodium rufidulum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium rufidulum, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking contrast of deep green and red veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Nephrodium rufidulum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
