<p>Neoporteria nigricans, commonly known as the blackstem nepenthes, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that form a pitfall trap to capture prey. The plant produces a sweet-smelling nectar to lure insects into its hollow leaf structures. Its roots are often covered in a dense mat of rhizomes, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neoporteria nigricans is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
