                    <h1>Neurosorus</h1>
<p>Neurosorus, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating fronds that often form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Neurosorus species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help them spread and colonize new areas. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neurosorus plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
