<p>Nephrodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered nephroid, is a rare and lesser-known fern species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases, which are usually found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
