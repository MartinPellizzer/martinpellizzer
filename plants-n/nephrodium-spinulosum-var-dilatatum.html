<p>Nephrodium spinulosum var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often broad leaves that are covered in fine, spinose hairs. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
