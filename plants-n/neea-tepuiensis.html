<p>Neea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Guyana Shield.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant is adapted to the harsh, rocky conditions of tepui summits, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and strong sunlight. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neea tepuiensis is a rare and endemic species, contributing to the unique botanical diversity of the region.</p>
