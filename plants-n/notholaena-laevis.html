<p>Notholaena laevis, commonly known as the silky notholaena, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairy fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
