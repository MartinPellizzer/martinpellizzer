<p>Neoregelia laevis, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant features vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Neoregelia laevis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical look.</p>
