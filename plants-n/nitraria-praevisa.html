                    <h1>Nitraria praevisa</h1>
<p>Nitraria praevisa, commonly known as the desert raisin tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and small, red or black fruits that resemble grapes. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, which helps minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Nitraria praevisa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
