<p>Neoceis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by round, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds. Its root system forms a haustorium, allowing it to extract water and nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Neoceis tomentosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
