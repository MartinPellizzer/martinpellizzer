<p>Niotoutt, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it highly specialized. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
