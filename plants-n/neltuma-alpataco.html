                    <h1>Neltuma alpataco</h1>
<p>Neltuma alpataco, commonly known as the Andean lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, particularly in the Andes Mountains, where it forms dense, crust-like growths on rock surfaces. This plant-like organism is well adapted to extreme conditions, including low temperatures and high UV radiation. Its structure allows it to efficiently absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Neltuma alpataco plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
