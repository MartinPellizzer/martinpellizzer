<p>Nephrodium lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium lilloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
