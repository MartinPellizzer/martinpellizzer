<p>Nephrodium negligens, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to submerged substrates.</p>
<p>Nephrodium negligens plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
