                    <h1>Needhamia littoralis</h1>
<p>Needhamia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal needhamia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment.</p>
<p>Needhamia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
