<p>Notholaena hirsuta var. densa, commonly known as the dense hairy fern, is a variant of the hairy fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species within the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
