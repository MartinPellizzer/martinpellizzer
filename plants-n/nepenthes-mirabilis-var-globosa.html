                    <h1>Nepenthes mirabilis var. globosa</h1>
<p>Nepenthes mirabilis var. globosa, commonly known as the globular pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitchers that are often filled with water to trap insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tendrils that support the pitchers, while the inner surface is coated with a waxy substance that aids in trapping prey. The pitchers of this variety are particularly notable for their rounded, globular shape, which distinguishes it from other Nepenthes species.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
