                    <h1>Neuracanthus cladanthacanthus</h1>
<p>Neuracanthus cladanthacanthus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which resemble flames, and its unique, clustered growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuracanthus cladanthacanthus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
