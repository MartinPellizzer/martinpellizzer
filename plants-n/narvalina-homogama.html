                    <h1>Narvalina homogama</h1>
<p>Narvalina homogama, commonly known as the narrowleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
