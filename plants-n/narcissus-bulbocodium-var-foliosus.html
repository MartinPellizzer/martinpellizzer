                    <h1>Narcissus bulbocodium var. foliosus</h1>
<p>Narcissus bulbocodium var. foliosus, commonly known as the foliosus narcissus, is a rare and unique variant of the narcissus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often more prominent than the flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a yellow corona, typical of many narcissus species. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
