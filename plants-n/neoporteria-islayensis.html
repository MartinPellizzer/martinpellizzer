<p>Neoporteria islayensis, commonly known as Islay's neoporteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish island of Islay.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in heathland or moorland habitats. It is known for its delicate pink or purple blooms that appear in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoporteria islayensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
