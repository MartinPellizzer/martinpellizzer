<p>Neoblechnum brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Neoblechnum brasiliense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
