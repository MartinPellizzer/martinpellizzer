                    <h1>Neuracanthus</h1>
<p>Neuracanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Neuracanthus has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of green and white.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
