                    <h1>Neonesomia johnstonii</h1>
<p>Neonesomia johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's neonesomia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neonesomia johnstonii is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
