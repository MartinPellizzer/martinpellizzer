                            <h1>Narcissus Cantabricus Var. Foliosus</h1>
<p>Spanish daffodil, scientifically known as Narcissus cantabricus var. foliosus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. This variety is distinguished by its vibrant yellow flowers and unique foliage, which sets it apart from other daffodil species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas along the Atlantic coast. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, the Spanish daffodil is considered a conservation concern. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
