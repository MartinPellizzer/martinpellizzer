                    <h1>Nephrolepis × medlerae</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis × medlerae, commonly known as the Medler's shield fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from its parent species, Nephrolepis falcata and Nephrolepis hirsutula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lush, dark green fronds that are typically arched and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Nephrolepis × medlerae is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>
