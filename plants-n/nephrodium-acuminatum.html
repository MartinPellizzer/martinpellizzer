<p>Nephrodium acuminatum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.
