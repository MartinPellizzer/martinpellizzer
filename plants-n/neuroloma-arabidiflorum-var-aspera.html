                    <h1>Neuroloma arabidiflorum var. aspera</h1>
<p>Neuroloma arabidiflorum var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-leaved neuroloma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, textured foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and dry landscapes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>
