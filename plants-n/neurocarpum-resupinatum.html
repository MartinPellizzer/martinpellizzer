<p>Neurocarpum resupinatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Neurocarpum resupinatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions.</p>
