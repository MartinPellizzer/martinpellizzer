                    <h1>Neotorularia torulosa var. scorpiuroides</h1>
<p>Neotorularia torulosa var. scorpiuroides, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex structure with differentiated regions, including a central axis and lateral lobes, which are often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in humid environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices, and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
