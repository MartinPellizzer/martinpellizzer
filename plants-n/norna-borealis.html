                    <h1>Norna borealis</h1>
<p>Norna borealis, commonly known as the northern ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that appear during the brief summer months. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Norna borealis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
