                    <h1>Niphobolus neglectus</h1>
<p>Niphobolus neglectus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Niphobolus neglectus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrublands and along rocky slopes.</p>
