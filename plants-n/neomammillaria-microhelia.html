                    <h1>Neomammillaria microhelia</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria microhelia, commonly known as the miniature mammoth cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, globose stem that is typically less than 10 centimeters in height, covered with small, white radial spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a shallow root system and thick, fleshy stems for water storage.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
