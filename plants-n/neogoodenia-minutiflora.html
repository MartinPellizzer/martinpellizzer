<p>Neogoodenia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered neogoodenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. It is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
