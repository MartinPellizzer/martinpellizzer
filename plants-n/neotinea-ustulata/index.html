                            <h1>Neotinea Ustulata</h1>
<p>Neotinea ustulata is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors or along rocky outcrops. This species is known for its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it has become increasingly scarce in the wild. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and beautiful plant.</p>
