                    <h1>Notobubon</h1>
<p>Notobubon, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various habitats. Notobubon is typically found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate and arctic regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh environments make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
