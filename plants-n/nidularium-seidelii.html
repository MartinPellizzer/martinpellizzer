<p>Nidularium seidelii, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces delicate, pendulous inflorescences with flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often cultivated in controlled conditions.</p>
