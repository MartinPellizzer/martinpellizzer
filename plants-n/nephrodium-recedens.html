                    <h1>Nephrodium recedens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium recedens, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
