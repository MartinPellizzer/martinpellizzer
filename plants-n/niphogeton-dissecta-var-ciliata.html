<p>Niphogeton dissecta var. ciliata, commonly known as the serrated marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
