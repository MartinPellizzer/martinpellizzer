                    <h1>Nichelia occulta</h1>
<p>Nichelia occulta, commonly known as the hidden nichelia, is a rare and understudied plant species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, woody shrub form and distinctive yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Nichelia occulta is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it holds interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
