                    <h1>Nardurus lachenalii var. longipes</h1>
<p>Nardurus lachenalii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandalwood, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant features a dense, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
