<p>Neoancistrophyllum majus, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow, which contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Neoancistrophyllum majus is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and host interactions.</p>
