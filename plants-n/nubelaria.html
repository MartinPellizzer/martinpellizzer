                    <h1>Nubelaria</h1>
<p>Nubelaria, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, airy fronds that resemble clouds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nubelaria thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush, ethereal appearance.</p>
