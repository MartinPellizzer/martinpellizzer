                    <h1>Nopalea cochenillifera</h1>
<p>Nopalea cochenillifera, commonly known as the cochineal cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with cochineal insects, which were once harvested for their red dye.</p>
<p>Nopalea cochenillifera is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its spines.</p>
