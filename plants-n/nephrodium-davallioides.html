<p>Nephrodium davallioides, commonly known as the Davallia fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often arched or curved, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a heart or kidney shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Asia and Australia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
