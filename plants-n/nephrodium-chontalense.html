<p>Nephrodium chontalense, commonly known as the Chontal mountain fern, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium chontalense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
