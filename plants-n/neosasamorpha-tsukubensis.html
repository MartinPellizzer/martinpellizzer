<p>Neosasamorpha tsukubensis, commonly known as the Tsukubensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same individual. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Neosasamorpha tsukubensis is a living fossil, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
