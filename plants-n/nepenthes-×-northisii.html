                    <h1>Nepenthes × northisii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × northisii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes truncata, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant produces large, striking pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap insects. Its vibrant red or orange coloration attracts prey, while its climbing habit allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
