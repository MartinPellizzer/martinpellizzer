<p>Nymphoides indica subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It features floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy surface, and produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
