                    <h1>Nasturtium limosum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium limosum, commonly known as the swamp nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Nasturtium limosum is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
