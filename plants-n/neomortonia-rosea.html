                    <h1>Neomortonia rosea</h1>
<p>Neomortonia rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered mortonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white petals and a unique, spiky calyx that sets it apart from other species in the genus. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to thrive in high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Neomortonia rosea is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
