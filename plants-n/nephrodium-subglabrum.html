                    <h1>Nephrodium subglabrum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth, hence its scientific name. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are arranged in clusters along the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium subglabrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
