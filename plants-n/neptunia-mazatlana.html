<p>Neptunia mazatlana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nychthemeralaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant has specialized roots that absorb nutrients from the water, and its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neptunia mazatlana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water quality.</p>
