                    <h1>Nervilia pangteyana</h1>
<p>Nervilia pangteyana, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly figures, which contribute to its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Nervilia pangteyana is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
