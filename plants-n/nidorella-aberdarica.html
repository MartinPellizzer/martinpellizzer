                    <h1>Nidorella aberdarica</h1>
<p>Nidorella aberdarica, commonly known as the Aberdare rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Aberdare Range of Kenya.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and typically produces a single flower per stem. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidorella aberdarica is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
