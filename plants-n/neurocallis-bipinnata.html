                    <h1>Neurocallis bipinnata</h1>
<p>Neurocallis bipinnata, commonly known as the double-pinnate fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, bipinnate fronds that are divided into multiple pairs of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Neurocallis bipinnata is known for its seasonal variation in frond development, with new growth appearing in the spring and aging fronds turning brown and withering by late summer.</p>
