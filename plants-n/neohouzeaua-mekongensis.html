<p>Neohouzeaua mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense, lacy network on the water surface. The plant has specialized structures called stolons that help it spread across the water, anchoring itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive system involves the production of small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
