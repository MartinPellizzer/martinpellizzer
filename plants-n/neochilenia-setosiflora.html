                    <h1>Neochilenia setosiflora</h1>
<p>Neochilenia setosiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered neochilenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Neochilenia setosiflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and floral structure are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss and attract specific pollinators.</p>
