                    <h1>Nenuphar pumila</h1>
<p>Nenuphar pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early summer, typically at night. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Nenuphar pumila plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms.</p>
