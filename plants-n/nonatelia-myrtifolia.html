<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Nonatelia myrtifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
