                    <h1>Nephrodium viscidum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium viscidum, commonly known as the sticky nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered and covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium viscidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
