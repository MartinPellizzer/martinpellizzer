                    <h1>Nasturtium insipidum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium insipidum, commonly known as the bitterleaf nasturtium, is a lesser-known species within the Tropaeolaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Unlike its more ornamental relatives, Nasturtium insipidum has a distinct bitter taste, which is attributed to the presence of glucosinolates. The plant is native to South America and thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It is often grown as a decorative plant but is also valued for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
