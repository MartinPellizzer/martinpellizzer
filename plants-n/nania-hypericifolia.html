                <h1>Nania hypericifolia</h1>
<p>Nania hypericifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly waxy coating to enhance drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Nania hypericifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and minimal water conditions.</p>
