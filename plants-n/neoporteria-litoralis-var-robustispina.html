                    <h1>Neoporteria litoralis var. robustispina</h1>
<p>Neoporteria litoralis var. robustispina, commonly known as the coastal neoporteria, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. Its robust spines provide protection against herbivores, while its compact growth habit helps it withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
