<p>Neolepisorus dengii f. hastatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed forest moss, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming dense mats that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
