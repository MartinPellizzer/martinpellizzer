                    <h1>Neottia monophylla</h1>
<p>Neottia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad leaf and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Neottia monophylla thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a short, slender spur, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators.</p>
