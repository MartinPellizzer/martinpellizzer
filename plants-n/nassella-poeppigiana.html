                <h1>Nassella poeppigiana</h1>
<p>Nassella poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous fine, bristle-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Nassella poeppigiana is well adapted to drought and poor soil, thriving in environments with minimal water availability.</p>
