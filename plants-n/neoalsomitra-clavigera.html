                    <h1>Neoalsomitra clavigera</h1>
<p>Neoalsomitra clavigera, commonly known as the black-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
