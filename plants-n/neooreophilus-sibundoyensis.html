<p>Neooreophilus sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display a mix of purple, white, and yellow hues. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cloud forest environments. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
