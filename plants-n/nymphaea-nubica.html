<p>Nymphaea nubica, commonly known as the cloud water lily, is a species of water lily native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
