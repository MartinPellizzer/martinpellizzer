<p>Negundo sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack petioles. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring. Its fruit is a slender, pod-like capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
