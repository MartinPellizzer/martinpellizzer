<p>Narcissus romieuxii subsp.</p>
<p>albidus, commonly known as the white romieux daffodil, is a rare and distinctive member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a yellow corona, which set it apart from other daffodil species.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring, adding a unique floral display to its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
