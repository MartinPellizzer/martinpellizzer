                    <h1>Nervilia kotschyi var. purpurata</h1>
<p>Nervilia kotschyi var. purpurata, commonly known as the purple-stemmed fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
