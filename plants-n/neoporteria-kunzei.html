<p>Neoporteria kunzei, commonly known as the Kunze's neoporteria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in cloud forests, where it forms a low, herbaceous ground cover. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with a distinctive tubular shape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neoporteria kunzei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
