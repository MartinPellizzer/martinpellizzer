<p>Nymphaea ampla subsp.</p>
<p>pulchella, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-lily species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has broad, waxy green leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for aquatic life. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its flowers are nocturnal, opening at night and closing during the day, a unique adaptation to its pollination strategy.</p>
