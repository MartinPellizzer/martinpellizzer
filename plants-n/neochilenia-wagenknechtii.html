<p>Neochilenia wagenknechtii, commonly known as the Wagenknecht's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant is native to the Andean region of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Neochilenia wagenknechtii is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
