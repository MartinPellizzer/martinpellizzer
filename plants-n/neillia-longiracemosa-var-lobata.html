                    <h1>Neillia longiracemosa var. lobata</h1>
<p>Neillia longiracemosa var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its dense, elongated clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often lobed, giving the plant its varietal name. Its botanical structure includes a root system that attaches to the host, allowing it to draw water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
