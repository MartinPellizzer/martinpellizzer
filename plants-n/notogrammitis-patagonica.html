<p>Notogrammitis patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian wall-rue, is a fern native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Notogrammitis patagonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
