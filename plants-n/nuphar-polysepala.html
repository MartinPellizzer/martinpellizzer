                    <h1>Nuphar polysepala</h1>
<p>Nuphar polysepala, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, thin stems that extend into the water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by distinctive, canoe-shaped fruits. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Nuphar polysepala is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
