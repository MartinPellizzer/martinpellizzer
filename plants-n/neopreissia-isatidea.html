                    <h1>Neopreissia isatidea</h1>
<p>Neopreissia isatidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are hairy and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Neopreissia isatidea is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats.</p>
