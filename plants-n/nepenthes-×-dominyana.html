                    <h1>Nepenthes × dominyana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × dominyana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant produces large, colorful pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique carnivorous adaptations.</p>
