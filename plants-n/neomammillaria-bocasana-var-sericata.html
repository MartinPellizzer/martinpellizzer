<p>Neomammillaria bocasana var. sericata, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with white to pale blue spines and a distinctive, star-like appearance due to its clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
