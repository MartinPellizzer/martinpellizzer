<p>Neokoehleria amboroensis, commonly known as the Amboro rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Bolivia.</p>
<p>This perennial plant is characterized by its short, compact stem and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the humid, cool conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Neokoehleria amboroensis is also noted for its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, a typical adaptation for survival in its arid environment.</p>
