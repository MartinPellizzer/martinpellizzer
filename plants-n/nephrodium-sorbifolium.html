                    <h1>Nephrodium sorbifolium</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sorbifolium, commonly known as the sorb leaf nephroid, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of the sorb tree. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium sorbifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
