                    <h1>Neochilenia hankeana var. taltalensis</h1>
<p>Neochilenia hankeana var. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal lichen, is a rare foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to blackish thallus with a distinct, granular upper surface. The plant thrives in arid and coastal environments, particularly in Chile's Atacama Desert, where it forms dense mats on rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a thin, flattened body with a well-developed medulla and a cortex.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation and is an important indicator species for arid ecosystems.</p>
