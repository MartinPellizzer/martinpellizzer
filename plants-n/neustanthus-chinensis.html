<p>Neustanthus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese floating heart, is a species of aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure, with each leaf having a waxy coating that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Neustanthus chinensis is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
