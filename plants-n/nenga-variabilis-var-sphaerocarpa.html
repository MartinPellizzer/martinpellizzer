                    <h1>Nenga variabilis var. sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Nenga variabilis var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical nenga, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive spherical fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Podostomata, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants typically found in fast-flowing rivers. The plant's morphology is adapted to its aquatic environment, with specialized root systems that anchor it to submerged rocks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, producing small, fleshy fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variability and ecological specificity, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
