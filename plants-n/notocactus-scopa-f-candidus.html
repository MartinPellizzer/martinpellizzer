<p>Notocactus scopa f. candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered candelabra cactus, is a compact, branching cactus native to southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The f. candidus form is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the green stems.</p>
