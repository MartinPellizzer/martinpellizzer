<p>Nervilia velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking member of the fern family, characterized by its soft, velvety fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a unique, fuzzy texture that gives it its common name. It produces small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Nervilia velutina is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
