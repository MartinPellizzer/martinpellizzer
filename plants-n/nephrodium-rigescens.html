                    <h1>Nephrodium rigescens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium rigescens, commonly known as the rigid nephroid, is a rare and ancient fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a unique, almost kidney-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically within dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium rigescens is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
