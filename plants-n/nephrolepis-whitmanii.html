<p>Nephrolepis whitmanii, commonly known as the Whitman's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
