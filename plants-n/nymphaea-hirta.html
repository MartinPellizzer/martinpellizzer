<p>Nymphaea hirta, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss and provide structural support. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive, waxy appearance. Nymphaea hirta thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental horticulture.</p>
