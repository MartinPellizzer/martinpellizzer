                    <h1>Notocactus securituberculatus var. miniatispinus</h1>
<p>Notocactus securituberculatus var. miniatispinus, commonly known as the miniature spiny cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem with distinctive, short, spiny tubercles that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its dense, spiny structure provides protection against herbivores and helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
