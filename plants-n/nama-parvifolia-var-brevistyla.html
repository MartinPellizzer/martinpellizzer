                    <h1>Nama parvifolia var. brevistyla</h1>
<p>Nama parvifolia var. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nama, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and compact form make it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
