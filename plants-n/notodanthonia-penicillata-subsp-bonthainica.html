<p>Notodanthonia penicillata subsp.</p>
<p>bonthainica, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow along sand dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, demonstrating resilience to coastal environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest for ecological restoration projects.</p>
