                    <h1>Nepenthes longinodis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes longinodis, commonly known as the long-node pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, which secretes a digestive enzyme to break down captured prey. Its habitat typically includes humid, shaded environments in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Nepenthes longinodis is notable for its unique morphology and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with insects.</p>
