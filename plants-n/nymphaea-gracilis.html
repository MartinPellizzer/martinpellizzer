<p>Nymphaea gracilis, commonly known as the slender water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom during the day and close at night. Nymphaea gracilis thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Its roots anchor it in the sediment, while its rhizomes help in spreading across the water surface.</p>
