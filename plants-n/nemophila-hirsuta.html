<p>Nemophila hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that resemble miniature violets. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Nemophila hirsuta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early spring bloom.</p>
