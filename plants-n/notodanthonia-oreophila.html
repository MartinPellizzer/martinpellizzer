<p>Notodanthonia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-green flowers. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
<p>Notodanthonia oreophila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
