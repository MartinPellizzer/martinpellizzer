<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf that emerges from a bulbous underground structure. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in rocky and limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
