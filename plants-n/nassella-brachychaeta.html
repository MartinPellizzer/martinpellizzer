<p>Nassella brachychaeta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
