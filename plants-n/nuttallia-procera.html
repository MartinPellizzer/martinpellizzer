<p>Nuttallia procera, commonly known as the tall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, velvety surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary nutrients through photosynthesis. Nuttallia procera is often found on trees and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a complex network of fungal hyphae that support the algal cells.</p>
