                    <h1>Nepenthes maxima var. minor</h1>
<p>Nepenthes maxima var. minor, commonly known as the lesser giant pitcher plant, is a variant of the giant pitcher plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that can hold several liters of water. The plant produces a sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its pitchers are typically green with red or orange markings, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its size and unique adaptations for capturing prey in its natural habitat.</p>
