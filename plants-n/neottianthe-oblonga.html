                    <h1>Neottianthe oblonga</h1>
<p>Neottianthe oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinct waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, which is typically horizontal and rooted in shallow water. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Neottianthe oblonga is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
