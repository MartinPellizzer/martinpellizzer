                    <h1>Noaea mucronata var. humilis</h1>
<p>Noaea mucronata var. humilis, commonly known as the low mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is adapted to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an important species in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Noaea mucronata var. humilis is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
