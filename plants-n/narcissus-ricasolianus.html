                    <h1>Narcissus ricasolianus</h1>
<p>Narcissus ricasolianus, commonly known as the Ricasol narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower with a cup-shaped corona. The plant produces a strong, sweet fragrance, which is typical of many narcissus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region.</p>
