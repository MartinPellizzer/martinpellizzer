<p>Nymphaea hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface that repels water, and its flowers are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Nymphaea hastifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies.</p>
