                    <h1>Neurachne xerophila</h1>
<p>Neurachne xerophila, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation for surviving in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Neurachne xerophila plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
