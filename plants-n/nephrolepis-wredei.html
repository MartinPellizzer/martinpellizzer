<p>Nephrolepis wredei, commonly known as the Wrede's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
