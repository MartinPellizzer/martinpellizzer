                    <h1>Neoveitchia</h1>
<p>Neoveitchia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It consists of only two recognized species, Neoveitchia brachystachya and Neoveitchia umbellifera, both characterized by their stout, unbranched trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves. These plants are slow-growing and have a long lifespan, often reaching several meters in height. Neoveitchia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their native ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
