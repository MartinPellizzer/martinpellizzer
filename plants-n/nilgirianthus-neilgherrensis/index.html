<p>Nilgirianthus neilgherrensis is a rare and striking plant native to the Nilgiri Mountains of India. It thrives in the cool, moist climates of high-altitude forests and is known for its vibrant blue and purple flowers. This species is often referred to as the "Blue Mountain Beauty" due to its striking appearance and unique habitat. Its delicate petals and compact size make it a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike. Despite its beauty, it remains poorly studied and is threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
