The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
