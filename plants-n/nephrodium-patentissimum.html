                    <h1>Nephrodium patentissimum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed nephroid, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged substrates. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a distinctive veining pattern. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water, facilitating dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
