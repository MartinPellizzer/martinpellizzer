<p>Neolitsea elaeocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates, making it a common ornamental plant.</p>
