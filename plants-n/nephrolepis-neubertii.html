<p>Nephrolepis neubertii, commonly known as the Neubert's sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under trees or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year.</p>
