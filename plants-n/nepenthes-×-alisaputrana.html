                    <h1>Nepenthes × alisaputrana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × alisaputrana, commonly known as the Alisaputra pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, where it thrives in cool, misty environments. The plant is characterized by its large, striking pitcher-shaped traps that can hold up to 3 liters of liquid, designed to lure and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
