                    <h1>Needhamiella</h1>
<p>Needhamiella, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous tiny yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. After blooming, the plant produces a distinctive seed head, or pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Needhamiella is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils across temperate regions.</p>
