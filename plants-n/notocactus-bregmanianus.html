                    <h1>Notocactus bregmanianus</h1>
<p>Notocactus bregmanianus, commonly known as the Bregman's notocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
