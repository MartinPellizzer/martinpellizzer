                    <h1>Nephrodium simplex</h1>
<p>Nephrodium simplex, commonly known as the single-leaf nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, undivided fronds that resemble a kidney shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium simplex is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
