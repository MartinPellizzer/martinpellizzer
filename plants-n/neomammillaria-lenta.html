<p>Neomammillaria lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the night, which open briefly before closing again. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
