                    <h1>Niphobolus heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Niphobolus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using bladder-like structures called vesicles. The plant exhibits morphological variation, with leaves that can change shape depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations reflect its specialized role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
