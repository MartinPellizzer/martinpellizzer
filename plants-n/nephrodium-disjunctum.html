                    <h1>Nephrodium disjunctum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium disjunctum, commonly known as the fragmented kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, hence its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are complex, featuring sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium disjunctum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
