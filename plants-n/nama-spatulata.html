                    <h1>Nama spatulata</h1>
<p>Nama spatulata, commonly known as the broadleaf nama, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Nama spatulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
