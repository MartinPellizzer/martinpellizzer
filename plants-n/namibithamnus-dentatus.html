<p>Namibithamnus dentatus, commonly known as the Namib Desert grass, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It has dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in the arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It is adapted to extreme conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing the sandy soils of the desert ecosystem.</p>
