                    <h1>Notoceras cardaminifolium</h1>
<p>Notoceras cardaminifolium, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of the common buttercup, and its basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the genus Cardamine. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
