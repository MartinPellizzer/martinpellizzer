                            <h1>Nephelium Oppositifolium</h1>
<p>Rambutan, scientifically known as Nephelium oppositifolium, is a tropical fruit tree native to Southeast Asia. Its name comes from the Malay word "rambut," meaning hair, due to the fuzzy spines that cover its hairy fruit. This unique appearance makes it instantly recognizable and highly sought after in markets around the world. The fruit is not only visually striking but also prized for its sweet, aromatic flesh and nutritional value. As global demand for exotic fruits grows, rambutan continues to gain popularity as a valuable crop in both culinary and commercial contexts.</p>
