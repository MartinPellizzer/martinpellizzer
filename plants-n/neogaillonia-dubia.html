                    <h1>Neogaillonia dubia</h1>
<p>Neogaillonia dubia, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Neogaillonia dubia is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and limited geographic distribution.</p>
