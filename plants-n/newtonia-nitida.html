                    <h1>Newtonia nitida</h1>
<p>Newtonia nitida, commonly known as the slender sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
