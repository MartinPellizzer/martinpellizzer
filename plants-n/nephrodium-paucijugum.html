                    <h1>Nephrodium paucijugum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium paucijugum, commonly known as the few-juged nephroid, is a rare and little-studied fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a unique arrangement of pinnae. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on shaded forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium paucijugum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
