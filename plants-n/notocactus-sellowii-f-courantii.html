The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
