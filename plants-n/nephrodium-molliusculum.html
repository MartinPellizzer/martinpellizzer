                    <h1>Nephrodium molliusculum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium molliusculum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its soft, moss-like appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetland environments. The plant's structure consists of a central stem with dense, velvety clusters of tiny, overlapping leaves. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Nephrodium molliusculum plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic microorganisms.</p>
