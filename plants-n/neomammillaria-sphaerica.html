                    <h1>Neomammillaria sphaerica</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria sphaerica, commonly known as the globular hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
