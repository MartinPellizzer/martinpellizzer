<p>It features striking, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that emerges in early spring. Its bulbs are perennial and produce offsets, allowing the plant to spread over time.</p>
<p>Nerine marginata is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
