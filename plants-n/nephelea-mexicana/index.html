                            <h1>Nephelea Mexicana</h1>
<p>Nephelea mexicana is a rare and fascinating plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and purple. This species thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in desert environments where water is scarce. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, Nephelea mexicana faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
