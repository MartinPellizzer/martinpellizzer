                    <h1>Nepeta orientalis</h1>
<p>Nepeta orientalis, commonly known as Persian catnip, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its essential oils, rich in nepetalactone, are responsible for its strong aromatic properties and mild sedative effects.</p>
<p>Nepeta orientalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
