<p>Neottia asiatica, commonly known as the Asian twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Neottia asiatica is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
