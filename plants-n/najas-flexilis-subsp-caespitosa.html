<p>Najas flexilis subsp.</p>
<p>caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters, which is reflected in its subspecies name "caespitosa.". It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
