<p>Nepenthes baramensis, commonly known as the Baram pitcher plant, is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, glandular surface on its leaves that enhances its ability to capture prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Nepenthes baramensis is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling within its native habitat.</p>
