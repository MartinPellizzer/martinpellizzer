<p>Najas marina, commonly known as water clover, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water surface. Najas marina plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from the water.</p>
