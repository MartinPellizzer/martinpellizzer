                    <h1>Nephrodium monticola</h1>
<p>Nephrodium monticola, commonly known as the mountain nephroid, is a rare fern species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium monticola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
