<p>Nymphoides thunbergiana, commonly known as the Japanese water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white to pink flowers that bloom in summer.
