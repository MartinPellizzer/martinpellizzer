The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It plays a unique role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
