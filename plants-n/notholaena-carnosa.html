                    <h1>Notholaena carnosa</h1>
<p>Notholaena carnosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Notholaena carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
