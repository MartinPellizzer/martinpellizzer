                    <h1>Neobrachyactis pubescens</h1>
<p>Neobrachyactis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy short-stemmed orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
