<p>Nanophyton iliense, commonly known as the Ili Valley moss, is a small, cryptogamic plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a leafy liverwort that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in rocky substrates. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow, often with a single layer of cells, and are adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Nanophyton iliense is typically found in the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Ili River valley in Kazakhstan.</p>
