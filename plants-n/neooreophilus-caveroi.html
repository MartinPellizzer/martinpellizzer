                    <h1>Neooreophilus caveroi</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus caveroi, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited to its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
