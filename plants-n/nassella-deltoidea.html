<p>Nassella deltoidea, commonly known as delta needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Nassella deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments.</p>
