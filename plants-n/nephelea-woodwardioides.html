                    <h1>Nephelea woodwardioides</h1>
<p>Nephelea woodwardioides, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
