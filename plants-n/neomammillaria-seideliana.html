                    <h1>Neomammillaria seideliana</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria seideliana, commonly known as the Seidel's pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
