                    <h1>Nepenthes ampullacea</h1>
<p>Nepenthes ampullacea, commonly known as the "bottle-shaped pitcher plant," is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, bottle-shaped pitchers that trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves form the upper part of the pitcher, while the lower portion is a narrow, tubular structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology allows it to efficiently capture prey in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
