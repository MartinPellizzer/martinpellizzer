                    <h1>Nephrodium leptophyllum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Its habitat is often moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
