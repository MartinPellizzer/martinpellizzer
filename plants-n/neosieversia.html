<p>Neosieversia, commonly known as the golden grass or golden beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in wetland or marshy environments. Neosieversia species are characterized by their tall, slender stems and dense clusters of golden-yellow to orange-red florets. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and the plants are typically perennial.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species.</p>
