<p>Nubelaria arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that form a compact rosette, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nubelaria arisanensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
