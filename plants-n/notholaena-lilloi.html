                    <h1>Notholaena lilloi</h1>
<p>Notholaena lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
