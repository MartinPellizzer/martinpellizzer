                    <h1>Nuxia involucrata f. brevibracteata</h1>
<p>Nuxia involucrata f. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bract nuxia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to store water and minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh, dry environments.</p>
