<p>Najas marina subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface during the summer months. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
