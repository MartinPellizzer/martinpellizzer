                    <h1>Nephrea</h1>
<p>Nephrea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly shapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its broad, ribbon-like leaves for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Nephrea is known for its ability to absorb pollutants from water, making it an important species in water purification.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
