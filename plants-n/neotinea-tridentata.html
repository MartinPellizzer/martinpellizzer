<p>Neotinea tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into three distinct lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neotinea tridentata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.</p>
