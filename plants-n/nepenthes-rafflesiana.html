                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana, commonly known as the giant pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form distinctive pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sweet nectar to lure insects, which then fall into the liquid-filled cavity. The plant is also notable for its ability to trap and digest small vertebrates such as rodents and birds.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
