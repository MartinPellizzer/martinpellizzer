<p>Nervilia gleadowii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Its intricate venation patterns and small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are key botanical features.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
