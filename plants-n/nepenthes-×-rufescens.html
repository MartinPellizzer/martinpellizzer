                    <h1>Nepenthes × rufescens</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × rufescens, commonly known as the red-tailed pitcher plant, is a hybrid species within the genus Nepenthes, native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red colored pitchers, which are often adorned with a yellowish rim. The plant produces a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes ventrata, resulting in a highly adaptable and visually striking carnivorous plant. Its pitchers secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This hybrid is popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
