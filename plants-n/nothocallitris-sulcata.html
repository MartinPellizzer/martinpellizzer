                    <h1>Nothocallitris sulcata</h1>
<p>Nothocallitris sulcata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and fibrous, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Nothocallitris sulcata is also valued for its resilience to drought and salt spray, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
