                    <h1>Nephrodium serrulatum var. paucipinnatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium serrulatum var. paucipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely serrated fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its reduced pinnation, which distinguishes it from other members of the Nephrodium genus.</p>
