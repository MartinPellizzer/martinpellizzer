                <h1>Neottia longicaulis</h1>
<p>Neottia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack a distinct scent, which is characteristic of many orchids in the genus Neottia.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
