<p>Nephrolepis wallichiana, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, with the sterile fronds typically appearing first, followed by the spore-bearing fertile fronds.</p>
