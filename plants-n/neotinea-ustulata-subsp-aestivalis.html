<p>Neotinea ustulata subsp.</p>
<p>aestivalis, commonly known as the spring marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>The subspecies aestivalis is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other subspecies of Neotinea ustulata.</p>
