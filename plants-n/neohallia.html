                    <h1>Neohallia</h1>
<p>Neohallia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiky flower heads and salt-tolerant properties, making them adapted to coastal environments. Neohallia species typically have silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid or saline conditions. They produce small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The genus is native to various regions around the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
