                    <h1>Nephrodium pubescens var. breviculum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium pubescens var. breviculum, commonly known as the short-stemmed nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, lanceolate fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
