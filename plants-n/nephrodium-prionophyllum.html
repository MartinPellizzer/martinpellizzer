                    <h1>Nephrodium prionophyllum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium prionophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its habitat is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
