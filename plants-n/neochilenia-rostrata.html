                    <h1>Neochilenia rostrata</h1>
<p>Neochilenia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flattened layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture and distinct isidiate and rhizinate structures. It thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, often found in deserts or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential role in soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
