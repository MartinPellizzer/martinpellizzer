                    <h1>Necepsia</h1>
<p>Necepsia, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, and is native to North America. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a cup-like structure, which aids in their dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Necepsia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
