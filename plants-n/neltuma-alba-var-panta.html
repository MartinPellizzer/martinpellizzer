                    <h1>Neltuma alba var. panta</h1>
<p>Neltuma alba var. panta, commonly known as the White Cloud Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, often described as resembling clouds. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers, when they appear, are small and white, adding to its ethereal beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
