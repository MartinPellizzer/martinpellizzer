                    <h1>Noaea minuta</h1>
<p>Noaea minuta, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a hardy species for harsh climates. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in excreting excess sodium.</p>
<p>Noaea minuta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
