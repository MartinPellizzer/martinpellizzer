                    <h1>Nepenthes orbiculata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes orbiculata, commonly known as the broad-leafed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, orbicular-shaped pitchers that can hold up to 500 milliliters of liquid. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey. Its habitat typically includes shaded, humid environments with nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Nepenthes orbiculata is notable for its ability to capture both insects and small vertebrates, making it an effective predator in its ecosystem.</p>
