                    <h1>Neesia</h1>
<p>Neesia, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Neesia species are characterized by their thick, often woody stems that store water, making them drought-resistant. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red.</p>
<p>Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
