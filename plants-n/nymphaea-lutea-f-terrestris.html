<p>Nymphaea lutea f. terrestris, commonly known as the yellow water lily variant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in sunny conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water, while its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon.</p>
