<p>Neoregelia tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark neoregelia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Neoregelia tenebrosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
