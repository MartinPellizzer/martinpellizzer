<p>Nephelaphyllum grandiflorum, commonly known as the cloudflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a ethereal appearance. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
