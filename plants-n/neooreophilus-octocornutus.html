<p>Neooreophilus octocornutus, commonly known as the eight-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring eight prominent, elongated nectar-producing structures that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
