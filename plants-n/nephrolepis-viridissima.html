                    <h1>Nephrolepis viridissima</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis viridissima, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features long, arching fronds that are divided into narrow, glossy green segments, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent in some varieties, though this trait is more pronounced in certain cultivars.</p>
