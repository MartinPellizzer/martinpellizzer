                    <h1>Neoscortechinia nicobarica</h1>
<p>Neoscortechinia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small, clustered inflorescences and specialized root system are adaptations to its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
