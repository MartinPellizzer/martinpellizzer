                    <h1>Nephrodium hederifolium</h1>
<p>Nephrodium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that produces numerous upright, arching fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture and a dark green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to form dense colonies makes it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats.</p>
