                    <h1>Nassella melanocarpa</h1>
<p>Nassella melanocarpa, commonly known as black needle grass, is a perennial grass native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark-colored stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Black needle grass is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
