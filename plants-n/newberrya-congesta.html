                    <h1>Newberrya congesta</h1>
<p>Newberrya congesta, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Newberrya congesta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
