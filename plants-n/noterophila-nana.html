                    <h1>Noterophila nana</h1>
<p>Noterophila nana, commonly known as the dwarf noterophila, is a small, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its frost-prone habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Noterophila nana plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
