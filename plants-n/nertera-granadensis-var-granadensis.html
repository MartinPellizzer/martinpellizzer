                    <h1>Nertera granadensis var. granadensis</h1>
<p>Nertera granadensis var. granadensis, commonly known as the Emerald Necklace, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are a striking bright green, often with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
