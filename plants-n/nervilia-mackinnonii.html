                    <h1>Nervilia mackinnonii</h1>
<p>Nervilia mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fern family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble those of a true fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia mackinnonii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
