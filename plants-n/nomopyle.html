<p>Nomopyle, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
