                    <h1>Notodanthonia alpicola</h1>
<p>Notodanthonia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine danthonia, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
