<p>Noccaea caerulescens subsp.</p>
<p>virens, commonly known as the green alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bright green leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
