                    <h1>Neuroplatyceros alcicornis</h1>
<p>Neuroplatyceros alcicornis, commonly known as the slender torch orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, with distinctive, elongated sepals and petals. Its growth is slow and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
