                    <h1>Neomoorea irrorata</h1>
<p>Neomoorea irrorata, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neomoorea irrorata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
