<p>Nopal, commonly known as prickly pear cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are often covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Nopal is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine and cuisine across various cultures.</p>
