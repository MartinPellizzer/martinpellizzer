                    <h1>Nototriche aristata</h1>
<p>Nototriche aristata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Nototriche aristata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to harsh mountain conditions.</p>
