<p>Nocca heteropappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures that aid in its spread across dry landscapes. Nocca heteropappus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
