                    <h1>Neomangenotia</h1>
<p>Neomangenotia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Neomangenotia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
