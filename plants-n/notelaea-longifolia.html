                    <h1>Notelaea longifolia</h1>
<p>Notelaea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved notelaea, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its slender, evergreen shrub form with elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various native insects and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Notelaea longifolia is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
