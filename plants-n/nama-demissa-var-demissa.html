<p>Nama demissa var. demissa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
