                    <h1>Nasturtium dictyospermum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium dictyospermum, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the true nasturtiums. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. It contains compounds such as mucilage and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that some species within the genus may contain toxic compounds, so caution is advised when handling or consuming it.</p>
