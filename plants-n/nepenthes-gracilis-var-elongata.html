                    <h1>Nepenthes gracilis var. elongata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes gracilis var. elongata, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitchers that are typically green with red or orange highlights. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then become trapped in the pitcher's digestive fluid. Its leaves are long and narrow, often curling into a spiral to form the distinctive pitcher structure.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly noted for its adaptability to shaded environments and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
