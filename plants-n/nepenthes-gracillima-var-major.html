                    <h1>Nepenthes gracillima var. major</h1>
<p>Nepenthes gracillima var. major, commonly known as the giant slender pitcher plant, is a remarkable carnivorous plant native to the highland regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form strikingly large, elongated pitcher structures. These pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
