                    <h1>Nengella incompta</h1>
<p>Nengella incompta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and specialized pollination mechanisms make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nengella incompta is considered critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
