                    <h1>Natrix rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Natrix rotundifolia, commonly known as the smooth water snake, is a species of aquatic snake found in freshwater habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It has a slender body with a distinctive smooth, glossy scale pattern that helps it blend into its environment. The plant associated with this snake, though not a plant itself, is often found in the same wetland areas where the snake resides. Natrix rotundifolia is not a plant, so it does not have botanical characteristics.</p>
