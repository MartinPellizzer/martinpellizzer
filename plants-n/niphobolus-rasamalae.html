                    <h1>Niphobolus rasamalae</h1>
<p>Niphobolus rasamalae, commonly known as the Malawi moonlight lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Malawi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its unique flowering pattern and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Niphobolus rasamalae is also notable for its role in local folklore and its potential medicinal uses.</p>
