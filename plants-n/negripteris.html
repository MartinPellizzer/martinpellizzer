                    <h1>Negripteris</h1>
<p>Negripteris, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a genus of fossil plants that dates back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their complex fronds and spore-producing structures, indicating a sophisticated reproductive system. Negripteris fossils are often found in coal-bearing strata, suggesting they thrived in swampy, tropical environments. The genus is significant in paleobotany for its role in understanding early plant evolution and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its morphology provides insights into the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life.</p>
