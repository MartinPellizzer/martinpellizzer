                    <h1>Neocaldasia</h1>
<p>Neocaldasia, commonly known as the neocaldasia orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. They are characterized by their epiphytic growth habit, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Neocaldasia species typically have showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological role within their native habitats.</p>
