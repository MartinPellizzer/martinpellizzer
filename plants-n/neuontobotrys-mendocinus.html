                    <h1>Neuontobotrys mendocinus</h1>
<p>Neuontobotrys mendocinus, commonly known as the Mendocino ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the foggy coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ghostly in the dim light of its habitat. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom during the late summer months. Its unique morphology and limited geographic range make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
