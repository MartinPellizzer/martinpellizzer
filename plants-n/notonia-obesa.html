<p>Notonia obesa, commonly known as the fat plant or globose euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its unique, swollen appearance gives it a distinctive, almost cartoonish look.</p>
<p>Notonia obesa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
