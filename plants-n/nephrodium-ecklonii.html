<p>Nephrodium ecklonii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Nephrodium ecklonii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
