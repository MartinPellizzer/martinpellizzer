<p>Notopleura epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, often clustered stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Notopleura epiphytica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
