                    <h1>Nasonia robusta</h1>
<p>Nasonia robusta, commonly known as the robusta wasp, is a small parasitic wasp species belonging to the family Pteromalidae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it primarily parasitizes the larvae of various flies, including those of the family Tephritidae. The adult wasp has a distinctive black body with yellow markings, and its life cycle is closely tied to the host insect's development. Nasonia robusta plays a significant role in natural pest control by regulating fly populations.</p>
<p>Its study is also valuable in evolutionary biology due to its short life cycle and genetic tractability.</p>
