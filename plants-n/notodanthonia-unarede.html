<p>Notodanthonia unarede, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or reddish in color. It is well-suited for stabilizing dunes and is often found in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in revegetation projects in sandy environments.</p>
