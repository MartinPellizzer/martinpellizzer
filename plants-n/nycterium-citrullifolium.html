                    <h1>Nycterium citrullifolium</h1>
<p>Nycterium citrullifolium, commonly known as the citrullifolium nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that resemble the leaves of the cucumber plant, hence its specific epithet. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
