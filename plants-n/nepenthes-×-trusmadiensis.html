                    <h1>Nepenthes × trusmadiensis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × trusmadiensis, commonly known as the Titiwangsa hybrid, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes lowii and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapting to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat.</p>
<p>This hybrid is notable for its ecological significance and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and biological interest.</p>
