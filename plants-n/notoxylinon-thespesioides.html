                    <h1>Notoxylinon thespesioides</h1>
<p>Notoxylinon thespesioides, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique root system consisting of pneumatophores, which protrude above the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits a high tolerance to salt and can thrive in brackish and saline environments. Its leaves are alternate and oblong, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The red mangrove plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
