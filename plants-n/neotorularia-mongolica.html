<p>Neotorularia mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming moss-like plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a compact structure with closely appressed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white or yellowish rhizoids. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Neotorularia mongolica plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for arid ecosystems.</p>
