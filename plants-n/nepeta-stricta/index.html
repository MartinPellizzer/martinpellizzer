                            <h1>Nepeta Stricta</h1>
<p>Catnip, scientifically known as Nepeta stricta, is a hardy perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is widely recognized for its distinctive scent and its ability to enthrall both humans and animals, particularly cats. The plant features slender stems and small, opposite leaves that emit a minty aroma when crushed. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters of pink to white, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its popularity, catnip remains a versatile plant with uses in herbal medicine and as a garden ornamental.</p>
