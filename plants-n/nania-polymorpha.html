                    <h1>Nania polymorpha</h1>
<p>Nania polymorpha, commonly known as the variable nania, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant produces inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Nania polymorpha thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
