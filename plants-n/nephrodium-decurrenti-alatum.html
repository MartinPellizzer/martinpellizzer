                    <h1>Nephrodium decurrenti-alatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium decurrenti-alatum, commonly known as the spreading kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, kidney-shaped fronds that often have a wavy or undulating margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, contributing to its spread and establishment in suitable habitats.</p>
