                    <h1>Nephrolepis tuberosa var. undulata</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis tuberosa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
