                    <h1>Neoporteria vallenarensis var. atroviridis</h1>
<p>Neoporteria vallenarensis var. atroviridis, commonly known as the Atrovirid neoporteria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal climate with high salinity and strong winds. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
