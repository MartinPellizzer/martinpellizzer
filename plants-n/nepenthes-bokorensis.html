<p>Nepenthes bokorensis, commonly known as the Bokorensis Pitcher Plant, is a tropical pitcher plant native to the rainforests of Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often reddish-colored pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant produces a sweet-smelling nectar to attract prey, which then slips into the digestive fluid at the base of the pitcher. Its habitat is typically in shaded, humid environments with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Nepenthes bokorensis is a rare species, highlighting the biodiversity of Southeast Asian flora.</p>
