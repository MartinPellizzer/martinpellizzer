                    <h1>Nervilia perrieri</h1>
<p>Nervilia perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus Nervilia. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its small, spore-bearing sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nervilia perrieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
