                    <h1>Nepenthes garrawayae</h1>
<p>Nepenthes garrawayae, commonly known as the Garraway's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
