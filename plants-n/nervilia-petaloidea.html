                    <h1>Nervilia petaloidea</h1>
<p>Nervilia petaloidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale green flowers that resemble petals, giving it its common name. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
