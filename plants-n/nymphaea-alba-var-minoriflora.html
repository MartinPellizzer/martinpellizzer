                    <h1>Nymphaea alba var. minoriflora</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alba var. minoriflora, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, floating leaves and produces delicate white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems support the foliage.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
