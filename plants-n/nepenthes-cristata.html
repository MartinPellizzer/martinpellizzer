                    <h1>Nepenthes cristata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes cristata, commonly known as the cristate pitcher plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, wavy-ridged pitchers that are often adorned with a distinctive crest-like structure. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its leaves are modified into specialized traps, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Nepenthes cristata is a popular subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its fascinating morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
