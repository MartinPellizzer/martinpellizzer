<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
