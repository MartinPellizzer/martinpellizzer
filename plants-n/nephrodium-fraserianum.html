<p>Nephrodium fraserianum, commonly known as the Fraser's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green and have a soft texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
