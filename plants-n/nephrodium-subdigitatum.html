                    <h1>Nephrodium subdigitatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium subdigitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a split finger. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing cones called soruses, which are clustered along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium subdigitatum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
