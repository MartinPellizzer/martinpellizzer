                    <h1>Neomammillaria klissingiana</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria klissingiana, commonly known as the Klissing's milk barrel cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, ribbed stem with prominent areoles and short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often borne on a short stem above the main body. Its dense, woolly coating helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
