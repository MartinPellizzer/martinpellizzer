                    <h1>Noccaea speluncarum</h1>
<p>Noccaea speluncarum, commonly known as the cave kidneyweed, is a rare and elusive plant species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and pale green or almost white flowers, which are often hidden from direct sunlight. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor substrates. Its survival depends on specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Noccaea speluncarum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
