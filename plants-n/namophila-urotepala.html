<p>Namophila urotepala, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
