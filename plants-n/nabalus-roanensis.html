<p>Nabalus roanensis, commonly known as the Roan mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Roan Highlands in Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Nabalus roanensis is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous environment.</p>
