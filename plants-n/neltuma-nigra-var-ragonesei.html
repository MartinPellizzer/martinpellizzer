                    <h1>Neltuma nigra var. ragonesei</h1>
<p>Neltuma nigra var. ragonesei, commonly known as the Ragonese's black neltuma, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
