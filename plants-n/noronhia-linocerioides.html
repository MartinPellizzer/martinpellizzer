<p>Noronhia linocerioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain.

Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators, while its fruits are small drupes containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Noronhia linocerioides is now considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
