                    <h1>Neotinea commutata var. angelica</h1>
<p>Neotinea commutata var. angelica, commonly known as the angelica fern, is a rare and striking variety of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
