                    <h1>Nepenthes brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Nepenthes brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-stemmed pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the lowland forests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped traps, which are filled with digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are modified into elongated, spiraling structures that form the distinctive pitcher shapes. Unlike many other Nepenthes species, N. brachycarpa has a shorter stem and smaller, more compact pitchers.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
