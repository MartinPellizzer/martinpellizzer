<p>Neurogramma delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neurogramma delavayi plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life.</p>
