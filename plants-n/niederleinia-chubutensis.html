                    <h1>Niederleinia chubutensis</h1>
<p>Niederleinia chubutensis, commonly known as the Chubut lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus with a distinct, often bright green to yellowish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It is endemic to the Patagonian region of Argentina, where it grows on rock surfaces and soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
