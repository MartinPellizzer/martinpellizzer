                    <h1>Nephrodium microsorum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium microsorum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
