<p>Neottia meifongensis, commonly known as the Meifong orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, tubular leaves are adapted to conserve water in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
