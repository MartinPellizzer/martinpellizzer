<p>Nephrodium blanfordii, commonly known as the Blanford's nephroid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium blanfordii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
