<p>Neoachmandra nesophila, commonly known as the alpine neoachmandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
