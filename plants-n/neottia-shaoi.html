                    <h1>Neottia shaoi</h1>
<p>Neottia shaoi, commonly known as the Shaoi's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, delicate leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence with several flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Neottia shaoi is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
