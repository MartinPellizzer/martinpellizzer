                    <h1>Nosema prunelloides</h1>
<p>Nosema prunelloides, commonly known as the common fig wasp, is a parasitic wasp species that plays a crucial role in the pollination of fig trees.</p>
<p>It is a small insect, typically measuring between 5 to 7 millimeters in length, with a slender body and transparent wings. The wasp lays its eggs inside the fig's flowers, where the developing larvae feed on the developing seeds. This interaction is mutualistic, as the wasp's life cycle is closely tied to the fig's reproductive process.</p>
<p>The species is widely distributed in regions where fig trees are cultivated, contributing to the ecological and agricultural significance of these plants.</p>
