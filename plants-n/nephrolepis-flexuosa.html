                    <h1>Nephrolepis flexuosa</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis flexuosa, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Nephrolepis flexuosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties.</p>
