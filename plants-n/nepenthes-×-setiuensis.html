<p>Nepenthes × setiuensis, commonly known as the Setiu hybrid, is a tropical pitcher plant native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Nepenthes rajah and Nepenthes lowii, exhibiting a combination of traits from both parent species. The plant produces large, striking pitcher structures that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to trap moisture in the humid rainforest environment.</p>
<p>The pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and contain a digestive fluid that helps the plant obtain nutrients from captured insects.</p>
