                    <h1>Notocactus pseudopulvinatus</h1>
<p>Notocactus pseudopulvinatus, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble beans, which are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by green, bean-like fruits that mature into a hard, brown shell. Inside the shell, a larva of the moth *Lasioderma mexicanum* develops, which is responsible for the plant's distinctive "jumping" behavior.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a fascinating example of a plant-moth symbiotic relationship.</p>
