<p>Neotorularia dentata, commonly known as the toothed stromboid, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Strombidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is often covered in a thick, calcareous layer. The shell typically features distinct ridges and a pronounced siphonal canal, which aids in respiration and sensing the environment. The species is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula.</p>
