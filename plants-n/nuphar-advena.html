<p>Nuphar advena, commonly known as the European yellow water-lily, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Nuphar advena plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
