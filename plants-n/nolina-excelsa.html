                    <h1>Nolina excelsa</h1>
<p>Nolina excelsa, commonly known as the silver grass tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem with a dense crown of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often described as resembling grass blades. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates.</p>
