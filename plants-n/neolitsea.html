<p>Neolitsea, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or sweet-smelling privet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It comprises approximately 100 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and the Philippines. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often aromatic, with a glossy surface and a lanceolate or ovate shape. Neolitsea species produce small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by berries that are usually dark purple or black when mature.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are often used in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
