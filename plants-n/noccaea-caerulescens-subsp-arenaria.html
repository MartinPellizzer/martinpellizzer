<p>Noccaea caerulescens subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the sand avens, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. It has a compact root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
