                    <h1>Nepenthes hurrelliana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes hurrelliana, commonly known as the Hurrell's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, urn-shaped pitcher traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and spiral around supporting structures, aiding in its climbing growth habit. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a spike, and it is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils, relying heavily on insect prey for sustenance.</p>
