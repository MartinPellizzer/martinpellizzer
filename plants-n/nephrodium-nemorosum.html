                    <h1>Nephrodium nemorosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium nemorosum, commonly known as the forest spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with a central stem and lateral branches that bear leaves arranged in two rows. The leaves are typically elongated and have a slightly curled margin, which helps in water retention. It produces spore capsules that are clustered at the base of the plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in forest floors, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
