<p>Neomammillaria subangularis var. longiseta, commonly known as the Long-haired Angular Milkweed Cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, angular ribs that are often covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its varietal name, *longiseta*, refers to the long, slender spines that distinguish it from other varieties.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires full sun and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
