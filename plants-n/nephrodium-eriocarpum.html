                    <h1>Nephrodium eriocarpum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly kidney fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces dense, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that contribute to its overall compact structure. Nephrodium eriocarpum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
