                    <h1>Neoburttia</h1>
<p>Neoburttia, commonly known as the burttia or false burrweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Neoburttia species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and hairy leaves, which help them conserve water in harsh climates. They typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often forming dense colonies in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The genus is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect and bird populations.</p>
