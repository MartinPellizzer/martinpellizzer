                    <h1>Nervilia erosa</h1>
<p>Nervilia erosa, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears a dense spike of pink or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the damp, shaded environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Nervilia erosa is often found in woodlands, rocky areas, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
