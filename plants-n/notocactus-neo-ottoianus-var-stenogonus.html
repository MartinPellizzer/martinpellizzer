<p>Notocactus neo-ottoianus var. stenogonus, commonly known as the Stenogonus notocactus, is a rare and unusual cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It requires minimal water and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for desert gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation.</p>
