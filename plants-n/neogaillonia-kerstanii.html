                    <h1>Neogaillonia kerstanii</h1>
<p>Neogaillonia kerstanii, commonly known as the Kerstan's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neogaillonia kerstanii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
