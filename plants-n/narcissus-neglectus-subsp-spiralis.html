<p>Narcissus neglectus subsp.</p>
<p>spiralis, commonly known as the spiral daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its unique, twisted floral structure, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in woodland areas and is found in parts of southern Europe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are yellow with a prominent, spiral-like corona.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution.</p>
