                    <h1>Nuphar americana</h1>
<p>Nuphar americana, commonly known as the American water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Nuphar americana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
