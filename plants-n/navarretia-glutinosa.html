<p>Navarretia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky navarretia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its sticky leaves and stems are adaptations that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Navarretia glutinosa is also known for its ability to bloom in response to seasonal rainfall, making it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
