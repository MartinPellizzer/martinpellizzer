                    <h1>Neoholubia pubescens var. alpina</h1>
<p>Neoholubia pubescens var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine neoholubia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and distinctive floral structures. This variant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
