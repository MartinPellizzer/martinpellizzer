<p>Najas arguta var. tenera, commonly known as the slender water nymph, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge just above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in ponds and lakes, often forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous fish.</p>
