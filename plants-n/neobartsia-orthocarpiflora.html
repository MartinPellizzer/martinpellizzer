                    <h1>Neobartsia orthocarpiflora</h1>
<p>Neobartsia orthocarpiflora, commonly known as the straight-fruit bartsia, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are opposite and often have a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
