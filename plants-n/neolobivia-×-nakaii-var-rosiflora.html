<p>Neolobivia × nakaii var. rosiflora, commonly known as the Rosy-flowered Lobivia, is a hybrid cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its greenish-gray stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it may exhibit a wide range of morphological variations in different growing conditions.</p>
