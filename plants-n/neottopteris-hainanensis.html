                    <h1>Neottopteris hainanensis</h1>
<p>Neottopteris hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan shield fern, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Neottopteris hainanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
