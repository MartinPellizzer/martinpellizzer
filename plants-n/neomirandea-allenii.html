                    <h1>Neomirandea allenii</h1>
<p>Neomirandea allenii, commonly known as the Allen's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida, where it thrives in wetland habitats. This plant is notable for its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble spectral forms. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Neomirandea allenii is considered critically endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
