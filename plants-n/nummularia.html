<p>Nummularia, commonly known as silver carpet or pennywort, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage composed of round, silver-gray leaves that are slightly curled under the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade.</p>
