                    <h1>Nephrodium sangnellii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sangnellii, commonly known as the Sangnellis' kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium sangnellii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
