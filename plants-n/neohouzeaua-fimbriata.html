                    <h1>Neohouzeaua fimbriata</h1>
<p>Neohouzeaua fimbriata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a unique member of the Hymenophyllum family, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's fronds are typically long and narrow, with a feathery appearance that gives it a lace-like texture. It has small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neohouzeaua fimbriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
