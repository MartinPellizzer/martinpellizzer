                    <h1>Newcastelia spodiotricha</h1>
<p>Newcastelia spodiotricha, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and rimu, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Newcastelia spodiotricha plays a unique role in New Zealand's ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host species and wildlife.</p>
