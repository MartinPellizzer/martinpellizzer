<p>Nassella macrathera, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and spikelike inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
