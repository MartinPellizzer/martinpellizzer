                    <h1>Neonauclea formicaria</h1>
<p>Neonauclea formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique ability to secrete nectar, which attracts ants to its foliage. The plant's leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Neonauclea formicaria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its relationship with ants is mutualistic, as the ants protect the plant from herbivores in exchange for food.</p>
