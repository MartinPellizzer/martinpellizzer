                    <h1>Notylia barkeri</h1>
<p>Notylia barkeri, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which reduces water loss in the salty environment.</p>
<p>Notylia barkeri plays a crucial role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
