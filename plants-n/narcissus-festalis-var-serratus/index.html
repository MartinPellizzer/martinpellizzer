                            <h1>Narcissus Festalis Var. Serratus</h1>
<p>Serrated daffodil, scientifically known as Narcissus festalis var. serratus, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers with a bright yellow hue. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The serrated edges of its leaves give it its common name, adding to its visual appeal. With its elegant appearance and hardy nature, the serrated daffodil is both a garden favorite and a symbol of spring renewal.</p>
