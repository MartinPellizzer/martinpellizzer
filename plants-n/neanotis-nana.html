                    <h1>Neanotis nana</h1>
<p>Neanotis nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with a mat-forming growth habit that allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of frost or snow during the winter months.</p>
<p>Neanotis nana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for specialized pollinators and contributing to soil stability in tundra environments.</p>
