<p>Notholaena micropteris, commonly known as the narrow-winged fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Notholaena micropteris thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
