                    <h1>Neoporteria iquiquensis</h1>
<p>Neoporteria iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique neoporteria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Neoporteria iquiquensis is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, making it a unique example of botanical resilience.</p>
