                    <h1>Nephrodium attenuatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium attenuatum, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a narrow, attenuated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
