                    <h1>Neltuma laevigata</h1>
<p>Neltuma laevigata, commonly known as the smooth neltuma, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma laevigata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
