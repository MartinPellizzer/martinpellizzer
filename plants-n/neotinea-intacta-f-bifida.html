                    <h1>Neotinea intacta f. bifida</h1>
<p>Neotinea intacta f. bifida, commonly known as the bifid orchid, is a unique variant of the Neotinea intacta species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) petals, which set it apart from other members of the genus. This orchid is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include slender stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring season.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
