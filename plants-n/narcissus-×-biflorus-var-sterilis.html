                    <h1>Narcissus × biflorus var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Narcissus × biflorus var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile daffodil, is a naturally occurring variant of the daffodil species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced fertility, as it produces no viable seeds due to genetic sterility. The plant typically exhibits the typical daffodil structure, with a single, showy, trumpet-shaped corona and six to eight petals. It is often found in the wild in regions where its parent species are native.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic traits and potential for hybridization.</p>
