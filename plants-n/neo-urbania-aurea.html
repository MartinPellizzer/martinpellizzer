<p>Neo-urbania aurea, commonly known as the golden city plant, is a unique species characterized by its striking golden foliage and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>It thrives in urban environments, adapting well to high levels of pollution and limited soil nutrients. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
