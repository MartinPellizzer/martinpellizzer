                    <h1>Nepenthes sandakanensis var. eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Nepenthes sandakanensis var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the Bornean glandless pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and its pitchers often have a reddish or orange hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its lack of glandular hairs on the pitcher surface, distinguishing it from other Nepenthes species.</p>
