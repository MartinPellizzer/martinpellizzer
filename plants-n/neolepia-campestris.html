<p>Neolepia campestris, commonly known as the field fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Neolepia campestris has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
