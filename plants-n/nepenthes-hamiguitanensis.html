<p>Nepenthes hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan Pitcher Plant, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, modified leaves that form striking pitcher-shaped structures used to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy surface that enhances their attractiveness to prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the montane forests of the Hamiguitan Range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
