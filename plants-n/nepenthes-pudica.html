                    <h1>Nepenthes pudica</h1>
<p>Nepenthes pudica, commonly known as the shy pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically hidden within the foliage, making it less conspicuous than other Nepenthes species. Its pitchers are usually green or reddish in color and contain a digestive fluid.</p>
<p>Nepenthes pudica thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
