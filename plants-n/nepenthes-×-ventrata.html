                    <h1>Nepenthes × ventrata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × ventrata, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant resulting from the cross between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, vibrant red or orange-colored pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with high light exposure, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its pitchers vary in size and color depending on environmental conditions and genetic factors.</p>
<p>Nepenthes × ventrata is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its ecological role in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
