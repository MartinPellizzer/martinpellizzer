<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Nuxia tomentella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
