                    <h1>Neoporteria napina var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Neoporteria napina var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny marsh hibiscus, is a variant of the marsh hibiscus native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny calyces, which give it its common name, and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
