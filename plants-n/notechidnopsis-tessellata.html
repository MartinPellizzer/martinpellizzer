                    <h1>Notechidnopsis tessellata</h1>
<p>Notechidnopsis tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Notechidnopsis tessellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
