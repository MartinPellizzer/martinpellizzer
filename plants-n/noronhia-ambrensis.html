<p>Noronhia ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Noronhia ambrensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
