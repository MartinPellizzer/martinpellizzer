<p>Narvalina corazonensis, commonly known as the Heartland fern, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, round seeds. Narvalina corazonensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
