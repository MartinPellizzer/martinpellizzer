<p>Nephrodium blumei, commonly known as the Blume's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
