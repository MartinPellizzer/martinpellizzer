                    <h1>Nepenthes albomarginata var. typica</h1>
<p>Nepenthes albomarginata var. typica, commonly known as the white-margin pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and elongated, tubular pitchers that are typically green with distinctive white margins. The plant produces nectar to attract insects, which then fall into the pitcher and are digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. Its pitchers are often adorned with fine hairs and a waxy coating that aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique carnivorous adaptations.</p>
