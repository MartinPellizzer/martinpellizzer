                    <h1>Nuphar rivularis</h1>
<p>Nuphar rivularis, commonly known as the river water plant, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its rhizomes grow underwater, allowing it to spread vegetatively through rhizome fragmentation.</p>
<p>Nuphar rivularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
