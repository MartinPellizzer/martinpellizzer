                    <h1>Nephrodium sparsum var. nitidulum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sparsum var. nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy nephroid, is a rare fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often glossy fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
