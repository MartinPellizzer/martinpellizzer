                    <h1>Nymphaea alba var. rubra</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alba var. rubra, commonly known as the red water lily, is a variant of the white water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface, contrasting with its broad, heart-shaped green leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically floating, while its roots are anchored in the substrate.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
