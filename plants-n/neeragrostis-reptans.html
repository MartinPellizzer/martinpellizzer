                    <h1>Neeragrostis reptans</h1>
<p>Neeragrostis reptans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
