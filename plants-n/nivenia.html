                    <h1>Nivenia</h1>
<p>Nivenia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and green. Nivenia species are typically small, herbaceous plants with tuberous roots that help them survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in their native habitats.</p>
