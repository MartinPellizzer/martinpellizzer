                    <h1>Nasturtiolum castratum</h1>
<p>Nasturtiolum castratum, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments and has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are often submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Nasturtiolum castratum is also valued as a food source for aquatic animals and can contribute to water quality by absorbing excess nutrients.</p>
