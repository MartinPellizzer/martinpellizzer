                    <h1>Nephrodium marginale var. traillae</h1>
<p>Nephrodium marginale var. traillae, commonly known as the Traill's nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that exhibit a distinctive marginal vein pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species.</p>
