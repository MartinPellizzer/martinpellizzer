<p>Nesogordonia macrophylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests and savanna woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture.</p>
