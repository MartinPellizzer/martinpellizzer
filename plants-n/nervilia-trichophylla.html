                    <h1>Nervilia trichophylla</h1>
<p>Nervilia trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy nerve plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves, from which it gets its common name, is a distinguishing feature of this species.</p>
