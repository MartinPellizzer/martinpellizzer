                    <h1>Nepenthes lanata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes lanata, commonly known as the woolly pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down prey. These traps are adapted to capture insects and small animals, providing the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Nepenthes lanata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests.</p>
