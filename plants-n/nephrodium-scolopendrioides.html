                    <h1>Nephrodium scolopendrioides</h1>
<p>Nephrodium scolopendrioides, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
