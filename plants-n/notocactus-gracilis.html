<p>Notocactus gracilis, commonly known as the slender notocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that grows upright, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Notocactus gracilis is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
