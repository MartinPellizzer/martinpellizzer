                    <h1>Nelumbo nelumbo</h1>
<p>Nelumbo nelumbo, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, while its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom. Its flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The lotus is also notable for its ability to produce clean, potable water through its root system.</p>
