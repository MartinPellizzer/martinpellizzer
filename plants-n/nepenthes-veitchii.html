<p>Nepenthes veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its pitchers can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, making it one of the largest in the Nepenthes genus.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of light and moisture for optimal growth.</p>
