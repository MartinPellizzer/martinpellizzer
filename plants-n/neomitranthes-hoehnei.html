                    <h1>Neomitranthes hoehnei</h1>
<p>Neomitranthes hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through specialized roots.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters on its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat.</p>
