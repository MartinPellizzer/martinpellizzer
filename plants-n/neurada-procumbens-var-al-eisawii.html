                    <h1>Neurada procumbens var. al-eisawii</h1>
<p>Neurada procumbens var. al-eisawii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling stem system that hugs the ground, with small, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules that disperse its seeds via the wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its resilience to desert conditions, making it a characteristic example of xerophytic flora.</p>
