                    <h1>Neogossypium</h1>
<p>Neogossypium, commonly known as wild cotton, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their fluffy, cotton-like fibers that develop around the seeds. Neogossypium species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and alternate leaves. The flowers are usually pink or purple, and they produce capsule fruits that contain the fibrous seed hairs.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest to botanists and textile researchers due to its potential for developing new cotton varieties with improved traits.</p>
