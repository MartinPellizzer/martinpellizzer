<p>Nageia vieillardii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
