                    <h1>Namation glandulosum</h1>
<p>Namation glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular namation, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves are a key botanical feature that distinguishes it from related species.</p>
