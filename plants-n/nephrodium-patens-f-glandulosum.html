                    <h1>Nephrodium patens f. glandulosum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium patens f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular nephroid, is a variant of the nephroid plant characterized by its distinctive glandular features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and small, clustered glands along the leaf margins. Its growth habit is usually erect, with a compact form that allows it to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The glandular structures are thought to play a role in water retention and defense against herbivores.</p>
