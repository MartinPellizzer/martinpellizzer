                    <h1>Nepenthes glandulifera</h1>
<p>Nepenthes glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitfall traps to capture prey. The plant's pitchers are often filled with a digestive fluid that helps break down insects and other small animals. Its glandular structures along the pitcher's surface secrete enzymes and attract prey with a sweet-smelling nectar.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
