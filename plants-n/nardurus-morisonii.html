                    <h1>Nardurus morisonii</h1>
<p>Nardurus morisonii, commonly known as the Morison's nardus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nardurus morisonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
