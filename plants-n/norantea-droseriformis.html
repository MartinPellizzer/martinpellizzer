                    <h1>Norantea droseriformis</h1>
<p>Norantea droseriformis, commonly known as the dewy fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>Its foliage is covered in fine, hair-like structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects, a feature typical of carnivorous plants. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in shaded, humid areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil nutrient cycling.</p>
