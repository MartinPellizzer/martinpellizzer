                    <h1>Nogra grahamii</h1>
<p>Nogra grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal dunes of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nogra grahamii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
