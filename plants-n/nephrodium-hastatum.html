                    <h1>Nephrodium hastatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium hastatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
