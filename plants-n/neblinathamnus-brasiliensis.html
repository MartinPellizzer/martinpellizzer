<p>Neblinathamnus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mist fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Neblinathamnus brasiliensis is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
