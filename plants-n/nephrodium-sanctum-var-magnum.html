<p>Nephrodium sanctum var. magnum, commonly known as the sacred heart fern, is a rare and ornamental fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features lush, dark green fronds that are deeply lobed and arranged in a distinctive, graceful pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
