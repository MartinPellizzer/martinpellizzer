<p>Nidorella resedifolia subsp.</p>
<p>frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often attaching itself to the roots of grasses or shrubs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
