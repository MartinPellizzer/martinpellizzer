<p>Neowashingtonia robusta, commonly known as the desert fan palm, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deep underground. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neowashingtonia robusta is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
