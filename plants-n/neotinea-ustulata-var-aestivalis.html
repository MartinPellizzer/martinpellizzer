                    <h1>Neotinea ustulata var. aestivalis</h1>
<p>Neotinea ustulata var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe.</p>
<p>It produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or folded. It blooms in early summer, typically from June to July, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other Neotinea species.</p>
