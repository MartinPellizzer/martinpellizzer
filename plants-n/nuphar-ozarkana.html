<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in buoyancy and reducing water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, producing small, edible seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
