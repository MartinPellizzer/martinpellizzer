                    <h1>Nageia hallii</h1>
<p>Nageia hallii, commonly known as the Hall's nageia, is a rare conifer native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals around the stems. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nageia hallii is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>
