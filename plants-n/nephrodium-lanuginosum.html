<p>Nephrodium lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly nephrolepis, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, branched fronds with lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium lanuginosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
