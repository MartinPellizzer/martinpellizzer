The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
