                    <h1>Nicotiana ameghinoi</h1>
<p>Nicotiana ameghinoi, commonly known as the Ameghino's tobacco, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for its nicotine content like other Nicotiana species, it holds ecological and botanical significance in its native range.</p>
