                    <h1>Neoregelia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Neoregelia stolonifera, commonly known as the spider plant or stoloniferous neoregelia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Neoregelia stolonifera is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can also propagate through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root and form new plants.</p>
