<p>Nymphaea odorata var. rosacea, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a water-living plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. Its roots are submerged in the mud, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
