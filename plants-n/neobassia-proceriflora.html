<p>Neobassia proceriflora, commonly known as the slender-leafed bassia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Neobassia proceriflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
