                    <h1>Nervilia cumberlegii</h1>
<p>Nervilia cumberlegii, commonly known as the Cumberlegii fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only a fiddlehead and the second year bearing spore-bearing leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Nervilia cumberlegii is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
