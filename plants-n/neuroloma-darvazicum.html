                    <h1>Neuroloma darvazicum</h1>
<p>Neuroloma darvazicum, commonly known as the Darvazian neuroflora, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the late summer months, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its root system is highly specialized, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neuroloma darvazicum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
