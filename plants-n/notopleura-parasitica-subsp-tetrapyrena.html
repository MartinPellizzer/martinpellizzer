<p>Notopleura parasitica subsp.</p>
<p>tetrapyrena, commonly known as the four-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its four-lobed leaf structure, which distinguishes it from other members of the Notopleura genus.</p>
