                    <h1>Neoabbottia quadricostata</h1>
<p>Neoabbottia quadricostata, commonly known as the four-ribbed neoabbottia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, with a unique structure that includes four prominent floral ribs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
