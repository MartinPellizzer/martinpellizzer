                    <h1>Nicipe perparva</h1>
<p>Nicipe perparva, commonly known as the dwarf nitch plant, is a small herbaceous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil.</p>
<p>Nicipe perparva is often cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
