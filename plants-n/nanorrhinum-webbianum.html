<p>Nanorrhinum webbianum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Nanorrhinum webbianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
