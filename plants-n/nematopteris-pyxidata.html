<p>Nematopteris pyxidata, commonly known as the common water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four to six segments, resembling a clover leaf. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is often found in shallow, sunlit waters. Nematopteris pyxidata reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants.</p>
