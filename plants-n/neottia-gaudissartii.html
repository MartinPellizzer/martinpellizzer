                    <h1>Neottia gaudissartii</h1>
<p>Neottia gaudissartii, commonly known as the Gaudissart's twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems.</p>
<p>Neottia gaudissartii is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake.</p>
