<p>Neptunia, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland and marshy environments, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Neptunia species often have hairy leaves and showy blue or violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Their roots are capable of tolerating waterlogged soil, making them important in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
