                    <h1>Nephrodium kilemense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium kilemense, commonly known as the Kilemense kidney fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephroidiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium kilemense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
