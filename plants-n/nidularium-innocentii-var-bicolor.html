                    <h1>Nidularium innocentii var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Nidularium innocentii var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored fairy duster, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that displays two distinct colors, typically pink and white, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers bloom in a spiky, candle-like structure, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
