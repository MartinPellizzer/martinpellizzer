                    <h1>Neostrearia fleckeri</h1>
<p>Neostrearia fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen that thrives in specific, often isolated environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a dense, tightly adherent layer on its substrate. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its distribution is limited to a few locations, primarily in southern Australia, where it grows on rock surfaces or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neostrearia fleckeri is considered a valuable indicator of environmental stability and ecological health.</p>
