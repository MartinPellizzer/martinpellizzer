                    <h1>Neoporteria caliginophila</h1>
<p>Neoporteria caliginophila, commonly known as the misty swamp orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in swampy areas with rich organic soil. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
