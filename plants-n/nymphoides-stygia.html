                    <h1>Nymphoides stygia</h1>
<p>Nymphoides stygia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Nymphoides stygia is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
