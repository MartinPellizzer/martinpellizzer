<p>Nephrodium otaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a rosette of silvery, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Nephrodium otaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
