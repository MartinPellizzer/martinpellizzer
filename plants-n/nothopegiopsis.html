                    <h1>Nothopegiopsis</h1>
<p>Nothopegiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Nothopegiopsis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
