                    <h1>Nesogordonia dewevrei</h1>
<p>Nesogordonia dewevrei, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a large, slow-growing tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight trunk, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters, and its pinnate leaves that can extend over 5 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fruits, each containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, oily pulp. It is an important species for both ecological and economic reasons, particularly in the production of palm oil.</p>
<p>However, its natural habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation and land conversion.</p>
