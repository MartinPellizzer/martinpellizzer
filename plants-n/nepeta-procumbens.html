<p>Nepeta procumbens, commonly known as catmint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Nepeta procumbens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its historical use as a mild sedative and insect repellent.</p>
