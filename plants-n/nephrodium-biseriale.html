<p>Nephrodium biseriale, commonly known as the two-rowed kidney fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, with a broad, undulating form. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome from which the fronds emerge, and its leaves are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. Nephrodium biseriale thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
