                    <h1>Neobotrydium botrys</h1>
<p>Neobotrydium botrys, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater environments in North America and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water. Neobotrydium botrys plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology and ecological function make it an important species in freshwater botany.</p>
