                    <h1>Neomirandea hitchcockii</h1>
<p>Neomirandea hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's neomirandea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its compact growth form. Its small, bi- or tri-lobed leaves and clustered inflorescences are key botanical features that distinguish it from related species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range.</p>
