                    <h1>Nephrodium sikkimense</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim nephrolepis, is a rare fern species native to the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
