<p>Narcissus tenorei subsp.</p>
<p>aschersonii, commonly known as the Ascherson's daffodil, is a rare and ornamental member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, this subspecies thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, linear leaves and a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
