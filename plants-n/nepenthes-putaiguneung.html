                    <h1>Nepenthes putaiguneung</h1>
<p>Nepenthes putaiguneung, commonly known as the Kalinga Pitcher Plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often red-tinged pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant's nectar-producing rim lures prey into the hollow cavity, where digestive enzymes break them down. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>
