                    <h1>Notholaena chalcolepis</h1>
<p>Notholaena chalcolepis, commonly known as the copper-scaled fern, is a rare and striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, copper-colored fronds that are covered in fine, overlapping scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Notholaena chalcolepis is native to the southeastern United States and is considered a unique example of fern adaptation to specific ecological niches.</p>
