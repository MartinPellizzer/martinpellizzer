<p>Nesogordonia crassipes var. insularis, commonly known as the Madagascar rosewood, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, aromatic scent. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected under international conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
