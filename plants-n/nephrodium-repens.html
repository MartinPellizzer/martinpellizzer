                    <h1>Nephrodium repens</h1>
<p>Nephrodium repens, commonly known as the creeping nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, horizontal stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant has lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
