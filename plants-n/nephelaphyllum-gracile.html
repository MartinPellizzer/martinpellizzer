<p>Nephelaphyllum gracile, commonly known as the delicate mist fern, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the humid cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble delicate wisps of mist, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing as clusters of spore-producing capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, Nephelaphyllum gracile is considered a conservation concern.</p>
