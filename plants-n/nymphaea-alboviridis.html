                    <h1>Nymphaea alboviridis</h1>
<p>Nymphaea alboviridis, commonly known as the white-green water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers are typically white or pale green, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
