                    <h1>Nymphaea atrans</h1>
<p>Nymphaea atrans, commonly known as the black water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, round leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a striking contrast to the green foliage of other water lilies. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Nymphaea atrans thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in swampy areas with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects.</p>
