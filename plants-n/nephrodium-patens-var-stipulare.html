<p>Nephrodium patens var. stipulare, commonly known as the stipulate nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, leaf-like stipules along the leaf stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
