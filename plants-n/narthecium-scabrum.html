                    <h1>Narthecium scabrum</h1>
<p>Narthecium scabrum, commonly known as the rough mountain sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Narthecium scabrum is typically found in open meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
