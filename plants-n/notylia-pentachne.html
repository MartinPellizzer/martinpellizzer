<p>Notylia pentachne, commonly known as the five-awned notylia, is a species of grass native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets with five awns, which are bristle-like structures at the ends of the florets. Notylia pentachne typically grows in open, grassy habitats and is adapted to dry or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features.</p>
