<p>Nhandiroba trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Nhandiroba trilobata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
