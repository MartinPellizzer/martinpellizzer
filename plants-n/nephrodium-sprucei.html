                    <h1>Nephrodium sprucei</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sprucei, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, freshwater environments such as mountain streams and pools. The plant has finely divided, creeping fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Nephrodium sprucei plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic habitat.</p>
