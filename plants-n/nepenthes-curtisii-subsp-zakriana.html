<p>Nepenthes curtisii subsp.</p>
<p>zakriana, commonly known as the Zakriana pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that produce a sticky fluid to trap prey.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil, typical of tropical rainforests. Its pitchers are often green or red in color, depending on light exposure, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to its ecological niche and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
