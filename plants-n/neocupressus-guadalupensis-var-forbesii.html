                    <h1>Neocupressus guadalupensis var. forbesii</h1>
<p>Neocupressus guadalupensis var. forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' Arizona cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its wood is dense and aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
