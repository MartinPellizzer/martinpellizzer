                    <h1>Neooreophilus tridactylus</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus tridactylus, commonly known as the three-toed forest fern, is a rare and ancient plant species found in the dense, humid undergrowth of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, inconspicuous clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neooreophilus tridactylus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
