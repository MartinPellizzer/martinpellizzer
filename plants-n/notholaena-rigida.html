<p>Notholaena rigida, commonly known as rigid notholaena, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Notholaena rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
