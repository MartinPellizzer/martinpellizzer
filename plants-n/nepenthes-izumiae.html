<p>Nepenthes izumiae, commonly known as the Izu Island pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated pitchers that are typically green with red or orange markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its pitchers secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects, which are then digested by enzymes.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat.</p>
