                    <h1>Nitraria senegalensis</h1>
<p>Nitraria senegalensis, commonly known as the African date tree, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish flowers that give way to edible, date-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low fruit yield compared to other date species.</p>
