<p>Nageia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud forest nageia, is a species of conifer native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, evergreen trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its leaves are typically dark green and slightly curved, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Nageia nubigena plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various forest organisms.</p>
