                    <h1>Niphobolus tricholepis</h1>
<p>Niphobolus tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes true nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its hairy, opposite leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Niphobolus tricholepis is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most species of Urtica.</p>
