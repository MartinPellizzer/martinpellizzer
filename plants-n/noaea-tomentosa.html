                    <h1>Noaea tomentosa</h1>
<p>Noaea tomentosa, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Noaea tomentosa is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
