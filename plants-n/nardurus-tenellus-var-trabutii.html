                    <h1>Nardurus tenellus var. trabutii</h1>
<p>Nardurus tenellus var. trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's nardus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
