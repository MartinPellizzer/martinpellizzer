                    <h1>Nepenthes ampullaria var. guttata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes ampullaria var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitchers that are often adorned with red or orange stripes and yellow spots. The plant produces a sticky digestive fluid in its pitcher to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, lowland habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique coloration and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
