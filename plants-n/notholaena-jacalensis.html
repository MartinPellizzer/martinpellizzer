                    <h1>Notholaena jacalensis</h1>
<p>Notholaena jacalensis, commonly known as the jacalena feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Notholaena jacalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert wildlife.</p>
