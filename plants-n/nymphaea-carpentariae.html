                    <h1>Nymphaea carpentariae</h1>
<p>Nymphaea carpentariae, commonly known as the Carpentaria water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
