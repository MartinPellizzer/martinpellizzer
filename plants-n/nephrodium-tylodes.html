<p>Nephrodium tylodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish sori that produce spores, facilitating its spread in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Nephrodium tylodes plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
