                    <h1>Neodryas schildhaueri</h1>
<p>Neodryas schildhaueri, commonly known as the Schildhauer's bristle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and it requires high humidity and well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
