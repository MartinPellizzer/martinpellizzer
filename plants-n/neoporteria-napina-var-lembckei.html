<p>Neoporteria napina var. lembckei, commonly known as the Lembcke's snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are slender and often branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
