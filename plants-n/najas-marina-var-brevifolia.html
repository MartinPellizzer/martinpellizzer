<p>Najas marina var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water nymph, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important species in freshwater biodiversity.</p>
