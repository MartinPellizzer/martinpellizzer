<p>Nephrodium antioquianum, commonly known as the Antioquian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Antioquia, Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, kidney-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nephrodium antioquianum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
