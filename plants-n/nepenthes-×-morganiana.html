                    <h1>Nepenthes × morganiana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × morganiana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to the Malay Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana, resulting in a plant with unique morphological traits. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped pitcher structures that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Nepenthes × morganiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
