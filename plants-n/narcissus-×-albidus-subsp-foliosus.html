<p>Narcissus × albidus subsp.</p>
<p>foliosus, commonly known as the white narcissus or white daffodil, is a hybrid species within the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often broader than those of typical daffodils. It is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its foliosus trait, which refers to the broader leaves compared to other narcissus varieties.</p>
