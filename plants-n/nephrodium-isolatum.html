                    <h1>Nephrodium isolatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium isolatum, commonly known as the solitary kidney fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, solitary fronds that emerge directly from the rhizome, lacking the typical branching structure seen in most ferns. The plant has a distinctive kidney-shaped leaf, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephrodium isolatum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
