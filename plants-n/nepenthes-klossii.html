                    <h1>Nepenthes klossii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes klossii, commonly known as Kloss's pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the island of Halmahera in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and dissolve insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, N. klossii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
