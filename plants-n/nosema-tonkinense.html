                    <h1>Nosema tonkinense</h1>
<p>Nosema tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin nosema, is a microscopic protist belonging to the family Nosematidae.</p>
<p>It is an obligate intracellular parasite that primarily infects the gut epithelial cells of honeybees. The organism is characterized by its ability to form spores, which are resistant to environmental stress and can persist in the hive for extended periods. These spores are ingested by bees and germinate within the host's digestive tract, leading to the proliferation of the parasite.</p>
<p>The infection can significantly impact the health and survival of honeybee colonies, making it a subject of concern in apiculture.</p>
