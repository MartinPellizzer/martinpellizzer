                    <h1>Nepenthes rubromaculata</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rubromaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown pitcher-shaped traps with orange-red markings. The plant produces nectar to lure insects into its modified leaves, where they are digested by digestive enzymes. Its habitat consists of nutrient-poor soils in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its vibrant colors and specialized adaptations for capturing prey.</p>
