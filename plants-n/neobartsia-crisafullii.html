<p>Neobartsia crisafullii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Neobartsia crisafullii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
