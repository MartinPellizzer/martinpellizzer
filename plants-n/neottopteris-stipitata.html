                    <h1>Neottopteris stipitata</h1>
<p>Neottopteris stipitata, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are clustered and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
