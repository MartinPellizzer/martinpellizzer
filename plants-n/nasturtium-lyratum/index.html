                            <h1>Nasturtium Lyratum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium lyratum is a striking aquatic plant known for its vibrant, lyre-shaped leaves and delicate, floating flowers. Native to southern and eastern Asia, it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a popular choice for water gardens and pond ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
