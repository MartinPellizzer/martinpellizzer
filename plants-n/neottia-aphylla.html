                    <h1>Neottia aphylla</h1>
<p>Neottia aphylla, commonly known as the naked-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions, it thrives in woodlands and heaths. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
