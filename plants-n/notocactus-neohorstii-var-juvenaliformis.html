<p>Notocactus neohorstii var. juvenaliformis, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of short, cylindrical stems that resemble coral branches, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled environments.</p>
