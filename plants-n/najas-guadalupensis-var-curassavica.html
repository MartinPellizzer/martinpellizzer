                    <h1>Najas guadalupensis var. curassavica</h1>
<p>Najas guadalupensis var. curassavica, commonly known as the Guadalupine watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater stands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of N. guadalupensis.</p>
