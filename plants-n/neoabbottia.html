                    <h1>Neoabbottia</h1>
<p>Neoabbottia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often appearing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Neoabbottia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
