                    <h1>Neopaulia alpina</h1>
<p>Neopaulia alpina, commonly known as the alpine neopaulia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Neopaulia alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming a dense carpet that helps prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
