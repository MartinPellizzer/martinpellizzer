                    <h1>Navarretia capitata</h1>
<p>Navarretia capitata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically blue or purple in color, which appears in early spring. Navarretia capitata is adapted to high-altitude habitats and is often found in rocky soils or open meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
