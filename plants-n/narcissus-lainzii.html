<p>Narcissus lainzii, commonly known as the Lanz Island daffodil, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive white throat, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in coastal areas or on cliffs. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Narcissus lainzii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
