<p>Nasturtium palustre var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy marsh nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its "hairy" descriptor. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in marshy areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
