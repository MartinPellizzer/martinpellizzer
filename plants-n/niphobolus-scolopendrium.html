                    <h1>Niphobolus scolopendrium</h1>
<p>Niphobolus scolopendrium, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces, thriving in moist and shaded environments. The thallus of Niphobolus scolopendrium is usually crust-like or foliose, with a yellowish-green coloration due to the presence of the algal partner. It is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and physiology reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor substrates and its reliance on both photosynthetic and fungal components for survival.</p>
