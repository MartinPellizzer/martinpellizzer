                    <h1>Neerija dichotoma</h1>
<p>Neerija dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous neerija, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Neerija dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
