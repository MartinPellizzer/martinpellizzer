                    <h1>Neocastela</h1>
<p>Neocastela, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Neocastela thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saline water, and is adapted to tidal conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
