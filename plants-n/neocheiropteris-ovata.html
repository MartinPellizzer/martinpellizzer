                    <h1>Neocheiropteris ovata</h1>
<p>Neocheiropteris ovata, commonly known as the ovate shield fern, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Marattiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically preserved as compressions in ancient sedimentary rocks. The plant exhibits a complex venation pattern, which provides insights into the evolutionary development of ferns. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are often found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Neocheiropteris ovata thrived during the Late Paleozoic era, contributing to the dense vegetation of ancient forests.</p>
