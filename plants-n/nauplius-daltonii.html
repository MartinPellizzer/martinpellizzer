                    <h1>Nauplius daltonii</h1>
<p>Nauplius daltonii, commonly known as the Dalton's nauplius, is a species of copepod found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Calanoida and is characterized by its small, transparent body and distinct appendages. The plant-like appearance of its larvae has led to its classification within the phylum Appendicularia, though it is not a true plant. It plays a role in marine food webs as both a predator and prey.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves several developmental stages, including a free-swimming nauplius stage.</p>
