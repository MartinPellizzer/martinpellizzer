                    <h1>Nuttallia lutea</h1>
<p>Nuttallia lutea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which comes from the presence of specific pigments in its thallus. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. It is a crustose lichen, meaning it forms a thin, crust-like layer on its substrate.</p>
<p>Nuttallia lutea is often found in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
