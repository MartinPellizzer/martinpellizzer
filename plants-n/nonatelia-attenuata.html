<p>Nonatelia attenuata, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Nonatelia attenuata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
