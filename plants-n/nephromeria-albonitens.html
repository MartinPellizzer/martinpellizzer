                    <h1>Nephromeria albonitens</h1>
<p>Nephromeria albonitens, commonly known as the white-flowered nephromeria, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from white to pale yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. Its leaves are typically ovate and glossy, with a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Nephromeria albonitens is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
