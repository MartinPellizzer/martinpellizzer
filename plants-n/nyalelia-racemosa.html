                    <h1>Nyalelia racemosa</h1>
<p>Nyalelia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its adaptations to harsh environments include thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Nyalelia racemosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to regions with limited rainfall.</p>
