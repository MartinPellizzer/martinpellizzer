<p>Nephrodium laetum, commonly known as the golden kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are bright green and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
