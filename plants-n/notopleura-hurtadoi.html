<p>Notopleura hurtadoi, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers, which are typically a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to capture light in the shaded understory.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
