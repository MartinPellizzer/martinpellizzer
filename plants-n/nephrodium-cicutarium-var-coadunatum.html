<p>Nephrodium cicutarium var. coadunatum, commonly known as the Caddisfly Fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
