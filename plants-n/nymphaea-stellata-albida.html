<p>Nymphaea stellata albida, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy, white petals that surround a yellow center, creating a striking visual display. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically floating, with a thick, spongy structure that helps them remain buoyant.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close at midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
