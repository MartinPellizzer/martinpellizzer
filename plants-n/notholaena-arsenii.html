                    <h1>Notholaena arsenii</h1>
<p>Notholaena arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Notholaena arsenii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
