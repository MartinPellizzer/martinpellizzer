<p>Nephrodium mohrioides, commonly known as the Mohri's nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium mohrioides is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical rarity.</p>
