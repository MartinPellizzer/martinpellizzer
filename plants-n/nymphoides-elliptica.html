                    <h1>Nymphoides elliptica</h1>
<p>Nymphoides elliptica, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy upper surface and a velvety underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the early morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Nymphoides elliptica is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
