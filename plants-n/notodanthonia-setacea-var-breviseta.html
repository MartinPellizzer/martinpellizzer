                    <h1>Notodanthonia setacea var. breviseta</h1>
<p>Notodanthonia setacea var. breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-haired hairgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems, a characteristic common in the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable component of native vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
