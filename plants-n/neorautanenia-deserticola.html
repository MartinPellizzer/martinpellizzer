<p>Neorautanenia deserticola, commonly known as the desert saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Neorautanenia deserticola plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
