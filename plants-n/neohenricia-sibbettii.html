                    <h1>Neohenricia sibbettii</h1>
<p>Neohenricia sibbettii, commonly known as the Sibbett's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, pine flatwood habitats and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks a visible stem, making it appear almost like a cluster of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
