                    <h1>Nolina arenicola</h1>
<p>Nolina arenicola, commonly known as the sand nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Nolina arenicola is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
