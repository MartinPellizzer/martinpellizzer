<p>Neodawsonia totolapensis, commonly known as the Totolapensis cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
