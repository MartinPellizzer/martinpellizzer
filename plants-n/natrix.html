                    <h1>Natrix</h1>
<p>Natrix, commonly known as the grass snake, is a non-venomous colubrid snake found throughout Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, rough scales, and a distinctive yellow or orange stripe running down its back. The plant named Natrix is not a botanical term; it refers to a species of snake. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
