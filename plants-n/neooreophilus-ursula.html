                    <h1>Neooreophilus ursula</h1>
<p>Neooreophilus ursula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has thin, wiry roots that help it anchor to tree bark while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Neooreophilus ursula is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
