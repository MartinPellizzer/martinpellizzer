                    <h1>Nemophila menziesii f. arenaria</h1>
<p>Nemophila menziesii f. arenaria, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It produces small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
