                    <h1>Neodissochaeta compressa</h1>
<p>Neodissochaeta compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>Neodissochaeta compressa is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
