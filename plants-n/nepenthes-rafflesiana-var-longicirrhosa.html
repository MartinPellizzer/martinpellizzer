                    <h1>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. longicirrhosa</h1>
<p>Nepenthes rafflesiana var. longicirrhosa, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcher plant, is a striking tropical carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a long, slender stem and vibrant red or orange-colored pitchers that serve as both a lure and a trap for prey. It thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing epiphytically on trees.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and its role in ecological studies of carnivorous plants.</p>
