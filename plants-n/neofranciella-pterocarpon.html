                    <h1>Neofranciella pterocarpon</h1>
<p>Neofranciella pterocarpon, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Neofranciella pterocarpon plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations.</p>
