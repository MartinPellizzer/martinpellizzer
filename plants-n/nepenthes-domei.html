                    <h1>Nepenthes domei</h1>
<p>Nepenthes domei, commonly known as the dome pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, dome-shaped leaf pitchers that trap and digest insect prey. The plant's unique morphology includes a waxy, glandular surface that secretes digestive enzymes and a lid that prevents rainwater from diluting the digestive fluid. Nepenthes domei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
