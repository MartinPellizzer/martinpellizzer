                    <h1>Nymphoides parviflora</h1>
<p>Nymphoides parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and produces delicate white or pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, and is often found in wetland environments. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its stems rise to support the floating foliage.</p>
<p>Nymphoides parviflora plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
