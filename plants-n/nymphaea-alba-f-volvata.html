<p>Nymphaea alba f. volvata, commonly known as the white water lily with curled petals, is a variant of the white water lily native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, semi-lobed petals that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy surface to repel water.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the early morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
