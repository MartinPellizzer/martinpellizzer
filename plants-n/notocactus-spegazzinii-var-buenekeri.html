<p>Notocactus spegazzinii var. buenekeri, commonly known as the "Buenekeri" notocactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
