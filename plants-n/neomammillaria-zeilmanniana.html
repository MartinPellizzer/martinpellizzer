                    <h1>Neomammillaria zeilmanniana</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria zeilmanniana, commonly known as the Zeilmannâ€™s fairy dunes cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant typically produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
