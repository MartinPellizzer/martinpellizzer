                    <h1>Nymphaea microphylla</h1>
<p>Nymphaea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Nymphaea microphylla plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
