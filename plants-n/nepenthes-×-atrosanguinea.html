                    <h1>Nepenthes × atrosanguinea</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-veined pitcher plant, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Nepenthes attenuata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, dark red to black pitchers that are often adorned with prominent veins. These pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
