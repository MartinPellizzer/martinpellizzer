                    <h1>Nepenthes saranganiensis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes saranganiensis, commonly known as the Sarangani pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its nectar-producing rim attracts insects, which then fall into the trap.</p>
<p>The botanical features of N. saranganiensis make it a unique subject of study in both botany and ecological research.</p>
