                    <h1>Narcissus oblitteratus</h1>
<p>Narcissus oblitteratus, commonly known as the ghost daffodil, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which gives it a striking yet subtle appearance. Due to its limited habitat and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in plant ecology and floral evolution.</p>
