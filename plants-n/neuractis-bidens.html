<p>Neuractis bidens, commonly known as the two-toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often have two small teeth at the base, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Neuractis bidens is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition.</p>
