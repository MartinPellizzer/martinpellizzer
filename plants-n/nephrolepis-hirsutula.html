<p>Nephrolepis hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, glossy fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under trees or in dense vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
