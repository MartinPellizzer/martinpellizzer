                    <h1>Notophilus</h1>
<p>Notophilus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Notophilus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
