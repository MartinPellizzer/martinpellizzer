<p>Nephrolepis × copelandii, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Nephrolepis hirsutula and Nephrolepis falcata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lush, arching fronds that are dark green and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid environments and prefers indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The Boston fern is also valued for its ability to purify the air and enhance the aesthetic appeal of any space.</p>
