                    <h1>Neltuma arenosa</h1>
<p>Neltuma arenosa, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism known as a lichen. This plant is typically found on rock surfaces, soil, or other substrates where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its structure is flattened and crust-like, allowing it to withstand harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Neltuma arenosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its habitat.</p>
