                    <h1>Northia seychellana</h1>
<p>Northia seychellana, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in coastal forests or on rocky outcrops. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
