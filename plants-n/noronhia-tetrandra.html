                    <h1>Noronhia tetrandra</h1>
<p>Noronhia tetrandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hard, woody fruits containing small, black seeds. Noronhia tetrandra is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
