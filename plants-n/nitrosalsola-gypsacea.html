                    <h1>Nitrosalsola gypsacea</h1>
<p>Nitrosalsola gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum nitrate plant, is a halophytic species adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with high concentrations of gypsum. The plant exhibits succulent leaves and stems, which help it store water in harsh conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and salt flats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to tolerate extreme salinity makes it an important subject in studies of plant adaptation.</p>
