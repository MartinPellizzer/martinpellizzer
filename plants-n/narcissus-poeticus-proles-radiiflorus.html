                    <h1>Narcissus poeticus proles radiiflorus</h1>
<p>Narcissus poeticus proles radiiflorus, commonly known as the Radiant Crown Narcissus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a golden-yellow perianth with a distinctive radiating pattern of white and green markings. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several blooms, each with a cup-shaped corona that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitats.</p>
