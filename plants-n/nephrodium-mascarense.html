<p>Nephrodium mascarense, commonly known as the Mascarene kidney fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests or rocky areas. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
