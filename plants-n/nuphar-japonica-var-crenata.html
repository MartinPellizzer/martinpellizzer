                    <h1>Nuphar japonica var. crenata</h1>
<p>Nuphar japonica var. crenata, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a distinctive wavy or scalloped edge, which is characteristic of the 'crenata' variety. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water bodies, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a habitat and food source for aquatic organisms.</p>
