                    <h1>Nephopteris</h1>
<p>Nephopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Nephopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. They have rhizomes that are usually short and produce a dense network of roots.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
