<p>Neooreophilus cordilabius, commonly known as the silver-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
