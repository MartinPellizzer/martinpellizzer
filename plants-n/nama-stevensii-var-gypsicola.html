<p>Nama stevensii var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly on gypsum-rich substrates. The plant's structure is typically crust-like, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of specific soil types and environmental conditions.</p>
