                    <h1>Neomammillaria polycentra var. pretiosa</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria polycentra var. pretiosa, commonly known as the Pretiosa Bunny Ears Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus with a globular shape and dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>It features a central stem that branches into multiple ribs, each adorned with clusters of short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Native to the arid regions of Mexico, it thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
