                    <h1>Nephrotheca ilicifolia</h1>
<p>Nephrotheca ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf nephrotheca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture that contributes to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Nephrotheca ilicifolia is often found in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
