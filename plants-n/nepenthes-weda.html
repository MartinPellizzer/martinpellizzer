                    <h1>Nepenthes weda</h1>
<p>Nepenthes weda, commonly known as the Wenda pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to the Indonesian island of Sumba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to break down insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and green, with the lower part of the pitcher often displaying a striking red or purple coloration. Nepenthes weda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
