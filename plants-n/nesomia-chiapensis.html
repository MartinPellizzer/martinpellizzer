<p>Nesomia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly found in the humid forests of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a slender stem that supports its delicate, showy blooms.</p>
