<p>Notholaena javensis, commonly known as the Java notholaena, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizome is short and creeping, with a dense network of roots that help it anchor in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are usually covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
