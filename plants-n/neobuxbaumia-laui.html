<p>Neobuxbaumia laui, commonly known as the Laui's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by various insects. Its fruit, known as a "tuna," is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Neobuxbaumia laui plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert wildlife.</p>
