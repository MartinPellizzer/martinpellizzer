<p>Nolina histrix, commonly known as the needleleaf nolina, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that resembles a pinecone. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Nolina histrix is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
