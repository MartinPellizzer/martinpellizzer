<p>Nauclea media, commonly known as the small nauclea, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape.

Nauclea media is typically found in woodland and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is not widely cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles.</p>
