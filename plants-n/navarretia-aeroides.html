<p>Navarretia aeroides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a delicate annual plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the flowering plant family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as coastal bluffs and dry slopes.
