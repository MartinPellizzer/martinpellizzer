The flowers are fragrant and white, often appearing in clusters, and are a key feature for identification. This variant is distinguished by its slightly curved spines on the stems, which give it its specific epithet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important plant.</p>
