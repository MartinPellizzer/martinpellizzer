<p>Nothocissus sterculiifolia, commonly known as the desert grapevine, is a climbing plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Nothocissus sterculiifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
