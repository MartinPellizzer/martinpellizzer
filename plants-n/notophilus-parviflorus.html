                    <h1>Notophilus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Notophilus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own food through photosynthesis. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a common sight in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate the health of the host tree and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
