                    <h1>Neocalyptrocalyx atlanticus</h1>
<p>Neocalyptrocalyx atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic crypton, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait in coastal flora. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neocalyptrocalyx atlanticus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
