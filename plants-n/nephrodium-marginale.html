                    <h1>Nephrodium marginale</h1>
<p>Nephrodium marginale, commonly known as the marginated nephroid, is a rare fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant's leaves are typically green with a smooth texture and lack the typical spore-bearing structures found in most ferns. Nephrodium marginale thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
