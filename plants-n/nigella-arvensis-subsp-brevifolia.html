<p>Nigella arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cowslip, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often confused with other Nigella species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its shorter leaves and specific geographic distribution.</p>
