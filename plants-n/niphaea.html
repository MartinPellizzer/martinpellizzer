                    <h1>Niphaea</h1>
<p>Niphaea, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant found in shallow freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Niphaea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
