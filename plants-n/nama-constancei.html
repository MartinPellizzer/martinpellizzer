                    <h1>Nama constancei</h1>
<p>Nama constancei, commonly known as the Constance's nama, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Nama constancei is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
