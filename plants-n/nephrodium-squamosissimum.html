<p>Nephrodium squamosissimum, commonly known as the scalycushion fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, compact growth habit and its finely divided, scaly fronds that give it a rugged appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Nephrodium squamosissimum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
