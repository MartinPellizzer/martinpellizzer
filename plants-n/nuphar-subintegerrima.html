<p>Nuphar subintegerrima, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Nuphar subintegerrima plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
