<p>Noccaea maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and can tolerate salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>Noccaea maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic value.</p>
