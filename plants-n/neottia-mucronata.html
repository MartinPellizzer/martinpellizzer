                    <h1>Neottia mucronata</h1>
<p>Neottia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories.</p>
