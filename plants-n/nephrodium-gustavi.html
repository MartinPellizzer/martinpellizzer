                    <h1>Nephrodium gustavi</h1>
<p>Nephrodium gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's kidney fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium gustavi is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
