                    <h1>Neoporteria napina var. aerocarpa</h1>
<p>Neoporteria napina var. aerocarpa, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the white blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
