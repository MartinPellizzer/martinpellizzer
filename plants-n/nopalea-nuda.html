                    <h1>Nopalea nuda</h1>
<p>Nopalea nuda, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and the absence of the typical greenish bloom found on other Opuntia species. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The fruit, when it forms, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor, making it a valuable resource in some regions.</p>
