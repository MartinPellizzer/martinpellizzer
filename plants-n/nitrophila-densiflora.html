<p>Nitrophila densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered nitrophila, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense inflorescence.

It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and ecological niches.</p>
