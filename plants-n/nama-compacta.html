                    <h1>Nama compacta</h1>
<p>Nama compacta, commonly known as the compact milkweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its dry environment. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which can be toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>Nama compacta plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
