<p>Nigritella nigra f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract nigritella, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated bracts that envelop the floral structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences from the standard Nigritella nigra.</p>
