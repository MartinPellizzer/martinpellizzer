<p>Noccaea venusta, commonly known as the silverleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Noccaea venusta thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
