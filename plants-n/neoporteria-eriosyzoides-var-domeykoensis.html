The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
