                    <h1>Nephrodium ferrugineum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty nephroid, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant's fronds are typically dark green with a rusty-brown margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium ferrugineum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
