<p>Notodanthonia carphoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Notodanthonia carphoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
