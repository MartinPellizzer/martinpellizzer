                    <h1>Nania</h1>
<p>Nania, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and small, pale pink flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions. The plant has a short growing season and requires cool, moist conditions to thrive. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nania is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
