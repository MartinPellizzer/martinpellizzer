                    <h1>Nolina micrantha</h1>
<p>Nolina micrantha, commonly known as the small-leaved nolina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of gray-green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Nolina micrantha is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
