<p>Nemexia, commonly known as the "buttercup grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. Nemexia species are typically low-growing, herbaceous plants with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. They have fibrous roots and are often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate appearance.</p>
