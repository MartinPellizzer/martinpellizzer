                    <h1>Notholaena streetiae</h1>
<p>Notholaena streetiae, commonly known as the street's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
