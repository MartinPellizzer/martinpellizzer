<p>Notothlaspi viretum, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb water from the soil.</p>
<p>Notothlaspi viretum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
