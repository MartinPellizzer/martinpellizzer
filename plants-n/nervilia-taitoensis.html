                    <h1>Nervilia taitoensis</h1>
<p>Nervilia taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito fern, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia taitoensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
