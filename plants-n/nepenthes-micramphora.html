                    <h1>Nepenthes micramphora</h1>
<p>Nepenthes micramphora, commonly known as the small-leaf pitcher plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow pitcher-shaped traps that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting insects. Its pitchers secrete a sticky fluid to trap prey, which is then digested by enzymes.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
