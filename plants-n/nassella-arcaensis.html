                    <h1>Nassella arcaensis</h1>
<p>Nassella arcaensis, commonly known as the Arcaens grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Nassella arcaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
