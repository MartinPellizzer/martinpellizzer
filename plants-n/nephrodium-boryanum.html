<p>Nephrodium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium boryanum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
