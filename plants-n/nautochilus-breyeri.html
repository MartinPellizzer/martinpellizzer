                    <h1>Nautochilus breyeri</h1>
<p>Nautochilus breyeri, commonly known as the Beyer's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a vulnerable species, often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nautochilus breyeri is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
