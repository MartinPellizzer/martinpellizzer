                    <h1>Narcissus × cothurnalis</h1>
<p>Narcissus × cothurnalis, commonly known as the double daffodil, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Narcissus tazetta and Narcissus poeticus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enlarged, petal-like tepals that form a distinctive double crown, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical daffodils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its vibrant yellow color and extended blooming period in early spring.</p>
