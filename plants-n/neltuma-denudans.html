<p>Neltuma denudans, commonly known as the naked neltuma, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma denudans is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
