                    <h1>Notodanthonia monticola</h1>
<p>Notodanthonia monticola, commonly known as the mountain sandplain grass, is a perennial grass species native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to low-nutrient environments and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes considered a keystone species in its native habitat.</p>
