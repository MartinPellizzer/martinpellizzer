<p>Notocactus sessiliflorus f. vorwerkianus, commonly known as the Vorwerk's short-flowered notocactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its arid habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection.</p>
<p>This unique variant is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and limited distribution.</p>
