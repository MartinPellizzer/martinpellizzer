                            <h1>Nepeta Yazdiana</h1>
<p>Persian catmint, scientifically known as Nepeta yazdiana, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran. With its delicate blue-violet flowers and aromatic foliage, it has long been cherished for its ornamental beauty and calming properties. This hardy plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a favorite among gardeners in temperate climates. Its name is derived from its resemblance to the common catmint, which is also beloved by felines. Despite its modest size, Persian catmint holds cultural and medicinal significance in traditional Persian medicine.</p>
