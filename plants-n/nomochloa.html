                    <h1>Nomochloa</h1>
<p>Nomochloa, commonly known as the "drought-tolerant grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Nomochloa species are often used in landscaping for their resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Botanically, they are valued for their adaptability and ecological role in stabilizing soils in dry regions.</p>
