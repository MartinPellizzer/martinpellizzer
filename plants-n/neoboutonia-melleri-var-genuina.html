<p>Neoboutonia melleri var. genuina, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive lip that is often a different color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
