                    <h1>Neoporteria wagenknechtii var. microsperma</h1>
<p>Neoporteria wagenknechtii var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded neoporteria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are minute and require specific environmental conditions for germination, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
