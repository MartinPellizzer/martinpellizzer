<p>Notocactus horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that forms dense mats of cylindrical stems. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are covered in a layer of white, waxy hair that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Notocactus horstii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
