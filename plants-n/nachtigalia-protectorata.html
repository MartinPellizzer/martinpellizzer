                    <h1>Nachtigalia protectorata</h1>
<p>Nachtigalia protectorata, commonly known as the protected nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Nachtigalia protectorata is listed as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
