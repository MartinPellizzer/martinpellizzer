                    <h1>Notodanthonia nardifolia</h1>
<p>Notodanthonia nardifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
