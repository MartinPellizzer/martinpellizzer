<p>Nymphanthus niruri, commonly known as the water lily of paradise, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade over water surfaces, and its striking white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Nymphanthus niruri plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality.</p>
