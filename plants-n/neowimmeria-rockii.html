                    <h1>Neowimmeria rockii</h1>
<p>Neowimmeria rockii, commonly known as the Rock's neowimmeria, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. Neowimmeria rockii thrives in rocky soils with high drainage, often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
