                    <h1>Notogrammitis</h1>
<p>Notogrammitis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. Notogrammitis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow them to spread across forest floors or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
