                    <h1>Narcissus bulbocodium var. biflorus</h1>
<p>Narcissus bulbocodium var. biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered narcissus, is a rare and delicate plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single bulb that can give rise to multiple shoots, each bearing two to three flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
