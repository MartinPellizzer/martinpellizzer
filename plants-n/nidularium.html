                    <h1>Nidularium</h1>
<p>Nidularium, commonly known as the "bird's nest fern," is a type of epiphytic plant belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are often broad and waxy, with a fibrous, spongy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Nidularium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in shaded, moist garden settings.</p>
