                    <h1>Notholaena lemmonii var. straminea</h1>
<p>Notholaena lemmonii var. straminea, commonly known as the lemony stiltgrass, is a variant of the stiltgrass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often mistaken for grasses due to its similar appearance. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured surface.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
