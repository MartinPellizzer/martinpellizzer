                    <h1>Nemophila</h1>
<p>Nemophila, commonly known as fairy flowers, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America, particularly the western United States, and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to violet, and they typically bloom in spring. Nemophila species are often used in wildflower gardens due to their beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>They have hairy stems and leaves, which help them retain moisture in their preferred habitats.</p>
