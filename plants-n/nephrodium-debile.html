                    <h1>Nephrodium debile</h1>
<p>Nephrodium debile, commonly known as the slender nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium debile is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
