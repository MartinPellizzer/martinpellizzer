<p>Neustanthus javanicus, commonly known as the Java water lily, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Neustanthus javanicus plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
