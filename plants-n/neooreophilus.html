<p>Neooreophilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble translucent petals. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Neooreophilus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
