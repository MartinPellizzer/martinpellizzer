                    <h1>Neogriseocereus griseus</h1>
<p>Neogriseocereus griseus, commonly known as the grey gloxinia cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in a greyish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance desert landscapes.</p>
