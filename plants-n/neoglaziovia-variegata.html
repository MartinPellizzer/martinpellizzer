<p>Neoglaziovia variegata, commonly known as the variegated tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil and thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight. Its vibrant, showy inflorescences, which can range from red to orange, bloom once in its lifetime and then wither.</p>
<p>Neoglaziovia variegata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
