<p>Neoporteria taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to a harsh, arid climate. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neoporteria taltalensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution.</p>
