<p>Nephrodium glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The glandular features on its leaves may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores.</p>
