                    <h1>Nasturtium lippizense var. thracicum</h1>
<p>Nasturtium lippizense var. thracicum, commonly known as the Balkan watercress, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are submerged or floating, adapted for life in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, typical of the Tropaeolaceae family. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and along the edges of streams, where it contributes to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
