                    <h1>Noccaea alpina</h1>
<p>Noccaea alpina, commonly known as alpine nailwort, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its adaptations to cold and high-altitude environments include a compact growth form and a short growing season.</p>
<p>Noccaea alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience.</p>
