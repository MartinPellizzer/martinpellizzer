                    <h1>Nepenthes × neglecta</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × neglecta, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant produces striking, colorful pitcher-shaped traps that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted for climbing and photosynthesis in the dense rainforest canopy.</p>
<p>Nepenthes × neglecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique carnivorous characteristics.</p>
