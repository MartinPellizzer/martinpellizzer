<p>Nasa rubrastra, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking crimson petals and velvety leaves, which are adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nasa rubrastra is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
