<p>Nymphaea alba var. depressa, commonly known as the white water lily or dwarf white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features broad, smooth, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with a pale white to pale pink flower that blooms in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
