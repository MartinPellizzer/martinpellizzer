<p>Nunnezharia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall fern, is a tropical plant native to regions with high humidity and abundant rainfall.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble cascading water, hence its common name. The plant typically grows along stream banks and rocky outcrops, where it can access the moisture it requires. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist soil.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
