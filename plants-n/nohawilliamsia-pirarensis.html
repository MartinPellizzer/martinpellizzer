                    <h1>Nohawilliamsia pirarensis</h1>
<p>Nohawilliamsia pirarensis, commonly known as the Pirar√© cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
