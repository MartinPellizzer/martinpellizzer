                    <h1>Nephrodium sprengelii</h1>
<p>Nephrodium sprengelii, commonly known as the Sprengel's nephrolepis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, clustered sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
