                    <h1>Nephrodium prolixum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium prolixum, commonly known as the long-stalked nephroid, is a rare and intriguing fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium prolixum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
