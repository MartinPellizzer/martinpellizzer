                    <h1>Nopalea brittonii var. variegata</h1>
<p>Nopalea brittonii var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated Britton's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and display a distinctive variegated leaf-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spine-like structures, and the stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
