<p>Notiophrys commelynae, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface.</p>
<p>Notiophrys commelynae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
