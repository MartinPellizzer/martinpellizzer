                    <h1>Nephrolepis tuberosa var. pendula</h1>
<p>Nephrolepis tuberosa var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sword fern, is a varietal form of the sword fern genus Nephrolepis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that give it a cascading appearance, making it ideal for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the underside of its compound leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
