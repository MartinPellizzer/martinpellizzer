<p>Neanotis pahompokae, commonly known as the Pahompokae's neanotis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered green leaves and delicate white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of ongoing research in plant biology.</p>
