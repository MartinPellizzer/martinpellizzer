<p>Nananthus albinotus, commonly known as the white-spotted nananthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
