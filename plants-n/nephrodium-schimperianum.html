<p>Nephrodium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's nephrolepis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Nephrodium schimperianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
