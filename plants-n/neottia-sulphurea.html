                    <h1>Neottia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Neottia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports a single, narrow, yellowish-green leaf. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, often with a faint sulfur-like odor, which is characteristic of the genus.</p>
<p>Neottia sulphurea is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to biodiversity.</p>
