                    <h1>Nephrodium subquinquefidum var. elongatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium subquinquefidum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated nephroid, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central rachis and multiple pinnae arranged in a subquinquefid pattern. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
