                    <h1>Nuphar × fluminalis</h1>
<p>Nuphar × fluminalis, commonly known as the river yellow pond-lily, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds.</p>
<p>Nuphar × fluminalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
