                    <h1>Nama marshii</h1>
<p>Nama marshii, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Nama marshii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic animals.</p>
