<p>Neocheiropteris normalis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant's rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Neocheiropteris normalis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
