<p>Najas nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can impact aquatic ecosystems if not managed.</p>
