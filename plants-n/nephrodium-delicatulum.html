                    <h1>Nephrodium delicatulum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nephrodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing structures are clustered at the tips of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
