                    <h1>Nepenthes albomarginata var. villosa</h1>
<p>Nepenthes albomarginata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, elongated pitchers that are typically green with white or yellow marginal stripes. The plant produces a dense covering of fine, hairy trichomes on its stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other Nepenthes species. Its pitchers secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of rainforests.</p>
