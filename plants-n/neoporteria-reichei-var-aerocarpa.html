                    <h1>Neoporteria reichei var. aerocarpa</h1>
<p>Neoporteria reichei var. aerocarpa, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a light, airy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
