<p>Nelipus bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Nelipus bifida is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure, with a split or lobed appearance, aids in distinguishing it from other sedges.</p>
