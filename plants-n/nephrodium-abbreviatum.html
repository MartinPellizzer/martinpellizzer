                    <h1>Nephrodium abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nephroid, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, narrow base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters known as sori. Nephrodium abbreviatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
