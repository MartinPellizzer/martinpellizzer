                <h1>Neomammillaria eriacantha</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria eriacantha, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens.</p>
