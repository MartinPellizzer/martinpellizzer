<p>Nestotus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly nestotus, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
