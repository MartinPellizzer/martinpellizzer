<p>Nephrodium eatonii, commonly known as the Eaton's nephroid, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a kidney shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium eatonii is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
