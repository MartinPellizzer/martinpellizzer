                    <h1>Nephrodium crenulaeum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium crenulaeum, commonly known as the coral fern, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble coral.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's fronds are composed of small, overlapping leaflets that provide surface area for oxygen exchange. Nephrodium crenulaeum is often found in nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens.</p>
