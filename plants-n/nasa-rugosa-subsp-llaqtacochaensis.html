<p>Nasa rugosa subsp.</p>
<p>llaqtacochaensis, commonly known as the Llaqtacocha nasa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage is usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, which may serve as a protective adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
