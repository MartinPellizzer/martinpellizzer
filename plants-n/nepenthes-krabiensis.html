<p>Nepenthes krabiensis, commonly known as the Krabi pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitchers that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of green, red, or orange, depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>Nepenthes krabiensis plays a unique ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
