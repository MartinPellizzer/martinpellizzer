<p>Najas serristipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
