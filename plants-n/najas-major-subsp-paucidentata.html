<p>Najas major subsp.</p>
<p>paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, which develop into tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting water quality and native plant communities.</p>
