                    <h1>Neurocarpum frigidulum</h1>
<p>Neurocarpum frigidulum, commonly known as the Arctic neurocarpum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions of northern Canada and Greenland.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a short stem and tightly packed, dark green leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adapted to the short growing season in its extreme environment. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
