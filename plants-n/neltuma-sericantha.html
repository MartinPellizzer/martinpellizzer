                    <h1>Neltuma sericantha</h1>
<p>Neltuma sericantha, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the soil, and it has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Neltuma sericantha is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
