<p>Nephrodium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Nephrodium philippinense plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
