                    <h1>Nerisyrenia hypercorax</h1>
<p>Nerisyrenia hypercorax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of pine forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
