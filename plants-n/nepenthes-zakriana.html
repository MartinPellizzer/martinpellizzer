                    <h1>Nepenthes zakriana</h1>
<p>Nepenthes zakriana, commonly known as the Zakriana pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaf pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant's morphology includes a robust stem and broad, waxy leaves that form the lower part of the pitcher structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism allows it to capture and digest insects, making it an important species in ecological studies of carnivorous plants.</p>
