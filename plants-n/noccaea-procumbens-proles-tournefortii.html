                    <h1>Noccaea procumbens proles tournefortii</h1>
<p>Noccaea procumbens proles tournefortii, commonly known as the creeping whitlowgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
