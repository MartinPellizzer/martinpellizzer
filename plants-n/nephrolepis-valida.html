<p>Nephrolepis valida, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Nephrolepis valida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
