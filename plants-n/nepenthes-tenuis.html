                    <h1>Nepenthes tenuis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes tenuis, commonly known as the slender pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib that supports the formation of the pitcher structures. Nepenthes tenuis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
