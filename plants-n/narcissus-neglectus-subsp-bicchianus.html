<p>Narcissus neglectus subsp.</p>
<p>bicchianus, commonly known as the Sicilian daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the narcissus genus native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers with a single trumpet-shaped corona.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in Mediterranean climates. It blooms in early spring, producing bright yellow petals that contrast with its pale green foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
