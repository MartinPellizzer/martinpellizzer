                    <h1>Northia brevitubulata</h1>
<p>Northia brevitubulata, commonly known as the small-tubercled cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
