<p>Nephrodium nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
