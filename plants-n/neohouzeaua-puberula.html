                    <h1>Neohouzeaua puberula</h1>
<p>Neohouzeaua puberula, commonly known as the hairy neohouzeaua, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Neohouzeaua puberula is considered a conservation concern.</p>
