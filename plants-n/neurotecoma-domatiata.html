                    <h1>Neurotecoma domatiata</h1>
<p>Neurotecoma domatiata, commonly known as the domatia-bearing neurotecoma, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique domatia, which are small, hollow, plant-like structures that serve as shelters for symbiotic ants. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>The plant's ecological role is significant, as it supports ant populations that contribute to nutrient cycling and pest control in its habitat.</p>
