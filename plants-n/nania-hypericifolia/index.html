                            <h1>Nania Hypericifolia</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Nania hypericifolia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rocky soils of the western United States. This small perennial grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in crevices and on slopes where moisture is scarce. Its name comes from the striking blue-violet color of its flowers, which bloom in early summer. Despite its beauty, Blueweed is often overlooked due to its modest size and limited distribution. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
