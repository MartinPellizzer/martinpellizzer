                    <h1>Nephrodium polycarpum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium polycarpum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and endangered fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
