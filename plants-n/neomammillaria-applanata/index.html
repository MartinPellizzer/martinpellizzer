<p>Flat mammillaria, scientifically known as Neomammillaria applanata, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. This unique plant is characterized by its flat, rounded stems that resemble a compact shield, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. Despite its small size, it possesses a complex structure with areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions makes it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts. With minimal care and proper conditions, this plant can flourish, offering both beauty and resilience in a challenging environment.</p>
