<p>Nephrolepis crenata, commonly known as the Boston fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Nephrolepis crenata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
