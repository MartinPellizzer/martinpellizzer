<p>Nannothelypteris murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Nannothelypteris murkelensis is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, organic soil.</p>
