                    <h1>Nephrosis</h1>
<p>Nephrosis, commonly known as kidney moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on specialized stalks called setae.</p>
<p>Nephrosis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
