                    <h1>Neoporteria floccosa</h1>
<p>Neoporteria floccosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
