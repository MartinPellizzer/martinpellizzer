                    <h1>Neottia nidus-avis lusus sulphurea</h1>
<p>Neottia nidus-avis lusus sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur tailed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking yellowish-green inflorescences that resemble a bird's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is epipetric, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
