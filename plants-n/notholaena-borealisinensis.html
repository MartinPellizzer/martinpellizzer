                    <h1>Notholaena borealisinensis</h1>
<p>Notholaena borealisinensis, commonly known as the northern alpine fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of northern China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
