                    <h1>Neottia corallorhiza</h1>
<p>Neottia corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in forested areas. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its unique structure allows it to form symbiotic relationships with other plants, particularly trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of visible leaves, it plays a specialized role in forest ecosystems.</p>
