<p>Najas marina var. angustissima, commonly known as narrow-leaved watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often submerged or just below the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth can also lead to dense vegetation that may impact water flow and quality if left unchecked.</p>
