<p>Neottidium nidus-avis, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, which provides a habitat for small animals and insects. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural environment. It thrives in humid, shaded areas and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Neottidium nidus-avis is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to purify the air in indoor spaces.</p>
