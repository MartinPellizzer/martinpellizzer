                    <h1>Nicipe oreogenes</h1>
<p>Nicipe oreogenes, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Nicipe oreogenes plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
