<p>Nephrodium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's nephrolepis, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Nephrodium wilsonii is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
