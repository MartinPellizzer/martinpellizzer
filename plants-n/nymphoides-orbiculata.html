<p>Nymphoides orbiculata, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, opening in the morning and closing at night. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Nymphoides orbiculata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
