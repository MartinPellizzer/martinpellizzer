                    <h1>Nepenthes × chelsonii</h1>
<p>Nepenthes × chelsonii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant that results from the crossbreeding of Nepenthes alata and Nepenthes rafflesiana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky nectar to lure and trap insects. The plant's pitchers vary in color, often displaying shades of red, yellow, or green, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity.</p>
<p>This hybrid is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and unique carnivorous behavior.</p>
