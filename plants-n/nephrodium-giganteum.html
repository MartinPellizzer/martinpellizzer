<p>Nephrodium giganteum, commonly known as the giant nephroid, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth is slow and requires a humid, tropical environment with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Nephrodium giganteum is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
