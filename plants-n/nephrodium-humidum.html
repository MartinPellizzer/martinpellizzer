                    <h1>Nephrodium humidum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium humidum, commonly known as the swamp nephroid, is a rare aquatic plant found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its low visibility. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Nephrodium humidum plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
