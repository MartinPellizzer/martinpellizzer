                    <h1>Neocryptodiscus ammophilus</h1>
<p>Neocryptodiscus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a unique photobiont-dependent lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces and sand dunes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga, which provides photosynthetic capabilities necessary for nutrient production. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological stability.</p>
<p>Neocryptodiscus ammophilus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
