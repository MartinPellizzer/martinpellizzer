                    <h1>Nephrodium leucorhachis</h1>
<p>Nephrodium leucorhachis, commonly known as the white-stemmed nephroid, is a species of fern belonging to the family Nephrodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
