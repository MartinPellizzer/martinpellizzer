                    <h1>Neoregelia angustibracteolata</h1>
<p>Neoregelia angustibracteolata, commonly known as the narrow bract neoregelia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Neoregelia angustibracteolata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and moderate humidity.</p>
