                    <h1>Niobe</h1>
<p>Niobe, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and deep red, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in shallow waters. Niobe thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Nelumbo nucifera*, reflects its significance in both botany and cultural symbolism.</p>
