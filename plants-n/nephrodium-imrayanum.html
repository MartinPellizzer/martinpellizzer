                    <h1>Nephrodium imrayanum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium imrayanum, commonly known as the Malayan kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
