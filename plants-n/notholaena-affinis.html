<p>Notholaena affinis, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Notholaena affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, where it serves as a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
