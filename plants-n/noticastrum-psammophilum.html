<p>Noticastrum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or purple. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
<p>Noticastrum psammophilum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
