<p>Neottopteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name.</p>
