                    <h1>Neomammillaria rekoi</h1>
<p>Neomammillaria rekoi, commonly known as the Reko's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Neomammillaria rekoi is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
