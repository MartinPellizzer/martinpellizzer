<p>Nesaea dinteri subsp.</p>
<p>elata, commonly known as the tall nesaea, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. It is a perennial herb that produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
