                            <h1>Neottia Discolor</h1>
<p>Neottia discolor is a rare and enigmatic orchid found in the understory of temperate forests. It is known for its pale green to white flowers that lack the typical showy features of many orchids. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often difficult to spot due to its subtle appearance. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by supporting pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity. Despite its delicate beauty, Neottia discolor remains a mysterious and understudied species.</p>
