                    <h1>Nepenthes viridis</h1>
<p>Nepenthes viridis, commonly known as the green pitcher plant, is a tropical carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant green foliage and slender stems make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and greenhouses. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils make it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution.</p>
