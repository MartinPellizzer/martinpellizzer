<p>Narcissus jonquilla subsp.</p>
<p>henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' daffodil, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a single, delicate yellow flower with a narrow, trumpet-shaped corona.</p>
<p>Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet elegant touch to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
