<p>Nephrodium tenericaule, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
