                    <h1>Nervilia uniflora</h1>
<p>Nervilia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, slender spore-bearing spike at the tip of its stem, which is a distinctive feature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nervilia uniflora is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
