                    <h1>Nepeta tolypantha</h1>
<p>Nepeta tolypantha, commonly known as the Kashmiri catnip, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces aromatic compounds similar to those found in other Nepeta species, which can have mild effects on animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
