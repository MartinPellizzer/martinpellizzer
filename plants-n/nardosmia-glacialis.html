<p>Nardosmia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lily, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It blooms in late spring or early summer, often in the shadow of glaciers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
