<p>Natschia, commonly known as the "dwarf rock cress," is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae).</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, mat-forming species that thrive in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their delicate, often blue or purple flowers and small, pinnately divided leaves. Natschia species are often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where they tolerate harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
