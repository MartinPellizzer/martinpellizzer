                    <h1>Notopleura merumensis</h1>
<p>Notopleura merumensis, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily rimu and kahikatea, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. Notopleura merumensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests by influencing host tree growth and providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
