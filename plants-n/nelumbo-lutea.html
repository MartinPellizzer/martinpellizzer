                    <h1>Nelumbo lutea</h1>
<p>Nelumbo lutea, commonly known as the yellow lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The yellow lotus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
