                    <h1>Nefflea</h1>
<p>Nefflea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white petals that resemble wisps of mist. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Nefflea has small, inconspicuous leaves and produces flowers that bloom briefly during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
