                    <h1>Nigritella buschmanniae</h1>
<p>Nigritella buschmanniae, commonly known as the Buschmann's black orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking black petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its white or pale green labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowering period is brief, with blooms appearing in clusters that emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Nigritella buschmanniae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
