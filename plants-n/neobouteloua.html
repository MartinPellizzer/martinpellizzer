<p>Neobouteloua, commonly known as blue grama, is a genus of grasses native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plants typically form dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Neobouteloua species are drought-tolerant and often serve as important components of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>They play a crucial role in soil stabilization and provide forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
