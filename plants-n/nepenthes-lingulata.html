<p>Nepenthes lingulata, commonly known as the "Lingula pitcher plant," is a tropical vine native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pitcher-shaped traps that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture. Nepenthes lingulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
