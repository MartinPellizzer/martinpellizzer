                    <h1>Niphobolus bicolor</h1>
<p>Niphobolus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Its two-colored appearance comes from the contrasting pigmentation of the algal cells and the fungal matrix.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
