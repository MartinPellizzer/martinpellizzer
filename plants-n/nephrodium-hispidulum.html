                    <h1>Nephrodium hispidulum</h1>
<p>Nephrodium hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy nephroid, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nephrodium hispidulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
