<p>Nephrodium lacerum, commonly known as the ragged fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frayed appearance, with leaves that are often split or torn, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying, and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Nephrodium lacerum make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>
