<p>Neottia nidus-avis f. pallida, commonly known as the pale form of the bird's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish foliage and lacks the typical greenish-brown pseudobulbs found in other Neottia species. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single, showy white or pale yellow flower that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
