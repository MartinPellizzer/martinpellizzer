                    <h1>Noccaea pulvinata</h1>
<p>Noccaea pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Noccaea pulvinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
