                    <h1>Nassella melanosperma</h1>
<p>Nassella melanosperma, commonly known as black seed grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark, nearly black seeds that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife, particularly in desert ecosystems.</p>
