                    <h1>Nidularium picinguabensis</h1>
<p>Nidularium picinguabensis, commonly known as the Picinguabe mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Nidularium picinguabensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
