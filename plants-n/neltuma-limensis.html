                    <h1>Neltuma limensis</h1>
<p>Neltuma limensis, commonly known as the Limense orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Neltuma limensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
