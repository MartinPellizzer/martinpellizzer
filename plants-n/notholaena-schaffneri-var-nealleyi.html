                    <h1>Notholaena schaffneri var. nealleyi</h1>
<p>Notholaena schaffneri var. nealleyi, commonly known as Schaffner's fern, is a variant of the genus Notholaena, which belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form of Notholaena schaffneri, particularly in frond structure and spore morphology.</p>
