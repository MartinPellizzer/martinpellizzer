                    <h1>Neocalyptrocalyx maroniensis</h1>
<p>Neocalyptrocalyx maroniensis, commonly known as the Congo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized, leaf-like appendages called indusia.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and pollution.</p>
