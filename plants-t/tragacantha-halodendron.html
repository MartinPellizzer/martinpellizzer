                    <h1>Tragacantha halodendron</h1>
<p>Tragacantha halodendron, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a touch of color to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Tragacantha halodendron is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
