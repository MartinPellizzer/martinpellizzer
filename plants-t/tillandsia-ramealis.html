<p>Tillandsia ramealis, commonly known as the silver rosette tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant forms a dense, silver-gray rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
