<p>Tamarix gallica subsp.</p>
<p>nilotica, commonly known as the white tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces compact clusters of pink to white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
