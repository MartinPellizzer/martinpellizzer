                    <h1>Thrixspermum rhopalorrhachis</h1>
<p>Thrixspermum rhopalorrhachis, commonly known as the woolly thrixspermum, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite and often have a leathery texture, adapted for drought resistance.</p>
<p>Thrixspermum rhopalorrhachis is often used in succulent gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
