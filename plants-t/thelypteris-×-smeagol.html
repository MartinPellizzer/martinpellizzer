                    <h1>Thelypteris × smeagol</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × smeagol, commonly known as the "Lord of the Rings fern," is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris pteropus and Thelypteris gymanthera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique name and appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections.</p>
