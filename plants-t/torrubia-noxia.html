                    <h1>Torrubia noxia</h1>
<p>Torrubia noxia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Torrubia noxia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
