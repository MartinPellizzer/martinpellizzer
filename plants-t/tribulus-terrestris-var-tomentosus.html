                    <h1>Tribulus terrestris var. tomentosus</h1>
<p>Tribulus terrestris var. tomentosus, commonly known as desert spinach or puncture vine, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, covered in a dense, white, woolly pubescence that gives it a fuzzy appearance. Small yellow flowers are borne in clusters, followed by distinctive spiny capsules that contain tiny, hard seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production.</p>
