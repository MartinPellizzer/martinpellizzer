                    <h1>Taraxacum hyparcticum var. hyparcticum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hyparcticum var. hyparcticum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to the cold climate. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a hollow, explosive seed dispersal mechanism typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
