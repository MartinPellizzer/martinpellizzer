<p>Tephroseris integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
