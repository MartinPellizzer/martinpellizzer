<p>Tillandsia lorentziana, commonly known as the Lorentziana air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is widely appreciated as both an ornamental and a fascinating example of botanical adaptation.</p>
