                    <h1>Thelypteris palustris var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Thelypteris palustris var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to wetland and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in size and shape. The fronds are often covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This fern is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
