<p>Trisetum pratense, commonly known as meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy.
