<p>Tapinanthus luteiflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a unique life cycle, with a dormant seed stage that can remain viable for many years. It is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
