                    <h1>Trichachne</h1>
<p>Trichachne, commonly known as wild millet, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of wind-pollinated grasses. Trichachne is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its seeds are edible and have been used traditionally in some cultures for food or as forage.</p>
