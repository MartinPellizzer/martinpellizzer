<p>Trichomanes neilgherrense, commonly known as the Neilgherry fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help retain moisture. It is native to the Himalayan region, particularly in India and Nepal, where it thrives in cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
