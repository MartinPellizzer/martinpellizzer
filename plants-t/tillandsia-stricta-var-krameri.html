                    <h1>Tillandsia stricta var. krameri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stricta var. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
