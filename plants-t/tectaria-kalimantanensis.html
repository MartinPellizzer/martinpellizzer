<p>Tectaria kalimantanensis, commonly known as the Kalimantan shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
