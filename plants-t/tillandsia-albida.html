                    <h1>Tillandsia albida</h1>
<p>Tillandsia albida, commonly known as the white tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves makes it well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees and rocks.</p>
