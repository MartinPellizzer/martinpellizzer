                    <h1>Trifolium barbigerum</h1>
<p>Trifolium barbigerum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. Trifolium barbigerum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
