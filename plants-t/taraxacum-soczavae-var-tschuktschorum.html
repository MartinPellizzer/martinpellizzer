<p>Taraxacum soczavae var. tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tundra Dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a robust root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
