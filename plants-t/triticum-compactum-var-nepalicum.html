                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. nepalicum</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. nepalicum, commonly known as the Nepalese dwarf wheat, is a small-grained grass species native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, sturdy stalks, which make it well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for use in breeding programs for hardiness and resilience.</p>
