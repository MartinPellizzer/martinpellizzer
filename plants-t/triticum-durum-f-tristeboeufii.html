                    <h1>Triticum durum f. tristeboeufii</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. tristeboeufii, commonly known as the tristeboeufii form of durum wheat, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It exhibits a distinct growth habit compared to standard durum wheat, often showing reduced plant height and altered spike morphology. The plant possesses a compact inflorescence with shorter rachis segments and fewer spikelets, which are typically more densely arranged. Its leaves are usually narrower and more erect, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions.</p>
