                    <h1>Taraxacum spinulosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>The spiny leaves and unique morphology make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species.</p>
