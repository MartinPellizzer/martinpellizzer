                    <h1>Tilia gigantea</h1>
<p>Tilia gigantea, commonly known as the giant linden, is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 8 to 12 inches in diameter, and its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The giant linden is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
