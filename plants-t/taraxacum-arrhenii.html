                    <h1>Taraxacum arrhenii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum arrhenii, commonly known as the male dandelion, is a rare and unique species of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its male flowers, which lack the female reproductive structures found in typical dandelions. This plant is typically found in specific habitats, such as dry, sandy soils, and is often associated with open, disturbed areas. Its flowers are yellow and form a single composite head, similar to other dandelions, but it does not produce the characteristic seed puffs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Taraxacum arrhenii is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
