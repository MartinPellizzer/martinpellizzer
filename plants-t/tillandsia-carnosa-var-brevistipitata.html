                    <h1>Tillandsia carnosa var. brevistipitata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carnosa var. brevistipitata, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique ability to grow without soil.</p>
