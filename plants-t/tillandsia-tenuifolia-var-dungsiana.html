<p>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. dungsiana, commonly known as the Dung's slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it collect moisture from the air. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink, appearing at the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to its environment, requiring minimal soil and relying on atmospheric humidity for nourishment.</p>
