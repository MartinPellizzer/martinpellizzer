<p>Tibetiodes glandulosa, commonly known as the Tibetan glandular bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually hairy and glandular, which helps in reducing water loss and protecting against intense sunlight.</p>
