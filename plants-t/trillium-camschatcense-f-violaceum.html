                    <h1>Trillium camschatcense f. violaceum</h1>
<p>Trillium camschatcense f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking botanical variant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>This fern-like perennial features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with three white petals and three violet sepals, creating a striking contrast. It blooms in early spring, often before its leaves are fully unfurled, and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
