                    <h1>Tamarix dubia</h1>
<p>Tamarix dubia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix dubia is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
