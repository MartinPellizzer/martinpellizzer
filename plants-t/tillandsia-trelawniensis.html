                    <h1>Tillandsia trelawniensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia trelawniensis, commonly known as the Trelawny's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia trelawniensis is adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
