<p>Triticum pseudocaninum, commonly known as the wild wheat or goatgrass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains. It is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it plays a role in agricultural research and conservation efforts.</p>
