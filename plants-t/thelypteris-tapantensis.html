<p>Thelypteris tapantensis, commonly known as the Tapanté fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30–60 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris tapantensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
