                    <h1>Tillandsia multiflora var. typica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia multiflora var. typica, commonly known as the silver veldt grass, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
