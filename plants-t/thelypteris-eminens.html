<p>Thelypteris eminens, commonly known as the tall water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant is often found in wet, shaded environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris eminens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist conditions.</p>
