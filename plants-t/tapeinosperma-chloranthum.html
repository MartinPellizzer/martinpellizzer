<p>Tapeinosperma chloranthum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chloranthaceae, which is characterized by its primitive floral structures and often aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits due to their persistent calyx.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with features such as succulent stems and deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
