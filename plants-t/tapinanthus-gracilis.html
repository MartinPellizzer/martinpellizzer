                    <h1>Tapinanthus gracilis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, leafless stem that allows it to cling to its host. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on various species of legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
