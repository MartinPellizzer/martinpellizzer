                    <h1>Taraxacum semiglobosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum semiglobosum, commonly known as the globe dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster. The plant produces a single, rounded flower head that transitions into a spherical seed sphere, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
