<p>Tillandsia xiphioides var. arequitae, commonly known as the Arequipa air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
