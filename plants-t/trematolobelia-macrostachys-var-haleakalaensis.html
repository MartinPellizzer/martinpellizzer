                    <h1>Trematolobelia macrostachys var. haleakalaensis</h1>
<p>Trematolobelia macrostachys var. haleakalaensis, commonly known as Haleakalā lobelia, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the slopes of Haleakalā volcano in Maui, Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the volcanic terrain, often growing in shaded, moist areas. It has adapted to the high-altitude environment with specialized structures that help it retain moisture and withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts.</p>
