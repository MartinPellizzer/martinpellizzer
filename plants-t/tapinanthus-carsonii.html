                    <h1>Tapinanthus carsonii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus carsonii, commonly known as Carson's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
