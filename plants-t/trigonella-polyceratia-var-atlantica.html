                    <h1>Trigonella polyceratia var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Trigonella polyceratia var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic fen clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish soils, often in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in coastal areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh, salty conditions.</p>
