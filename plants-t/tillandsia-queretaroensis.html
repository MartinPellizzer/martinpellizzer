                    <h1>Tillandsia queretaroensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia queretaroensis, commonly known as the Queretaro airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
