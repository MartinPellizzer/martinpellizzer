<p>Tapinanthus natalitius subsp.</p>
<p>zeyheri, commonly known as the Natal holoparasite, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>The plant has no chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, making it a holoparasite. It typically grows as a small, vine-like plant with yellow or orange flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often found in association with specific host species, such as Eucalyptus and Acacia.</p>
