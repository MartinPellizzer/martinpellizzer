                    <h1>Taraxacum vulgare var. pindicola</h1>
<p>Taraxacum vulgare var. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion found primarily in the Pindus Mountains of Greece.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a smooth, hollow stem. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its geographic isolation and unique morphological traits.</p>
