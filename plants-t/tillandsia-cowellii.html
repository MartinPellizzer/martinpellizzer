                    <h1>Tillandsia cowellii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cowellii, commonly known as the Cowell's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which aid in water retention. It produces small, pale flowers that are typically short-lived, and it is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
