<p>Tapinanthus polygonifolius, commonly known as the parasitic leafy broom.</p>
<p>This plant is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in southern and eastern parts. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
