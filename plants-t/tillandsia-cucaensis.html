<p>Tillandsia cucaensis, commonly known as the Cucaensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale purple, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
