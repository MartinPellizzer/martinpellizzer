<p>Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele, commonly known as the "Turban Cactus," is a small, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, ribbed stem that is typically green to yellowish in color, with a smooth surface and a distinctive, turban-like shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
