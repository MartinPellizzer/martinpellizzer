<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glumeless spikelets that bear颖果. This variety is notable for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve modern wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in dry, semi-arid environments and has adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution and domestication of wheat.</p>
