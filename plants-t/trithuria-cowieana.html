<p>Trithuria cowieana, commonly known as the Cowie's trithuria, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots anchoring it to the substrate. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
