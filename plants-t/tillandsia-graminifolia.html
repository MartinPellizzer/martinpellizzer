                    <h1>Tillandsia graminifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>Tillandsia graminifolia is native to Central and South America, where it often grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
