<p>Triticum repens subsp.</p>
<p>glaucum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential forage for livestock.</p>
