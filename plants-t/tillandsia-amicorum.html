<p>Tillandsia amicorum, commonly known as the Friendship Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically green to bluish-green, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia amicorum is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in humid environments with minimal care.</p>
