                    <h1>Trichostema nesophilum</h1>
<p>Trichostema nesophilum, commonly known as the Sierra starflower, is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which give the plant its genus name "Trichostema," meaning " hairy stem.".</p>
<p>The Sierra starflower plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to thrive in cooler, higher elevation habitats.</p>
