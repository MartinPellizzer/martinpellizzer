<p>Thelypteris scalpturoides var. scalpturoides, commonly known as the scarlet wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red to orange fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips.</p>
