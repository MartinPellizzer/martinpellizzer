<p>Tectona grandis f. canescens, commonly known as the white teak, is a variant of the teak tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white bark, which distinguishes it from the typical green-barked teak. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it a sought-after material in construction and furniture.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this species include its lanceolate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
