                    <h1>Tillandsia queroensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia queroensis, commonly known as the Queroens Island air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
