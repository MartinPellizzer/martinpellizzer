<p>Taraxacum subalternilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a spherical head of yellow flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappi, allowing for efficient propagation.</p>
<p>The species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure.</p>
