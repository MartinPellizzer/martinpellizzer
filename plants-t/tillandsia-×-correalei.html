<p>Tillandsia × correalei, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a hybrid air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup.

It produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
