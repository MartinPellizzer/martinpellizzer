                    <h1>Triceratorhynchus viridiflorus</h1>
<p>Triceratorhynchus viridiflorus, commonly known as the emerald-flowered tricerator, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking green flowers, which bloom in clusters and emit a mild, sweet fragrance. The plant has a thick, waxy leaf surface that helps it retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
