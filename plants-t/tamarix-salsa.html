                    <h1>Tamarix salsa</h1>
<p>Tamarix salsa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-gray flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes.</p>
<p>Tamarix salsa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil and its historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicine.</p>
