                    <h1>Tropidia janowskyi</h1>
<p>Tropidia janowskyi, commonly known as the Janowsky's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tropidia janowskyi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
