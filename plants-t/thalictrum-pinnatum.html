<p>Thalictrum pinnatum, commonly known as the fern-leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Thalictrum pinnatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
