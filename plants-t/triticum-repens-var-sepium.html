<p>Triticum repens var. sepium, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The plant has been historically used for thatching and as a source of fiber, though its ornamental value has also gained attention in modern landscaping.</p>
