<p>Tillandsia tetrantha var. caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and terrariums.</p>
