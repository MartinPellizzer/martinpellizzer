                    <h1>Tetaris</h1>
<p>Tetaris, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant has a unique flowering cycle, blooming only during specific lunar phases and for a short period each year. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
