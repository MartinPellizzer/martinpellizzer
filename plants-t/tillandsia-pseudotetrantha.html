                    <h1>Tillandsia pseudotetrantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pseudotetrantha, commonly known as the four-leaf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically green with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
