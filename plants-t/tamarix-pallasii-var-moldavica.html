                    <h1>Tamarix pallasii var. moldavica</h1>
<p>Tamarix pallasii var. moldavica, commonly known as the Moldavian tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the steppes of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, globular clusters of pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to dry, saline soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and has been historically used for construction and fuel.</p>
