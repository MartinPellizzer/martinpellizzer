                    <h1>Tarachia truncatiloba</h1>
<p>Tarachia truncatiloba, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its adaptations include deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Tarachia truncatiloba plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects in disturbed desert habitats.</p>
