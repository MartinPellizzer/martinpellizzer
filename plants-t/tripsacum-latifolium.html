<p>Tripsacum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf tumblergrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that resemble a tumbler or a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its seeds are small and clustered, often dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Tripsacum latifolium is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
