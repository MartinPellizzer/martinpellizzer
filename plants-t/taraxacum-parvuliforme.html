                    <h1>Taraxacum parvuliforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum parvuliforme, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces a single, slender, yellow flower stem that bears a composite flower head composed of many tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, gardens, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes overlooked but is an important part of the local flora.</p>
