<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>gymnanthum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head.</p>
<p>The flower head produces a cluster of bright yellow ray florets surrounded by disk florets, which develop into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller and more compact flower head compared to the common dandelion.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
