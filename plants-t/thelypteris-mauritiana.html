<p>Thelypteris mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris mauritiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various small organisms.</p>
