                    <h1>Tillandsia stenoglossa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
