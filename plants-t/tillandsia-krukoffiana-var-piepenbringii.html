                    <h1>Tillandsia krukoffiana var. piepenbringii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia krukoffiana var. piepenbringii, commonly known as the Krukoff's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
