                    <h1>Taraxacum torvum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum torvum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which is equipped with fine hairs to aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator species for soil contamination.</p>
