                    <h1>Trifolium subterraneum var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Trifolium subterraneum var. vulgare, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. This plant is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility.</p>
<p>White clover is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
