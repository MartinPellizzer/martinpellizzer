                    <h1>Tulasneantha</h1>
<p>Tulasneantha, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated spur that houses its nectar. Tulasneantha typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
