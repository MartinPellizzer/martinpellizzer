                    <h1>Tillandsia nayelyana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nayelyana, commonly known as the NÃ¡yely's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nayelyana is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
