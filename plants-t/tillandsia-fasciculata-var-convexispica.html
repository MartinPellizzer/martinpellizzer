<p>Tillandsia fasciculata var. convexispica, commonly known as the convex-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its inflorescence produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to red, depending on the variety.</p>
<p>This air plant thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
