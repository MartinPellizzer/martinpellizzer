                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. dawsoniana</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. dawsoniana, commonly known as the Dawson's hemlock, is a rare and relict form of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical hemlock. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming compact, shrub-like forms rather than the usual tall, conical shape. It is adapted to specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental stressors, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
