<p>Tripterocalyx carneus var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's tripterocalyx, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, often covered in a fine, silky pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
