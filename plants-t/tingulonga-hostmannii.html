<p>Tingulonga hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's tingulonga, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tingulonga hostmannii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological research in tropical biodiversity.</p>
