                            <h1>Tragopogon Porrifolius Subsp. Cupanii</h1>
<p>Tragopogon porrifolius subsp. cupanii is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers produce a distinctive yellow bloom that attracts pollinators. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated compared to more common dandelion relatives. Understanding this plant offers insight into the diversity within the Taraxacum genus.</p>
