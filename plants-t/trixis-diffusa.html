                    <h1>Trixis diffusa</h1>
<p>Trixis diffusa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a distinctive lobed shape, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Trixis diffusa is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water.</p>
