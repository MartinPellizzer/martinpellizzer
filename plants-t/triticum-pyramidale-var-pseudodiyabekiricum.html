                    <h1>Triticum pyramidale var. pseudodiyabekiricum</h1>
<p>Triticum pyramidale var. pseudodiyabekiricum, commonly known as the DiyarbakÄ±r wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like structure with long, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are small and have a hard, protective outer layer, which aids in survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to climate stress.</p>
