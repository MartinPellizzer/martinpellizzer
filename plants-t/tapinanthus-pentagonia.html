                    <h1>Tapinanthus pentagonia</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus pentagonia, commonly known as the five-angled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a highly branched, thread-like stem that can缠绕 (wrap around) its host, often forming a dense network. It is native to regions in Africa and is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
