The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pale yellow, are adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Trichopteryx ganaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
