                    <h1>Tillandsia phyllostachya</h1>
<p>Tillandsia phyllostachya, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it capture moisture from the air. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
