<p>Thelypteris lushuiensis, commonly known as the Lushui fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lushuiensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
