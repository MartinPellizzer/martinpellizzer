                    <h1>Thelypteris costata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris costata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Thelypteris costata produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
