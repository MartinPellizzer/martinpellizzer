                    <h1>Thelypteris × jaculodentata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × jaculodentata, commonly known as the cross-veined shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris calva* and *Thelypteris truncata*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a unique cross-veining pattern that sets it apart from its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, making it a desirable plant for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
