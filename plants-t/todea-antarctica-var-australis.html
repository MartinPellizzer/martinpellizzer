<p>Todea antarctica var. australis, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its reproductive structures include spikelets that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Todea antarctica var. australis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment.</p>
