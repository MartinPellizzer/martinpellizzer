                    <h1>Tillandsia cees-goudae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cees-goudae, commonly known as the Cees-Goude air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
