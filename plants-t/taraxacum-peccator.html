                    <h1>Taraxacum peccator</h1>
<p>Taraxacum peccator, commonly known as the devil's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, puffy pappus, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is a common weed in many regions and exhibits typical dandelion-like morphology.</p>
