                    <h1>Triticum bucharicum</h1>
<p>Triticum bucharicum, commonly known as the Bucharic wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale grains that are typically harvested in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain several florets, which are the flower-like structures of the wheat plant. It is closely related to other wild wheat species and is of interest to botanists and researchers studying the genetic diversity of wheat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triticum bucharicum is considered a valuable but endangered plant species.</p>
