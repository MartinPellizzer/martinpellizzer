                    <h1>Tridophyllum lateriflorum</h1>
<p>Tridophyllum lateriflorum, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Tridophyllum lateriflorum is found in temperate regions and is often seen growing in clusters on the bark of deciduous trees.</p>
