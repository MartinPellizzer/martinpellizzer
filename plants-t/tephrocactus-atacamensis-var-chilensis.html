                    <h1>Tephrocactus atacamensis var. chilensis</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus atacamensis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Atacama chilensis cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense covering of spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
