                    <h1>Tetraplasandra kohalae</h1>
<p>Tetraplasandra kohalae, commonly known as the Kohala pandanus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Kohala.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pandanus family and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-like leaves that grow in a dense, rosette-like formation. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat, featuring a thick, fibrous trunk and waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Tetraplasandra kohalae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its remaining population.</p>
