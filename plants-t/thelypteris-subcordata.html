<p>Thelypteris subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dimorphic fronds that are often divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
