                    <h1>Tillandsia chlorantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chlorantha, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical forests. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. Its leaves are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>Tillandsia chlorantha produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
