                    <h1>Tillandsia xyphophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia xyphophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its lack of roots, relying instead on its leaves to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a humid microenvironment. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments.</p>
