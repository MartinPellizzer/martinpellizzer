<p>Thelypteris cruciata, commonly known as the cross-veined spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive cross-veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
