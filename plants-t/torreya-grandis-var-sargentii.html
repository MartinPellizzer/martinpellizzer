                    <h1>Torreya grandis var. sargentii</h1>
<p>Torreya grandis var. sargentii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and reclusive evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in dense forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is highly valued in botanical collections.</p>
