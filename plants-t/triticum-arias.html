                    <h1>Triticum arias</h1>
<p>Triticum arias, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are not typically cultivated for food but have been studied for their potential in agriculture and breeding programs.</p>
<p>Triticum arias plays a role in the genetic diversity of wheat species and may contribute to the development of more resilient crop varieties.</p>
