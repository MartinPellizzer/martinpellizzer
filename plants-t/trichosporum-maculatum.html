                    <h1>Trichosporum maculatum</h1>
<p>Trichosporum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a dark green to brown upper surface and a lighter, often white or yellowish lower surface. The thallus is composed of a dense mat of filaments, and the plant lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
