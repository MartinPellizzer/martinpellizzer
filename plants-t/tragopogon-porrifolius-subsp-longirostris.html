<p>Tragopogon porrifolius subsp.</p>
<p>longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bristly, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status is based on differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to other Tragopogon species.</p>
