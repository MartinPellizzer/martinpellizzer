<p>Thalictrum majus, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a spikelike inflorescence. These flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Thalictrum majus is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
