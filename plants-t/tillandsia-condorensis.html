                    <h1>Tillandsia condorensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia condorensis, commonly known as the Condor air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
