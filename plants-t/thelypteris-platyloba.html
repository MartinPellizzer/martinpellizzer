                    <h1>Thelypteris platyloba</h1>
<p>Thelypteris platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris platyloba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, reflecting its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
