<p>Thelypteris calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, allowing it to colonize rocky substrates effectively.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely toothed margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
