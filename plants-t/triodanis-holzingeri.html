<p>Triodanis holzingeri, commonly known as the Holzinger's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like pods that enclose its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
