<p>Trifolium saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on limestone or among gravelly habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for harsh environments, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
