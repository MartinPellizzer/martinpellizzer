The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Thacla natans is a carnivorous plant that captures small aquatic insects using its bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
