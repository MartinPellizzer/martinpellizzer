                    <h1>Taxotrophis</h1>
<p>Taxotrophis, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a genus of liverworts characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The leaves are usually small, pointed, and arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. Taxotrophis species lack true roots and instead absorb nutrients through their leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>They play an important role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental health.</p>
