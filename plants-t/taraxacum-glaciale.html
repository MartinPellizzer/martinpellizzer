                    <h1>Taraxacum glaciale</h1>
<p>Taraxacum glaciale, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small, petalless florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum glaciale plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems and provides forage for certain pollinators.</p>
