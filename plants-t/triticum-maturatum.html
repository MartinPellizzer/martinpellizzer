                    <h1>Triticum maturatum</h1>
<p>Triticum maturatum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spikelet structure, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts that enclose the florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a terminal inflorescence called a spike. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the grains develop inside the glumes, maturing into the characteristic wheat kernels.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Triticum maturatum make it a crucial crop for global food production.</p>
