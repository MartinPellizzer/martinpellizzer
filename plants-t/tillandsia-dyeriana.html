<p>Tillandsia dyeriana, commonly known as Dyer's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia dyeriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
