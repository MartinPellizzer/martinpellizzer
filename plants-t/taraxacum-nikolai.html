                    <h1>Taraxacum nikolai</h1>
<p>Taraxacum nikolai, commonly known as Nikolai's dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
