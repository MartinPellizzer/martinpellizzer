                    <h1>Triodia wiseana var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Triodia wiseana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and poor soil quality.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open grasslands and is an important component of the native vegetation in its habitat.</p>
