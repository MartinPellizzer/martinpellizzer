                    <h1>Tillandsia cornuaulti</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cornuaulti, commonly known as the Cornuaunt's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
