                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. larionowii</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. larionowii, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescence and is typically found growing in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard grains that are adapted to survive in arid conditions. It is considered an important ancestor of modern wheat species due to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>This variety is often studied for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving drought resistance in cultivated wheat.</p>
