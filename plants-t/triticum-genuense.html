                    <h1>Triticum genuense</h1>
<p>Triticum genuense, commonly known as the Genuense wheat, is a rare and little-studied species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are encased in tough, protective hulls, which may contribute to its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds potential for agricultural research and crop diversity conservation.</p>
