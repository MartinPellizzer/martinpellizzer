                    <h1>Tradescantia rupestris</h1>
<p>Tradescantia rupestris, commonly known as the rock spider plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening.</p>
