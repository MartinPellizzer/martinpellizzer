                    <h1>Tillandsia flexuosa var. pallida</h1>
<p>Tillandsia flexuosa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pale, often grayish-green foliage is a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its low maintenance and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
