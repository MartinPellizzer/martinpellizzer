<p>Tecticornia pergranulata subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the long-haired tecticornia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features wiry, erect stems covered in dense, white to greyish hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration and maximize water retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
