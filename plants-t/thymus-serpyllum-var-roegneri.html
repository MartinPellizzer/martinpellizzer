                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum var. roegneri</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum var. roegneri, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it both a useful ground cover and a valuable addition to herbal medicine.</p>
