                    <h1>Taraxacum erythrospermum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in grasslands and open habitats. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Taraxacum erythrospermum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural areas.</p>
