                    <h1>Toxicodendron goniocarpum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron goniocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or managed carefully in natural and agricultural settings.</p>
