                    <h1>Triphora galeanoi</h1>
<p>Triphora galeanoi, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in soft, greenish-gray spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Triphora galeanoi is a member of the Cactaceae family and is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
