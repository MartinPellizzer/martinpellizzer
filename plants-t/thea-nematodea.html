                    <h1>Thea nematodea</h1>
<p>Thea nematodea, commonly known as the tea nematode, is a parasitic nematode that primarily affects tea plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tylenchidae and is known for its microscopic size, typically ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in length. The nematode feeds on the roots of tea plants, causing stunted growth, reduced yield, and sometimes plant death. Its life cycle includes egg, four larval stages, and an adult stage, with the infective juveniles penetrating the root tissue.</p>
<p>Control measures often involve cultural practices, biological control agents, and chemical treatments to manage infestations effectively.</p>
