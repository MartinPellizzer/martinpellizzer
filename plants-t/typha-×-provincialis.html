<p>Typha × provincialis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a hybrid wetland plant that thrives in shallow freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that matures into a brown, mat-like structure. The plant plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread extensively, allowing it to form dense stands that can dominate water margins.</p>
<p>Typha × provincialis is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in marshy areas.</p>
