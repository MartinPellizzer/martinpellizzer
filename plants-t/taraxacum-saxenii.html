                    <h1>Taraxacum saxenii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum saxenii, commonly known as the saxonic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a slender, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head with white pappus, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Taraxacum saxenii is often found in alpine meadows and is relatively rare in cultivation.</p>
