                    <h1>Tamala littoralis</h1>
<p>Tamala littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tamala, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to salt spray and wind, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
