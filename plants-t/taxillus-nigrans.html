                    <h1>Taxillus nigrans</h1>
<p>Taxillus nigrans, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on specific host trees for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically black or dark red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
