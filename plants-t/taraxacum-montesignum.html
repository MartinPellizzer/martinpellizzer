<p>Taraxacum montesignum, commonly known as the Montesignan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, umbrella-like structure known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has mild edible leaves similar to other dandelions.</p>
