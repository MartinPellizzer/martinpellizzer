                    <h1>Tillandsia rubentifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rubentifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its striking red or pink flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, making it a visually appealing species.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rubentifolia thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
