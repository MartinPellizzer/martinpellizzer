<p>Tephrosia lactea, commonly known as the milkweed tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to disperse the seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Tephrosia lactea is also notable for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
