                    <h1>Thesium thamnus</h1>
<p>Thesium thamnus, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features a prostrate or ascending stem covered in dense, silver-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Thesium thamnus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
