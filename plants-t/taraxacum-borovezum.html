<p>Taraxacum borovezum, commonly known as the Borovezum dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the genus Taraxacum in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a yellow-orange flower head. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a distinctive pappus, which allows for wind dispersal. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>Taraxacum borovezum is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators and soil stability.</p>
