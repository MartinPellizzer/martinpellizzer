                    <h1>Tunica filiformis</h1>
<p>Tunica filiformis, commonly known as the filamentous tunica, is a specialized plant structure found in the shoot apical meristem of angiosperms.</p>
<p>It consists of a single layer of elongated, slender cells that play a crucial role in the formation of the plant's primary meristem. These cells are tightly packed and contribute to the maintenance of the meristematic zone's integrity. The tunica filiformis is responsible for the radial expansion of the stem and the regulation of cell differentiation.</p>
<p>Its cellular composition and arrangement are essential for the plant's growth and development.</p>
