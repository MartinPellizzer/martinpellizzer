<p>Thelypteris muminmammae, commonly known as the Muminmamma fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a vital role in the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
