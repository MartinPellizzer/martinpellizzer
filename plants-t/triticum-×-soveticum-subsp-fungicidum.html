<p>Triticum × soveticum subsp.</p>
<p>fungicidum, commonly known as the fungal disease-resistant wheatgrass, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique genetic composition. This subspecies is notable for its resistance to fungal pathogens, making it a valuable resource in agricultural research.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a robust growth pattern with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant's morphology includes narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential applications for developing disease-resistant wheat varieties.</p>
