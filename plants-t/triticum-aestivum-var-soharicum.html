                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. soharicum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. soharicum, commonly known as Sohar wheat, is a variety of wheat native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and high tolerance to arid conditions, making it well-suited for cultivation in semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned glumes, and its grains are typically hard and high in protein content. Sohar wheat is primarily grown for its durable grain, which is used in traditional foods and local markets.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important crop for regions with limited water resources.</p>
