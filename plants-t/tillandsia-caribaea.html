                    <h1>Tillandsia caribaea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
