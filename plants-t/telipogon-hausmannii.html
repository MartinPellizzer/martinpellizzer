                    <h1>Telipogon hausmannii</h1>
<p>Telipogon hausmannii, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that form a compact, cup-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves, or sporangia, which are typically yellowish or golden in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon hausmannii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
