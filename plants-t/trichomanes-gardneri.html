                    <h1>Trichomanes gardneri</h1>
<p>Trichomanes gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces tiny, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are arranged along the leaf margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
