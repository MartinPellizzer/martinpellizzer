<p>Thelypteris longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rocks.</p>
<p>Thelypteris longissima plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
