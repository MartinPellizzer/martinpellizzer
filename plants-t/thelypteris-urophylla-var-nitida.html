<p>Thelypteris urophylla var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, which contribute to its ornamental value. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.</p>
