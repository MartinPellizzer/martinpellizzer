                    <h1>Taraxacum ericinoides</h1>
<p>Taraxacum ericinoides, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum ericinoides is often found in meadows, heaths, and scree slopes at high altitudes.</p>
