                    <h1>Thalictrum dioicum var. stipitatum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum dioicum var. stipitatum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist meadows and woodlands in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are alternate and finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
