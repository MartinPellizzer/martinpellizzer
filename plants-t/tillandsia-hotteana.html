The plant features rosette-shaped foliage with a striking silver-green coloration, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It is well adapted to aerial environments, with specialized trichomes on its leaves that help in water absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
