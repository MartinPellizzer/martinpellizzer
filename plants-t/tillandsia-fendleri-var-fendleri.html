<p>Tillandsia fendleri var. fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
