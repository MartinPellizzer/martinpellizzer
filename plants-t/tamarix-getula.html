<p>Tamarix getula, commonly known as the salt cedar or tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, gray-green foliage and small, pink to reddish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and saline environments. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it useful for various applications.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
