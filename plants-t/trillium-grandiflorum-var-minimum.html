                    <h1>Trillium grandiflorum var. minimum</h1>
<p>Trillium grandiflorum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features three heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Trillium grandiflorum. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
