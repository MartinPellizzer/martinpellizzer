                    <h1>Triticum caucasicum</h1>
<p>Triticum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, including parts of Turkey, Georgia, and Armenia. This plant is characterized by its slender stems and spike-like inflorescence, which bears small, awned grains. It typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments and is adapted to cooler climates.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
