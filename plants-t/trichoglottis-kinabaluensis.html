                    <h1>Trichoglottis kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Trichoglottis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leathery leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with elongated, white petals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
