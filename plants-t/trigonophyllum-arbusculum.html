                    <h1>Trigonophyllum arbusculum</h1>
<p>Trigonophyllum arbusculum, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching, tree-like structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Trigonophyllum arbusculum is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements.</p>
