<p>Thlaspi platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-seeded cabbages or broad-seed mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, with a slightly hairy texture.

<p>Thlaspi platycarpum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and soil stability.</p>
