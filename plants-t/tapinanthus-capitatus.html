                    <h1>Tapinanthus capitatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus capitatus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, creeping stems and produces small, yellowish-green leaves. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for certain insects.</p>
