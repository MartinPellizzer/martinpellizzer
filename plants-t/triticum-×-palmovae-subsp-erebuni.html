<p>Triticum × palmovae subsp.</p>
<p>erebuni, commonly known as the Erebnian wheat, is a rare and ancient wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its semi-domesticated growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its botanical features include a short stature, hardy seeds, and a genetic makeup that is a hybrid of wild and cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution and biodiversity.</p>
