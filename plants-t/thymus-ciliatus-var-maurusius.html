                    <h1>Thymus ciliatus var. maurusius</h1>
<p>Thymus ciliatus var. maurusius, commonly known as Moroccan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
