<p>Tamarix brachystylis, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Tamarix brachystylis is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
