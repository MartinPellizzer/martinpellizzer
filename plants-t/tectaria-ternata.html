                    <h1>Tectaria ternata</h1>
<p>Tectaria ternata, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The fronds are typically light green to dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria ternata is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
