                    <h1>Trophisomia</h1>
<p>Trophisomia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring pale green or white leaves and a single, delicate flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it unique among orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an endangered species.</p>
