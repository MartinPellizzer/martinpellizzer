                    <h1>Trachyandra giffenii</h1>
<p>Trachyandra giffenii, commonly known as the Giffen's grass cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fibrous, and often twisted trunk, which is covered in a thick, bark-like layer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects rather than wind. Its leaves are pinnate, with a dense arrangement of narrow, linear leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trachyandra giffenii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
