                    <h1>Taraxacum copidophylloides</h1>
<p>Taraxacum copidophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, which produce yellow petals and tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often mistaken for other dandelion varieties due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flower heads.</p>
