                    <h1>Tapinanthus heteromorphus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus heteromorphus, commonly known as the ghost flower or parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which makes it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
