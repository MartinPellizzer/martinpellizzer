<p>Taraxacum rubrolineatum, commonly known as the red-lined dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves that are tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Taraxacum rubrolineatum is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants.</p>
