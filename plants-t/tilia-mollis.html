<p>Tilia mollis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species, typically measuring up to 8 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is light, soft, and easy to work with.</p>
<p>Tilia mollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.</p>
