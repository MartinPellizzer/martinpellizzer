                    <h1>Tachigali formicarum</h1>
<p>Tachigali formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense foliage and unique ability to host colonies of ants within specialized hollow structures called domatia. These domatia provide shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Tachigali formicarum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting ant populations and contributing to nutrient cycling through leaf litter.</p>
