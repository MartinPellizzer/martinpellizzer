<p>Tripsacum fasciculatum, commonly known as wild maize or turkey grass, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with maize, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research.</p>
