                    <h1>Tilia × viridis</h1>
<p>Tilia × viridis, commonly known as the small-leaf lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, typically measuring 3–6 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in forestry.</p>
