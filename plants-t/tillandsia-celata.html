                    <h1>Tillandsia celata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia celata, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with good air circulation.</p>
<p>Tillandsia celata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care.</p>
