                            <h1>Themeda Prostrata</h1>
<p>Themeda prostrata is a low-growing grass species native to Australia, known for its resilience in harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species. Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it an important component of native vegetation in drought-prone areas. Despite its humble appearance, Themeda prostrata is a critical element of Australia's ecological balance.</p>
