<p>Thismia pachyantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique monocotyledonous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but are instead specialized for attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is often found in association with decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
