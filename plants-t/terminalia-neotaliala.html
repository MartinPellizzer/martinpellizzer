<p>Terminalia neotaliala, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
