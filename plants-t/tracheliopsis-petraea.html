                    <h1>Tracheliopsis petraea</h1>
<p>Tracheliopsis petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces such as stones and soil. It is often found in Mediterranean and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator of environmental health.</p>
