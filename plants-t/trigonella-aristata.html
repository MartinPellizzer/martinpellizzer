                    <h1>Trigonella aristata</h1>
<p>Trigonella aristata, commonly known as the Armenian burr or mountain fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Trigonella aristata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its botanical uses are less well-documented compared to other members of its genus.</p>
