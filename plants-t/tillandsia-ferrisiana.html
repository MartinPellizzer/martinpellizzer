                    <h1>Tillandsia ferrisiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ferrisiana, commonly known as the Ferris's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
