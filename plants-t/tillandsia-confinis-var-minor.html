                    <h1>Tillandsia confinis var. minor</h1>
<p>Tillandsia confinis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. This variety is a smaller form of its parent species, Tillandsia confinis, and is often prized for its ornamental value in terrariums and as a houseplant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity, though it does not require soil for growth.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated by enthusiasts.</p>
