                    <h1>Thymus × podolicus</h1>
<p>Thymus × podolicus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Thymus serpyllum and Thymus praecox, resulting in a plant with dense, aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees.</p>
<p>This plant is widely used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its strong, pungent aroma.</p>
