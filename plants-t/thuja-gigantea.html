<p>Thuja gigantea, commonly known as the giant arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and dense, scale-like foliage that turns a rich gold in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is composed of flattened, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and emit a pleasant, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Thuja gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
