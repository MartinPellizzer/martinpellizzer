                    <h1>Tillandsia simplex</h1>
<p>Tillandsia simplex, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that store water and help reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale pink, and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia simplex is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
