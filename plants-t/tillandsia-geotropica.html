                    <h1>Tillandsia geotropica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia geotropica, commonly known as the mountain air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
