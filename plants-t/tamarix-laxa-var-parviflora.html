                    <h1>Tamarix laxa var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Tamarix laxa var. parviflora, commonly known as the desert rose or parviflora tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in compact clusters during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions.</p>
