                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. hordeiforme</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. hordeiforme, commonly known as the barley wheat or false barley, is a variant of wheat that exhibits characteristics similar to barley.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological traits that bridge the features of wheat and barley.</p>
