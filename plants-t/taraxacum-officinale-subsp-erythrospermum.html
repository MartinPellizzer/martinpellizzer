<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seeded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of this subspecies is its bright red seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus of feathery bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is also a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
