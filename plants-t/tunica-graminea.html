<p>Tunica graminea, commonly known as the grass sheath, is a specialized layer of cells found in the stems of grasses.</p>
<p>This tissue forms a protective outer covering that helps prevent water loss and mechanical damage. It is composed primarily of tightly packed, elongated cells with thickened walls. The tunica graminea plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and resilience of grass plants.</p>
<p>Its unique cellular arrangement contributes to the characteristic flexibility and strength of grass stems.</p>
