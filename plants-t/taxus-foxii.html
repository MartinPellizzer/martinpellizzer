                    <h1>Taxus foxii</h1>
<p>Taxus foxii, commonly known as the Fox's yew, is a rare and endangered species native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive, twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Taxus foxii is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
