This variant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
