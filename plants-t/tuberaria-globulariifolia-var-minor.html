                    <h1>Tuberaria globulariifolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Tuberaria globulariifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf globular lichen, is a rare and delicate lichen species characterized by its compact, globular growth form.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, rounded colonies on rock surfaces, especially in humid and shaded environments. The plant's thallus is crust-like, with a smooth, often glossy surface that can vary in color from pale yellow to orange. It is primarily found in temperate regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and is often used in ecological studies.</p>
