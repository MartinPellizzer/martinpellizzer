                    <h1>Terpsichore monosora</h1>
<p>Terpsichore monosora, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it has a unique reproductive system that involves mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
