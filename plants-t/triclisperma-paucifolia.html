                    <h1>Triclisperma paucifolia</h1>
<p>Triclisperma paucifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved triclisperma, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a sparse pattern. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense heads, making it visually distinct.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
