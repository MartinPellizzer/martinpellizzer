<p>Thelypteris nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate and absorb moisture.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens.</p>
