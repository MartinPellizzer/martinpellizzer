<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a single, bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical, spiky seed ball known as a pappus. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Taraxacum nigricans is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
