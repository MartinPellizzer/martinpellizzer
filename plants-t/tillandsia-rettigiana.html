                    <h1>Tillandsia rettigiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rettigiana, commonly known as the Rettig's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
