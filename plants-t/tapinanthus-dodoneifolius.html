                    <h1>Tapinanthus dodoneifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus dodoneifolius, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, green leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. It is native to Africa and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental flowers make it a subject of both botanical interest and ecological study.</p>
