                    <h1>Tapinanthus proteicola</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus proteicola, commonly known as the Cape mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as proteas, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that attract pollinators like birds and insects. Its berries are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus proteicola plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
