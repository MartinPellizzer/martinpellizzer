<p>Trapa natans var. quadricaudata, commonly known as the four-tailed water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive four-lobed seed pods. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps it float.</p>
<p>The four-tailed water shield plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
