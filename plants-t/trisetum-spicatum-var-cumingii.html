<p>Trisetum spicatum var. cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, compact cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural use in wetland gardens.</p>
