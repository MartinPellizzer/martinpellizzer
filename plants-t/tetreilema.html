                    <h1>Tetreilema</h1>
<p>Tetreilema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to certain regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that often appear in a ghostly, translucent form. The plant relies on specific host trees for its survival, typically growing as an epiphyte. Its botanical features include a short, fleshy stem and small, white or pale green flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Tetreilema is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
