<p>Tridactylina, commonly known as the three-toed fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that resemble the fingers of a hand, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, intricate fronds are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, carpet-like growth.</p>
<p>Tridactylina plays an important ecological role in humid forest ecosystems by contributing to the understory vegetation and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
