<p>Tristellateia goudotii, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. This plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals and a delicate, almost ethereal structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
