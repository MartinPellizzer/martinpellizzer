                    <h1>Thrasya granitica</h1>
<p>Thrasya granitica, commonly known as the granite thrasya, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Thrasya granitica is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
