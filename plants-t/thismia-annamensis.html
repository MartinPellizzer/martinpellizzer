<p>Thismia annamensis, commonly known as the Annam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces small, white, lantern-like flowers that emit a faint, sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments within forest understories, often growing on decaying wood or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
