<p>Trapa quadricornis, commonly known as the four-horned water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-pointed nut, which is covered in a spiky, fibrous husk. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Its leaves are floating and have a broad, rounded shape, while its roots anchor it in the sediment.</p>
<p>Trapa quadricornis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
