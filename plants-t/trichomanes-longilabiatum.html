                    <h1>Trichomanes longilabiatum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes longilabiatum, commonly known as the long-labiated holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a distinctive shape and finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
