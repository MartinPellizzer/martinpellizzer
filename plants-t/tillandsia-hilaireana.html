<p>Tillandsia hilaireana, commonly known as the Hilaire's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>

The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help retain moisture. It produces striking inflorescences with bright purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
