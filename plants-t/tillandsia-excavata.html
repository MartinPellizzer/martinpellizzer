                    <h1>Tillandsia excavata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia excavata, commonly known as the "Cup-leaved Air Plant," is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are uniquely shaped, forming a rosette that collects water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Tillandsia excavata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
