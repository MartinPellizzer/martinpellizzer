                    <h1>Trichomanes caespifrons</h1>
<p>Trichomanes caespifrons, commonly known as the cushion fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a compact, low-growing habit with dense, overlapping fronds that form a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
