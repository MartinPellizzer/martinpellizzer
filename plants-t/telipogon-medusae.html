                    <h1>Telipogon medusae</h1>
<p>Telipogon medusae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a unique structure called a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Telipogon medusae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
