                    <h1>Trichopilia oicophyllax</h1>
<p>Trichopilia oicophyllax, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, star-shaped formations along the fronds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare plant species.</p>
