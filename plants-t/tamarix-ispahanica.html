                    <h1>Tamarix ispahanica</h1>
<p>Tamarix ispahanica, commonly known as the Persian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often branched stems that are covered with small, scale-like leaves, reducing water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix ispahanica is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
