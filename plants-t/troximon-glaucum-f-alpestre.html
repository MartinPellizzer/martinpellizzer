                    <h1>Troximon glaucum f. alpestre</h1>
<p>Troximon glaucum f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine glaucous troximon, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the short growing season of its alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
