<p>Trisetum nivosum, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a frost-like appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetum nivosum is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
