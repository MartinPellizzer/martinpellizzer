                    <h1>Tectaria plantaginea</h1>
<p>Tectaria plantaginea, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 50 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
