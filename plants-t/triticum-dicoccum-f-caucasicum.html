                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum f. caucasicum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum f. caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat with a rich genetic diversity.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hardy grains that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including those that are less fertile. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that contain multiple florets.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and nutritional content.</p>
