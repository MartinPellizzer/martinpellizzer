                    <h1>Taraxacum chionophilum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum chionophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal, hairy, and spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stem topped with a composite flower head that turns into a white, feathery pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky and alpine soils, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
