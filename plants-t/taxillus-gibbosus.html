                    <h1>Taxillus gibbosus</h1>
<p>Taxillus gibbosus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can significantly affect the host's growth and health.</p>
<p>Taxillus gibbosus is an important component of the forest ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with other organisms.</p>
