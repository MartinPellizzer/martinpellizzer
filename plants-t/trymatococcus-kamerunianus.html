                    <h1>Trymatococcus kamerunianus</h1>
<p>Trymatococcus kamerunianus, commonly known as the Cameroon star moss, is a rare and diminutive liverwort found in specific tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped thalli that form dense mats on rocky surfaces. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its morphology includes a compact growth form with leaf-like structures that are tightly arranged.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered an important indicator species for studying tropical flora.</p>
