<p>Trisetum heteronymum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and forms dense tussocks, often found in moist or wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Trisetum heteronymum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
