<p>Tillandsia dissitiflora, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>

The plant features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and it can thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
