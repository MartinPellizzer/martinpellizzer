                    <h1>Tapinanthus angiensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus angiensis, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Angola and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
