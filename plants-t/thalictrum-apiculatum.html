<p>Thalictrum apiculatum, commonly known as the showy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which are arranged in a showy, candle-like structure.
