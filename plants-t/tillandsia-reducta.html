                    <h1>Tillandsia reducta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia reducta is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to thrive with minimal care and indirect light.</p>
