                    <h1>Tillandsia chagresiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chagresiana, commonly known as the Chagres air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. Its flowering stems produce showy, violet-colored bracts that enclose small, white flowers.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments by relying on atmospheric humidity for hydration.</p>
