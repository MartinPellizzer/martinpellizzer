                    <h1>Tephroseris tundricola</h1>
<p>Tephroseris tundricola, commonly known as the tundra saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Tephroseris tundricola plays an important ecological role in tundra ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for herbivores.</p>
