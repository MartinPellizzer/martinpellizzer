                    <h1>Tristagma lloydiiflorum</h1>
<p>Tristagma lloydiiflorum, commonly known as the Lloydiiflorum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through haustoria that connect to its host. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
