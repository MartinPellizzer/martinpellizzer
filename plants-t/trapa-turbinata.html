                    <h1>Trapa turbinata</h1>
<p>Trapa turbinata, commonly known as the turban water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has distinctive floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by spiny, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its roots are often submerged in muddy or sandy substrates, and it can form dense mats in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Trapa turbinata is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems.</p>
