                    <h1>Triticum litorale var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Triticum litorale var. glaucum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand saline and wind-prone environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
