                    <h1>Triticum durum var. pilosoaffine</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. pilosoaffine, commonly known as the rough durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent glumes and lemma.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and bread. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves and spikelets that bear the hard, amber-colored grains. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a cool growing season for optimal development.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important crop in regions with traditional pasta-making industries.</p>
