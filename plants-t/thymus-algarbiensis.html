<p>Thymus algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbi thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
