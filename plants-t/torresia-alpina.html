                    <h1>Torresia alpina</h1>
<p>Torresia alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Torresia, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are long and pinnate, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Torresia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for specialized alpine flora and fauna.</p>
