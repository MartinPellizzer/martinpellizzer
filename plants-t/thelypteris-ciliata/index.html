                            <h1>Thelypteris Ciliata</h1>
<p>Ciliate brake, scientifically known as Thelypteris ciliata, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world. This plant is characterized by its delicate fronds that bear fine, hair-like structures along the margins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it plays a vital role in the ecosystem. The fern's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed habitat.</p>
