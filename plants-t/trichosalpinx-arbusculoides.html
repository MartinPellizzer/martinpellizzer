                    <h1>Trichosalpinx arbusculoides</h1>
<p>Trichosalpinx arbusculoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red sandalwood tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
