<p>Tillaea aquatica var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate watercress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar structural and physiological traits.</p>
