                    <h1>Trianthema salarium</h1>
<p>Trianthema salarium, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly adaptable, enabling it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Trianthema salarium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
