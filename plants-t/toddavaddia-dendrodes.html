                    <h1>Toddavaddia dendrodes</h1>
<p>Toddavaddia dendrodes, commonly known as the tree-like dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It forms dense, yellowish or reddish growths on the stems of its host, often causing significant damage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
