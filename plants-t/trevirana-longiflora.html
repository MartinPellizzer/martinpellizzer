                    <h1>Trevirana longiflora</h1>
<p>Trevirana longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered trevirana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. Trevirana longiflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires cool, moist conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
