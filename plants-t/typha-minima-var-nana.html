<p>Typha minima var. nana, commonly known as dwarf cattail, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. This variant is shorter than the typical cattail, with a height of around 30 to 60 centimeters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
