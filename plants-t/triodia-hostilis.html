                    <h1>Triodia hostilis</h1>
<p>Triodia hostilis, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and sharp, spiny leaves that provide protection against herbivory. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming extensive mats that stabilize sandy soils. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds enable it to colonize disturbed or barren areas effectively.</p>
<p>Triodia hostilis plays a crucial role in maintaining soil structure and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
