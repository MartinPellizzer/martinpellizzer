<p>Tribulus littoralis, commonly known as sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and other temperate areas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in salty, sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by slender, creeping stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to withstand saltwater exposure.</p>
