                    <h1>Tragacantha emarginata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha emarginata, commonly known as the Persian gum or tamarisk, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, sticky pods containing seeds. Its latex sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha emarginata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ecological and economic significance.</p>
