                    <h1>Taraxacum neuolobum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum neuolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus of fine hairs that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across North America.</p>
<p>Taraxacum neuolobum is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
