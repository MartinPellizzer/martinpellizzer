                    <h1>Tunica cypria</h1>
<p>Tunica cypria, commonly known as the Cyprus tunica, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a thick, waxy cuticle to adapt to arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Tunica cypria is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
