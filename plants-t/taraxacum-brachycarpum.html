                    <h1>Taraxacum brachycarpum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-seeded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous tiny, parachute-like seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed but plays a role in pollination and soil stabilization.</p>
