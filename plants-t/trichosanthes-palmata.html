<p>Trichosanthes palmata, commonly known as the palmate snake gourd, is a vine species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts certain pollinators. Its fruit is a long, slender, green to orange gourd that matures over several months.</p>
<p>Trichosanthes palmata is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though it requires a warm, humid climate to thrive.</p>
