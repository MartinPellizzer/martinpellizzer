                    <h1>Tragopogon × neohybridus</h1>
<p>Tragopogon × neohybridus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Tragopogon dubius and Tragopogon porrifolius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, tufted flowering head. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.</p>
<p>Tragopogon × neohybridus is an example of rapid evolutionary change through hybridization, showcasing the dynamic nature of plant speciation.</p>
