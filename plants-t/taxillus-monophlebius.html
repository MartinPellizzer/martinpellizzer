                    <h1>Taxillus monophlebius</h1>
<p>Taxillus monophlebius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of other trees, particularly those in the genus *Pongamia*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into structures called haustoria that penetrate the host plant's tissues. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a pest in forestry and agriculture.</p>
