                    <h1>Tetrapterocarpon</h1>
<p>Tetrapterocarpon, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and is used in traditional medicine and incense. Tetrapterocarpon species typically grow as small trees or shrubs, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, several species within this genus are now considered threatened or endangered.</p>
