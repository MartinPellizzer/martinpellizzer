<p>Taraxacum palustre var. udum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, typical of the dandelion genus. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive pappus of bristles that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
