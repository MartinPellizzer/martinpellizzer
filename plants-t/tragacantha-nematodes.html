                    <h1>Tragacantha nematodes</h1>
<p>Tragacantha nematodes, commonly known as milkweed nematodes, are microscopic worms that parasitize the roots of milkweed plants.</p>
<p>These nematodes belong to the family Tylenchidae and are often found in the soil surrounding the roots of Asclepias species. They feed on the plant's root tissues, which can lead to reduced growth and vitality in the host plant. While they are not typically a major threat to the plant's survival, their presence can affect the plant's ability to absorb nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Tragacantha nematodes are an important part of the ecological interactions within milkweed habitats.</p>
