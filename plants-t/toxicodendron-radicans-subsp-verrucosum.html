<p>Toxicodendron radicans subsp.</p>
<p>verrucosum, commonly known as the Southern Poison Ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine or shrub that can grow up to 15 feet in length, with opposite, trifoliate leaves that have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of urushiol oil in its leaves, stems, and roots, which causes severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly common in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
