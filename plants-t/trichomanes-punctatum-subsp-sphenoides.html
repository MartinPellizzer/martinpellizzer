<p>Trichomanes punctatum subsp.</p>
<p>sphenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The subspecies sphenoides is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific habitat preferences compared to other subspecies of Trichomanes punctatum.</p>
