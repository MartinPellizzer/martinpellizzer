<p>Trifolium filiforme var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three narrowly elliptic leaflets, which are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate foliage and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
