<p>Tonningia arachnodea, commonly known as the spider plant or air plant, is a type of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white, powdery coating called trichomes. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences that bear small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to absorb moisture from the air, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
