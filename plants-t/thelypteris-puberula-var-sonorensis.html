                    <h1>Thelypteris puberula var. sonorensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris puberula var. sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with fine, short hairs. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
