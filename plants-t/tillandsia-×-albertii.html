                    <h1>Tillandsia × albertii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × albertii, commonly known as the Albert's air plant, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
