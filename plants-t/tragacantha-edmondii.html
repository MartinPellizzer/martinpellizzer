<p>Tragacantha edmondii, commonly known as the Edmond's tragacanth, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces a viscous gum, similar to tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicinal and industrial applications. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
