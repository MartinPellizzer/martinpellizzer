                    <h1>Taraxacum lutescens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, yellowish-green leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, golden-yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
