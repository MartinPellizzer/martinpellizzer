<p>Tillandsia witeckii, commonly known as the Witeck's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and care requirements, it is a popular choice among air plant enthusiasts.</p>
