<p>Tectaria seramensis, commonly known as the Seram shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Indonesian island of Seram. The plant is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Tectaria seramensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
