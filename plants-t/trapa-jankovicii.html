                    <h1>Trapa jankovicii</h1>
<p>Trapa jankovicii, commonly known as the JankoviÄ‡'s water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euryalaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, bony shell, which helps protect them until they are ready to germinate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trapa jankovicii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
