                    <h1>Tripodanthus ligustrinus</h1>
<p>Tripodanthus ligustrinus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, multi-branched structure with gray-green foliage that is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in arid ecosystems.</p>
