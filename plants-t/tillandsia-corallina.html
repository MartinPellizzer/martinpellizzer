                    <h1>Tillandsia corallina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia corallina, commonly known as the coral tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped structure composed of dense, overlapping leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are typically pink or red, are showy and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
