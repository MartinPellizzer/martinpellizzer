                    <h1>Tillandsia sanctae-crucis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Cross of Christ airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom from a central stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
