<p>Triodia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is well adapted to sandy, saline soils. The plant forms extensive tussocks that stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal environments.</p>
<p>Triodia litoralis plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>
