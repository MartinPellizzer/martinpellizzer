                    <h1>Tidestromia lanuginosa var. carnosa</h1>
<p>Tidestromia lanuginosa var. carnosa, commonly known as the woolly tidestromia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
