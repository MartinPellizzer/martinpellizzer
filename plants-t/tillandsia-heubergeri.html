                    <h1>Tillandsia heubergeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia heubergeri, commonly known as the Heuberger's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia heubergeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
