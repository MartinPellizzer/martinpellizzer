<p>Thrixa hirta, commonly known as the woolly thrixa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Thrixa hirta is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, soft-textured appearance.</p>
