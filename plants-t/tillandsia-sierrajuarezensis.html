<p>Tillandsia sierrajuarezensis, commonly known as the Sierra Juarez air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
