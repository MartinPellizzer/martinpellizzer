                    <h1>Taxodium distichum f. pendens</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum f. pendens, commonly known as the weeping bald cypress, is a unique cultivar of the bald cypress tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its drooping, weeping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the typical upright bald cypress, often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The plant retains the typical features of the species, including its scale-like leaves and the ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its seasonal color changes, with vibrant yellow foliage in autumn.</p>
