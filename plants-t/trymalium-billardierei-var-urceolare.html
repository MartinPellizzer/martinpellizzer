                    <h1>Trymalium billardierei var. urceolare</h1>
<p>Trymalium billardierei var. urceolare, commonly known as the urn-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like stems that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green stems for photosynthesis, while absorbing water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other native trees, forming dense clusters that can cover large areas of the host.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its urn-shaped fruit, which contains sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of its host, facilitating its spread.</p>
