<p>Tinnea kaessneri, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Tinnea kaessneri is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water availability.</p>
