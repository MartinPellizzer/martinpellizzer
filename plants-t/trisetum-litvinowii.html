                <h1>Trisetum litvinowii</h1>
<p>Trisetum litvinowii, commonly known as the Litvinow's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Trisetum litvinowii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
