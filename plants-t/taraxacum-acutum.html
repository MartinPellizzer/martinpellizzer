<p>Taraxacum acutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head.

It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America.</p>
<p>Taraxacum acutum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
