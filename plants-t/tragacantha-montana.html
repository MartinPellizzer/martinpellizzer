<p>Tragacantha montana, commonly known as mountain tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a viscous resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Tragacantha montana thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
