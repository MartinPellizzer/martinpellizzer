                    <h1>Triticum durum var. sphaeroafricanum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. sphaeroafricanum, commonly known as the African durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter, stiffer stems compared to other durum wheat varieties. The plant produces small, hard grains that are well-suited for processing into semolina, a key ingredient in pasta and couscous. Its botanical traits include a robust root system and a high tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest in agricultural research for its potential in enhancing food security in semi-arid regions.</p>
