                    <h1>Torreya montana</h1>
<p>Torreya montana, commonly known as the California torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of northern California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typically growing in moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Torreya montana is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited natural range.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
