                    <h1>Thelypteris hispidula var. inconstans</h1>
<p>Thelypteris hispidula var. inconstans, commonly known as the variable hound's-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, often hairy underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The variability in its morphology contributes to its common name and makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
