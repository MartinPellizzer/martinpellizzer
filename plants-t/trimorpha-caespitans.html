                    <h1>Trimorpha caespitans</h1>
<p>Trimorpha caespitans, commonly known as the tufted broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often forming dense clusters on its host. It has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host, enabling it to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
