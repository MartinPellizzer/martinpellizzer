                    <h1>Triticum compositum</h1>
<p>Triticum compositum, commonly known as composite wheat, is a hybrid plant species that combines traits from different wheat varieties.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex genetic makeup, which results from the crossing of multiple wheat species. The plant typically features tall stalks with narrow leaves and produces small, clustered grains. Its botanical structure supports both photosynthesis and grain development, making it a subject of agricultural research.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its hybrid nature and potential agronomic challenges.</p>
