<p>Thymus wondracekianus, commonly known as the Wondracek's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
