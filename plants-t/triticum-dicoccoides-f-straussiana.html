                    <h1>Triticum dicoccoides f. straussiana</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccoides f. straussiana, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat with significant botanical interest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that are often shorter and more robust compared to domesticated wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its genome contains a mix of A and B genomes, contributing to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance and disease resistance in cultivated wheat.</p>
