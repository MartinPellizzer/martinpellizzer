<p>Tillandsia paleacea subsp.</p>
<p>apurimacensis, commonly known as the Apurimac air plant, is a bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
