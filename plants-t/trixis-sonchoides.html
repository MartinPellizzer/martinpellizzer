<p>Trixis sonchoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Trixis sonchoides is adapted to harsh environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
