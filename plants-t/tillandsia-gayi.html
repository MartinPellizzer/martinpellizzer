                    <h1>Tillandsia gayi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gayi, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia gayi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
