                    <h1>Taeniophyllum pachyacris</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum pachyacris, commonly known as the thick-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
