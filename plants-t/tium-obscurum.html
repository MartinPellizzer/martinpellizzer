                    <h1>Tium obscurum</h1>
<p>Tium obscurum, commonly known as the dark tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Its unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and hairy leaf surfaces that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tium obscurum is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
