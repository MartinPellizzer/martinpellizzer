                    <h1>Tetrabaculum melaleucaphilum</h1>
<p>Tetrabaculum melaleucaphilum, commonly known as the melaleuca bacillus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tetrabaculum melaleucaphilum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
