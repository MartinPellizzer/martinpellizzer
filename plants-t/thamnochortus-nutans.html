<p>Thamnochortus nutans, commonly known as the bowers' rest, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Thamnochortus nutans is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
