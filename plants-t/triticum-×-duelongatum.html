                    <h1>Triticum × duelongatum</h1>
<p>Triticum × duelongatum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a hybrid species that originated from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth habit and the presence of both spikelets and awns, which are common features in wild wheat species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for wheat breeding programs aimed at improving yield and resilience.</p>
<p>Triticum × duelongatum plays a significant role in understanding the evolution and domestication of modern wheat varieties.</p>
