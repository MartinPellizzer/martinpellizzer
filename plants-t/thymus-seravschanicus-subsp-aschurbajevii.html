<p>Thymus seravschanicus subsp.</p>
<p>aschurbajevii, commonly known as the Karakum thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces compact clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
