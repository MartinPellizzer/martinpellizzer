                    <h1>Triticum muticum hybernum</h1>
<p>Triticum muticum hybernum, commonly known as the bog wheat, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>It has slender, hairless stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and linear with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various invertebrates and its contribution to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
