                    <h1>Trophaeum ciliatum</h1>
<p>Trophaeum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale, and it produces a large number of tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
