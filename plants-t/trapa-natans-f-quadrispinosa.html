<p>Trapa natans f. quadrispinosa, commonly known as the spiny water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, inflated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the fruits develop underwater before being released.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
