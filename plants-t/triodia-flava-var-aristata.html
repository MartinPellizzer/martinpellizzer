                    <h1>Triodia flava var. aristata</h1>
<p>Triodia flava var. aristata, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in dense spikes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and land degradation.</p>
