The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions.</p>
