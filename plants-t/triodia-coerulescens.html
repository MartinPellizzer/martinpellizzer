<p>Triodia coerulescens, commonly known as the bluebush, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of blue-green foliage, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming part of the vegetation in shrublands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Triodia coerulescens is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
