<p>Telipogon storkii subsp.</p>
<p>magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent stork's bill, is a rare and striking member of the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers and slender, branched stems.</p>
<p>Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
