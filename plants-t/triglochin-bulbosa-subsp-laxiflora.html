<p>Triglochin bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless and bear small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
