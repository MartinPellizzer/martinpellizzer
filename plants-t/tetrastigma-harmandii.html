<p>Tetrastigma harmandii, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are covered in fine, pubescent hairs.</p>
<p>Tetrastigma harmandii is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its climbing habit and attractive foliage.</p>
