<p>Tetraena hamiensis var. qatarensis, commonly known as the Qatari sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, spiny leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its sandy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is used in some areas for erosion control and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
