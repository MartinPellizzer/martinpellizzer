<p>Tripsacum dactyloides subsp.</p>
<p>hispidum, commonly known as hairy wild barley, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive hairy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with potential for use in restoration ecology.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity has also made it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving maize and other grass species.</p>
