<p>Thelypteris dentata var. buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's holly fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed holly fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and toothed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year.</p>
