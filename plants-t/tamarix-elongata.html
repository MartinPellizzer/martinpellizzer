<p>Tamarix elongata, commonly known as the longleaf tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically found in clusters. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix elongata is adapted to dry, saline environments and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in arid regions.</p>
