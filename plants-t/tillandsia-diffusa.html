                    <h1>Tillandsia diffusa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia diffusa, commonly known as the silver vane, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage, and it reproduces through offsets or seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
