<p>Telipogon croesus, commonly known as the golden lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon croesus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
