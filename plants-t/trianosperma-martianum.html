                    <h1>Trianosperma martianum</h1>
<p>Trianosperma martianum, commonly known as Martian moss, is a unique species of moss that thrives in extreme environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth form and small, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and vascular tissue, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It is often found in rocky or arid regions, where it plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an indicator species for harsh, Martian-like conditions.</p>
