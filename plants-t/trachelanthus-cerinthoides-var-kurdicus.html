<p>Trachelanthus cerinthoides var. kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish ice plant, is a succulent native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey and northern Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
