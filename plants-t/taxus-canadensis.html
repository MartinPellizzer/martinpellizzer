                    <h1>Taxus canadensis</h1>
<p>Taxus canadensis, commonly known as Canadian yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in crosses. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Taxus canadensis contains taxine, a toxic alkaloid, making it poisonous to humans and livestock.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has historical significance in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
