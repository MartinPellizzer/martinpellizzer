<p>Tephroseris integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>vindelicorum, commonly known as the Vindelicum thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture and scent.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
