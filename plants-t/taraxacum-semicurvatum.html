                    <h1>Taraxacum semicurvatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum semicurvatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure that supports its yellow composite flower, which develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure.</p>
