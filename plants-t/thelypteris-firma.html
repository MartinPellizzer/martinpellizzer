                    <h1>Thelypteris firma</h1>
<p>Thelypteris firma, commonly known as the rock brake fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris firma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
