                    <h1>Taeniophyllum erinaceum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum erinaceum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water resistance.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum erinaceum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
