<p>Thelypteris nitens, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a layer of brown, silky hairs, which help in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Thelypteris nitens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, fern-like foliage.</p>
