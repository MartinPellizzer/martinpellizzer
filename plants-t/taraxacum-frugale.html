                    <h1>Taraxacum frugale</h1>
<p>Taraxacum frugale, commonly known as the wheat dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which are similar to those of the common dandelion.</p>
