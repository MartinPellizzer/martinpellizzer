                    <h1>Turnera subulata</h1>
<p>Turnera subulata, commonly known as the desert candle or desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, waxy, spade-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its structure is adapted to withstand drought, with deep root systems and thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Turnera subulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
