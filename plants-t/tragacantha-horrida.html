                    <h1>Tragacantha horrida</h1>
<p>Tragacantha horrida, commonly known as the horrid tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant produces a viscous, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Tragacantha horrida is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
