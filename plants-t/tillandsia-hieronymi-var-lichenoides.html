                    <h1>Tillandsia hieronymi var. lichenoides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hieronymi var. lichenoides, commonly known as the Lichen-like Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has a unique rosette-shaped structure with narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
