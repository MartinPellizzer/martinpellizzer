<p>Triglochin hexagona, commonly known as the six-sided arrowgrass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spikes. The plant thrives in moist, often saline soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and coastal areas. Its leaves are typically covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Triglochin hexagona plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
