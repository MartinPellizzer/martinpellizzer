<p>Tetraria fragilis, commonly known as the fragile tetraria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family.
