                    <h1>Thalictrum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often grow in clusters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Thalictrum dichotomum is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland environments.</p>
