<p>Tmesipteris elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Tmesipteris elongata plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
