<p>Triticum durum var. ramosoleucomelan, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for making pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and spikelets that bear small, tough grains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the stems are strong and fibrous.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate sunlight and moisture.</p>
