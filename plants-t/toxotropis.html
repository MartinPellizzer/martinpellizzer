                    <h1>Toxotropis</h1>
<p>Toxotropis, commonly known as the compass plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with one stem growing upright and the other leaning, giving it the appearance of a compass. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Toxotropis is native to North America and thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its name derives from the Greek words for "arrow" and "turning," referring to its ability to orient itself toward the sun.</p>
