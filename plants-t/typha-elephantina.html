                    <h1>Typha elephantina</h1>
<p>Typha elephantina, commonly known as the giant cattail, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important pioneer species in wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Typha elephantina plays a vital role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
