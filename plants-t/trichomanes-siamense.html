                    <h1>Trichomanes siamense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes siamense, commonly known as the Siam water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, stagnant or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in forested areas near streams or rice paddies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while its fronds float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Trichomanes siamense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing microhabitats for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
