                    <h1>Teratophyllum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Teratophyllum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny teratophyllum, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Teratophyllum aculeatum is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
