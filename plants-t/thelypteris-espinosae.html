<p>Thelypteris espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Thelypteris espinosae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
