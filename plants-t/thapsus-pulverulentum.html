<p>Thapsus pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty thapsus, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely powdered surface, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in dry, calcareous soils. The plant has a compact stature with small, aromatic leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic research.</p>
