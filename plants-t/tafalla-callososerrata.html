<p>Tafalla callososerrata, commonly known as the rough-hairy tafalla, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. Native to certain regions of South America, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
