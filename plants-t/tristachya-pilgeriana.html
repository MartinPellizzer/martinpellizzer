<p>Tristachya pilgeriana, commonly known as the giant reed or Pilger's reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an aggressive colonizer in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Tristachya pilgeriana is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
