<p>Tillandsia simplexa, commonly known as the silver voodoo plant, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia simplexa is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
