                    <h1>Tithymalus petrophilus</h1>
<p>Tithymalus petrophilus, commonly known as the rock tithymale, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in rocky, alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often hairy leaves adapted to withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It is found in specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps, where it grows on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tithymalus petrophilus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
