                    <h1>Thelocactus conothelos var. argenteus</h1>
<p>Thelocactus conothelos var. argenteus, commonly known as the silver-spined cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The varietal name "argenteus" refers to its distinctive silvery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
