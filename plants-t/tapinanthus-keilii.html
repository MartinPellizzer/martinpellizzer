                    <h1>Tapinanthus keilii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus keilii, commonly known as the parasitic ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for both water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host plants.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus keilii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
