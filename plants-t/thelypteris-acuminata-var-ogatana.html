<p>Thelypteris acuminata var. ogatana, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
