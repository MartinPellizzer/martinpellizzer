                    <h1>Trema cannabina var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Trema cannabina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth trema, is a variant of the trema plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous surfaces.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent in other varieties but smooth in this form. Its flowers are small and unisexual, with staminate and pistillate flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>The variant is notable for its reduced pubescence, which distinguishes it from the more commonly known, hairy forms of Trema cannabina.</p>
