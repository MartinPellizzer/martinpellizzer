<p>Tragacantha chaubardii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny shrub form. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its bark and gum have been traditionally used in herbal medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>Tragacantha chaubardii is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
