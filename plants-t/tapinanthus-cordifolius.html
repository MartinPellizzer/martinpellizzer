                    <h1>Tapinanthus cordifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The leaves are heart-shaped and often remain hidden beneath the host's foliage. It is native to Africa and can be found growing on various host species such as Acacia and Euphorbia.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
