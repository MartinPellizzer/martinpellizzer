<p>Tasmannia xerophila subsp.</p>
<p>robusta, commonly known as the Tasmanian tuckeroo, is a shrub native to Tasmania, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and dry inland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
