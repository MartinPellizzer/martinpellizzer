                    <h1>Topobea bullata</h1>
<p>Topobea bullata, commonly known as the bullate lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, warty or bullate surface texture.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in temperate and subarctic regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a leathery, lobed structure with a yellowish to greenish upper surface.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
