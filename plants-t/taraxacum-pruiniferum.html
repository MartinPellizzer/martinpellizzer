<p>Taraxacum pruiniferum, commonly known as the pruinose dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a common sight in temperate regions.</p>
