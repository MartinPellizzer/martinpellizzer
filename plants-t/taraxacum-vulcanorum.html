                    <h1>Taraxacum vulcanorum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic dandelion, is a rare and unique species of dandelion found in volcanic soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils resulting from volcanic activity. Its leaves are typically broad and deeply lobed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its rarity, it plays an important role in stabilizing volcanic soils and supporting local pollinators.</p>
