<p>Theodorea riederi, commonly known as the Rieder's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is known for its delicate, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
