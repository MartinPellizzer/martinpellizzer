<p>Trifolium nigrescens var. dolychodon, commonly known as the black-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to nitrogen fixation in the soil.</p>
