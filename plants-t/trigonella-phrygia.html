<p>Trigonella phrygia, commonly known as Persian clover, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its seeds are small and hardy, often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Trigonella phrygia is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
