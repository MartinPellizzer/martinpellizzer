                    <h1>Triticum ovatum var. brachyatherum</h1>
<p>Triticum ovatum var. brachyatherum, commonly known as the short awn wheat, is a lesser-known variant of the wheat species Triticum ovatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter awns, which are the bristle-like structures found on the glumes of the spikelet. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Botanically, it exhibits a compact spike structure with small, narrow leaves and is typically found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its morphology makes it distinct from other wheat varieties, though it shares genetic similarities with common wheat species.</p>
