<p>Thelypteris serrulata, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Thelypteris serrulata is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity.</p>
