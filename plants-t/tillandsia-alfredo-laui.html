<p>Tillandsia alfredo-laui, commonly known as the Alfredo-Laui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a pale green or white coloration.</p>
<p>Tillandsia alfredo-laui is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
