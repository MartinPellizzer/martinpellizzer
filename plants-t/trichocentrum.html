                    <h1>Trichocentrum</h1>
<p>Trichocentrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent leaves that give them their common name. Trichocentrum species typically have long, slender stems and produce clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Trichocentrum are considered endangered.</p>
