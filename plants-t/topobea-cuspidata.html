<p>Topobea cuspidata, commonly known as the spikeless panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spikeless flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and promote biodiversity.</p>
