                    <h1>Tillandsia guadelupensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia guadelupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its dense, fibrous root system. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple or red flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
