<p>Tropexa biloba, commonly known as the two-lobed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Tropexa biloba is a member of the family Montiaceae and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
