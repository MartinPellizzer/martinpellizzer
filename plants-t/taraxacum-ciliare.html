<p>Taraxacum ciliare, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which bloom in spring and early summer. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly seen in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
