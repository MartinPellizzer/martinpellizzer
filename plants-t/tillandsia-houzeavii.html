                    <h1>Tillandsia houzeavii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia houzeavii, commonly known as the Houzea tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
