<p>Tristellateia stenactis var. richardii, commonly known as the Richard's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that blooms in spring. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
