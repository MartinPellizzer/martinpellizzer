<p>Trichopodium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular trichopodium, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with small, glandular structures that secrete substances, possibly for protection or moisture retention. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral, with a distinctive midrib that is often visible. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it forms dense, cushion-like mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate regions.</p>
