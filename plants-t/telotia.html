                    <h1>Telotia</h1>
<p>Telotia, commonly known as the "mud plant," is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Sordariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark, and often clustered fruiting bodies that resemble tiny mushrooms. The plant thrives in moist, organic-rich environments, such as soil or decaying plant matter. Its spores are released in large quantities, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates.</p>
<p>Telotia plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic material in its habitat.</p>
