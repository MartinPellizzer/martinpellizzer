                            <h1>Tetramolopium Lepidotum</h1>
<p>Tetramolopium lepidotum is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Known for its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive foliage, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its limited distribution and subtle appearance. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
