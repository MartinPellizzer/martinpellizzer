<p>Tragacantha grata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish bark and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in various medicinal and industrial applications. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tragacantha grata is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
