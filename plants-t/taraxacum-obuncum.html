<p>Taraxacum obuncum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Taraxacum obuncum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
