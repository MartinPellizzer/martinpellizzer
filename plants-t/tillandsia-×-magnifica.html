<p>Tillandsia × magnifica, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a hybrid species within the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking rosette of long, narrow leaves can reach up to 1 meter in height, making it a visually impressive specimen.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth.</p>
