<p>Tricholepidium maculosum, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green or yellowish color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its surface often displays small, rounded spots or patches, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Tricholepidium maculosum is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
