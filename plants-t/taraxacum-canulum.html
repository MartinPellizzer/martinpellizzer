                    <h1>Taraxacum canulum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum canulum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions.</p>
