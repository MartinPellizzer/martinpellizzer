                    <h1>Triticum arktasianum</h1>
<p>Triticum arktasianum, commonly known as the Arctic wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the Arctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact spikes, adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, glume-like bracts that enclose its florets, a feature typical of many grasses. Its grains are generally smaller and less nutritious compared to modern wheat varieties, but it holds significant genetic value for agricultural research.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Triticum arktasianum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
