                    <h1>Thelocactus tulensis var. buekii</h1>
<p>Thelocactus tulensis var. buekii, commonly known as the Buekii thorned cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat.</p>
