                    <h1>Tillaea simplex</h1>
<p>Tillaea simplex, commonly known as the simple tillaea, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, Tillaea simplex is valued in both horticultural and ecological contexts.</p>
