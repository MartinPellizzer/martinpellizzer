                    <h1>Tillandsia pseudobaileyi f. alba</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pseudobaileyi f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered tillandsia, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with its dense, grass-like foliage. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is adapted to grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette structure helps retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections.</p>
