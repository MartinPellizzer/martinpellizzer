                    <h1>Trichophorum alpinum</h1>
<p>Trichophorum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Trichophorum alpinum is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
