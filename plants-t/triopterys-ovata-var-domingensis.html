                    <h1>Triopterys ovata var. domingensis</h1>
<p>Triopterys ovata var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elliptical berries containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
