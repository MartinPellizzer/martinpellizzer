                    <h1>Typha angustata</h1>
<p>Typha angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a cylindrical flower spike.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and the edges of lakes. The plant's rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms. Its flowering spike produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Typha angustata plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and providing shelter for wildlife.</p>
