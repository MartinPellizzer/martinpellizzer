                    <h1>Trichosalpinx sanctuarii</h1>
<p>Trichosalpinx sanctuarii, commonly known as the sacred flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the misty cloud forests of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant red and orange floral display, which resembles a flickering flame. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by specific species of bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
