                    <h1>Thismia clandestina</h1>
<p>Thismia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and green leaves, relying entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
