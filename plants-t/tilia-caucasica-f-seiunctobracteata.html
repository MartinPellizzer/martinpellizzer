                    <h1>Tilia caucasica f. seiunctobracteata</h1>
<p>Tilia caucasica f. seiunctobracteata, commonly known as the Caucasian linden with sparse bracts, is a rare botanical variant of the common linden tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced bract structures, which are typically absent or highly diminished compared to the standard species. This form exhibits unique morphological features, particularly in its floral and foliar arrangements. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variability and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
