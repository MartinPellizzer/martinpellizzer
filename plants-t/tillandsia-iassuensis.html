                    <h1>Tillandsia iassuensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia iassuensis, commonly known as the Jatoba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia iassuensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
