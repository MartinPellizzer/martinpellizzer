                    <h1>Tragus racemosus var. paucispinus</h1>
<p>Tragus racemosus var. paucispinus, commonly known as the spiny tragus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, wiry stems covered in small, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced number of spines compared to the typical form of Tragus racemosus.</p>
