<p>Thelypteris exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, clustered sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris exigua plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
