<p>Thelypteris decurtata subsp.</p>
<p>decurtata, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with fine, toothed margins.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
