                    <h1>Tillandsia chiapensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia chiapensis is well adapted to its environment, making it a resilient and fascinating example of bromeliad diversity.</p>
