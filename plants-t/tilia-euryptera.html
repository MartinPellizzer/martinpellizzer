                    <h1>Tilia euryptera</h1>
<p>Tilia euryptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
