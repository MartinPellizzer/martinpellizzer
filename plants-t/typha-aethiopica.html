                    <h1>Typha aethiopica</h1>
<p>Typha aethiopica, commonly known as the African cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that contains both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can dominate aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the stems are thick and often covered in a fibrous sheath.</p>
