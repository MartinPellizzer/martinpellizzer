                    <h1>Trichomanes abrotanifolium</h1>
<p>Trichomanes abrotanifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of understory ecosystems in its native range.</p>
