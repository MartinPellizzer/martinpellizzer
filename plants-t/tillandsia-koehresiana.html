                    <h1>Tillandsia koehresiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia koehresiana, commonly known as the Koehres' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
