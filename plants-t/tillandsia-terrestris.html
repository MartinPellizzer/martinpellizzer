                    <h1>Tillandsia terrestris</h1>
<p>Tillandsia terrestris, commonly known as the ground airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows close to the ground in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It does not require soil for growth, as it is an epiphyte, deriving its sustenance from atmospheric humidity and rain.</p>
<p>This species is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
