                            <h1>Thymus Serpyllum Var. Nummularius</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum var. nummularius, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a small evergreen shrub prized for its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and sunny conditions. Its round, silver-green leaves emit a fresh, minty scent when crushed, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal uses. Often used in culinary and medicinal applications, it has a long history of traditional use in various cultures. Despite its beauty and utility, it requires careful handling due to its potential toxicity to pets and humans.</p>
