                    <h1>Tapinanthus pennatulus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus pennatulus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various grass species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in reducing host plant competitiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
