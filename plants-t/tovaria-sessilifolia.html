<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stem and attach directly to the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Tovaria sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>
