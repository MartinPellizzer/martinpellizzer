                    <h1>Tectaria pinnata</h1>
<p>Tectaria pinnata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces new fronds along its length, contributing to its spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns.</p>
