<p>Thelypteris arcuata, commonly known as the curl-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris arcuata plays an important ecological role by contributing to forest floor cover and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
