<p>Tillandsia ernestii, commonly known as Ernest's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ernestii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
