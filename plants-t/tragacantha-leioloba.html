                    <h1>Tragacantha leioloba</h1>
<p>Tragacantha leioloba, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive yellow to brown resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its adaptations to dry environments include deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Tragacantha leioloba plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its resinous properties.</p>
