                    <h1>Tillandsia borinquensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals through its leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tillandsia borinquensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
