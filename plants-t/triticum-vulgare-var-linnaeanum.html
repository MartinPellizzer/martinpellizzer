                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. linnaeanum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. linnaeanum, commonly known as linnaean wheat, is a variant of common wheat native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small,颖果 (glumes) that enclose the seeds, which are typically harvested for flour production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic simplicity and historical significance in botanical studies.</p>
