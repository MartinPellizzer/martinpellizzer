<p>Tanghinia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched fern, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where the fronds split into two equal parts at each node. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, intricate structure that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Tanghinia dichotoma plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
