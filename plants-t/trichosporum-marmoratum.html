                    <h1>Trichosporum marmoratum</h1>
<p>Trichosporum marmoratum, commonly known as the marble beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a distinctive marbled appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree bark and soil surfaces in temperate regions. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, with the algal cells embedded in the fungal matrix. Its complex morphology includes a layered structure with distinct upper and lower zones.</p>
<p>Trichosporum marmoratum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
