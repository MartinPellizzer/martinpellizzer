<p>Tylostemon kenyensis, commonly known as the Kenyan starwood, is a rare and endemic shrub found primarily in the highland regions of Kenya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Tylostemon kenyensis is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
