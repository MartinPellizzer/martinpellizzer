                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides f. zuccarinii</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides f. zuccarinii, commonly known as the Zuccarinii wheatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a short growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a single growing season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of cultivated wheat species.</p>
