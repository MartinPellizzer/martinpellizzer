<p>Thamnochortus plumosus, commonly known as the silver leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
