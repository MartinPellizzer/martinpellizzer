<p>Taraxacum pseudomarklundii, commonly known as the Marklund's dandelion, is a rare and lesser-known species of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, lobed leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in meadows or along stream banks. It has a taproot system and produces a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range.</p>
