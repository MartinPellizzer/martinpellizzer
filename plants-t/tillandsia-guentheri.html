                    <h1>Tillandsia guentheri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia guentheri, commonly known as the Guenther's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia guentheri is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
