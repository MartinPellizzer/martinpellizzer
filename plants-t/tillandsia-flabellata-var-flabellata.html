                    <h1>Tillandsia flabellata var. flabellata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia flabellata var. flabellata, commonly known as the flannel tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, flannel-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
