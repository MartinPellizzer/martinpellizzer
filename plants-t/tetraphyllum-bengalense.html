                    <h1>Tetraphyllum bengalense</h1>
<p>Tetraphyllum bengalense, commonly known as the Bengal tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm rather than a typical plant, so it does not have botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Cyclophyllida and is known for its complex life cycle involving intermediate hosts. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of its definitive host, typically a carnivorous mammal. It lacks the typical structures of plants such as roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>Instead, it has a segmented body with a head and a series of proglottids.</p>
