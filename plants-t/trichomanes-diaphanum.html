                    <h1>Trichomanes diaphanum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes diaphanum, commonly known as the glassy harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often translucent, giving it a glass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
