                    <h1>Triticum rarum</h1>
<p>Triticum rarum, commonly known as the rare wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a relatively short growing season. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity, which may offer valuable traits for wheat improvement.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
