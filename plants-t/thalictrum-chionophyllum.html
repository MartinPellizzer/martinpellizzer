<p>Thalictrum chionophyllum, commonly known as the snowdrop meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like foliage with fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its elegant appearance and its ability to add texture and color to shaded garden spaces.</p>
