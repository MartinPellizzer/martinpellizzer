                    <h1>Thelocactus setispinus var. cachetianus</h1>
<p>Thelocactus setispinus var. cachetianus, commonly known as the Cachetianus thorned cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its spiky form. Its small, globular fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
