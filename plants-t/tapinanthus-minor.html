                    <h1>Tapinanthus minor</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus minor, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the Fabaceae family. Its small, yellowish flowers are borne in clusters and produce small, round seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations.</p>
