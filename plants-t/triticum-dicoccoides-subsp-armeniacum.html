<p>Triticum dicoccoides subsp.</p>
<p>armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat that exhibits a range of botanical features. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.5 Gb, which is smaller than that of common wheat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust, grass-like morphology with alternate, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed glumes and palea-like structures.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in tough, indehiscent hulls, which contribute to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
