                            <h1>Tithymalus Agrarius</h1>
<p>Field thyme, scientifically known as Tithymalus agrarius, is a hardy perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and rocky areas. Due to its resilience and medicinal properties, it has been used for centuries in traditional herbal remedies. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants.</p>
