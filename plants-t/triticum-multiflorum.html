<p>Triticum multiflorum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
