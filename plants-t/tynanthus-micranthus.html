<p>Tynanthus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree in warmer climates.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Tynanthus micranthus make it both visually striking and ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
