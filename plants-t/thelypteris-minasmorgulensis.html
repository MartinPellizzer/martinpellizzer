                    <h1>Thelypteris minasmorgulensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris minasmorgulensis, commonly known as the Morgul Valley fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Middle-earth.</p>
<p>It is a polypod fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its spores are released in late summer, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range.</p>
