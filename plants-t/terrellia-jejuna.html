                    <h1>Terrellia jejuna</h1>
<p>Terrellia jejuna, commonly known as the dwarf terrellia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which are usually greenish or pale yellow in color. Terrellia jejuna thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in humid ecosystems.</p>
