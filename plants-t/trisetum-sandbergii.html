<p>Trisetum sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's wood oat, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
