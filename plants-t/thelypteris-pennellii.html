                    <h1>Thelypteris pennellii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical structure makes it well adapted to humid, tropical climates, though it can tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
