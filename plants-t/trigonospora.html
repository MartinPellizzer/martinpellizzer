                    <h1>Trigonospora</h1>
<p>Trigonospora, commonly known as the "three-cornered moss," is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structures that often form dense, cushion-like growths on rocky or soil surfaces. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct three-angled cross-section, giving the genus its scientific name. Trigonospora species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they play a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>These mosses are relatively resilient to environmental stress and can survive in harsh conditions due to their specialized cellular structures.</p>
