                    <h1>Thismia pallida</h1>
<p>Thismia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are often hidden within the dense foliage. Its unique ecological niche makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
