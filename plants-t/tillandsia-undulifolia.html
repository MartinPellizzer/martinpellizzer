                    <h1>Tillandsia undulifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia undulifolia, commonly known as the undulating air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a wavy or undulating edge, which gives it its common name. It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
