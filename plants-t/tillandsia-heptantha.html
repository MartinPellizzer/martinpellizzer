                    <h1>Tillandsia heptantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia heptantha, commonly known as the seven-angled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia heptantha produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
