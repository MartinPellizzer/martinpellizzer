                    <h1>Tragacantha argurica</h1>
<p>Tragacantha argurica, commonly known as the Armenian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage, which contribute to its resilience in harsh climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, is harvested for its thickening properties and has been used in traditional medicine and industry.</p>
<p>Tragacantha argurica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
