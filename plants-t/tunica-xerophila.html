                    <h1>Tunica xerophila</h1>
<p>Tunica xerophila, commonly known as the desert shield plant, is a succulent species adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has a shallow root system that quickly absorbs surface moisture. Its waxy leaf surface reduces water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tunica xerophila is native to regions with extreme drought, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
