<p>Thelypteris hattorii var. nemoralis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a variant of the common hattori fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in forested areas. The plant features fronds that are leathery and somewhat crinkled, with a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
