                    <h1>Taxillus bojeri</h1>
<p>Taxillus bojeri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus bojeri is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.</p>
