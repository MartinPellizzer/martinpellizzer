<p>Taraxacum aridicola, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces a capsule containing numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
