                    <h1>Tafalla sprucei</h1>
<p>Tafalla sprucei, commonly known as the Canary Islands spruce, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant thrives in the humid, mountainous regions of Tenerife and La Gomera, where it grows in cool, moist microclimates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tafalla sprucei is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
