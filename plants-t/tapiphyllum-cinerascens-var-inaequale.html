<p>Tapiphyllum cinerascens var. inaequale, commonly known as the variable ashwood, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark grey to black bark, which becomes cracked and flaky with age. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
