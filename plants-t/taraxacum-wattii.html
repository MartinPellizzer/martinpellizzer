<p>Taraxacum wattii, commonly known as the Watt's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, a common adaptation among members of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>Taraxacum wattii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties.</p>
