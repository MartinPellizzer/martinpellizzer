                    <h1>Tillandsia stenoura var. mauroi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stenoura var. mauroi, commonly known as the Mauro's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
