<p>Trichera carpophylax, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by distinctive seed capsules. Its leaves contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores.</p>
<p>Trichera carpophylax is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
