                    <h1>Trichomanes rigidum var. setilobum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes rigidum var. setilobum, commonly known as the rigid harts-tongue fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a unique morphology, with its fronds arranged in a tight, compact rosette that helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
