                    <h1>Tectaria wigmanii</h1>
<p>Tectaria wigmanii, commonly known as the Wigman's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria wigmanii is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
