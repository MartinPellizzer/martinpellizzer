<p>Trillium stamineum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its flowers consist of three petals, three sepals, and six stamens, forming a unique and elegant structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
