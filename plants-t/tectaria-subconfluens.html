                    <h1>Tectaria subconfluens</h1>
<p>Tectaria subconfluens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or soil, often in montane or lowland forest habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Tectaria subconfluens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
