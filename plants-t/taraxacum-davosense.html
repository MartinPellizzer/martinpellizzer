                    <h1>Taraxacum davosense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum davosense, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, with a thick, fleshy stem. It produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus filaments, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Taraxacum davosense is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
