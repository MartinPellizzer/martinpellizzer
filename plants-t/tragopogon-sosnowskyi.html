                    <h1>Tragopogon sosnowskyi</h1>
<p>Tragopogon sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among grasses. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it has been studied for its role in evolutionary biology and hybridization.</p>
