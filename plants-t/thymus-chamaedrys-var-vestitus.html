                    <h1>Thymus chamaedrys var. vestitus</h1>
<p>Thymus chamaedrys var. vestitus, commonly known as the pale thyme or woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, creeping stems covered in dense, soft white or grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered with a similar hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or pale purple, borne in small clusters during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
