<p>Tectaria murudensis, commonly known as the Murudensian shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors.</p>
<p>Tectaria murudensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
