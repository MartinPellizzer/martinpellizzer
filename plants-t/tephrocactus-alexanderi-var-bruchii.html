                    <h1>Tephrocactus alexanderi var. bruchii</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus alexanderi var. bruchii, commonly known as the Alexander's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to the harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
