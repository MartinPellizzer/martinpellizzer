                    <h1>Triodia avenacea</h1>
<p>Triodia avenacea, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Triodia avenacea plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
