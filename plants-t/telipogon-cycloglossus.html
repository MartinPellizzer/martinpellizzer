<p>Telipogon cycloglossus, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
