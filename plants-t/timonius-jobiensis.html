<p>Timonius jobiensis, commonly known as the Jobiense Timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a soft, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius jobiensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
