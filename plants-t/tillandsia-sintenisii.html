<p>Tillandsia sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sintenisii requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive.</p>
