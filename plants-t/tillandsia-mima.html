<p>Tillandsia mima, commonly known as the Mima air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue.</p>
<p>Tillandsia mima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
