                    <h1>Tapinanthus wyliei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus wyliei, commonly known as the Wylie's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vine-like structure and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to arid regions of Africa and is often found growing on plants such as Acacia and Euphorbia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to its death.</p>
