                    <h1>Tragacantha chartostegia</h1>
<p>Tragacantha chartostegia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsules that contain the characteristic resinous gum. Tragacantha chartostegia is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments and for the latex it secretes, which has been historically used in various industrial applications.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts.</p>
