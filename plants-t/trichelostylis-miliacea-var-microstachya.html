                    <h1>Trichelostylis miliacea var. microstachya</h1>
<p>Trichelostylis miliacea var. microstachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed pigface, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, woody structure with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter stamens compared to the typical form, giving it its specific epithet "microstachya.".</p>
