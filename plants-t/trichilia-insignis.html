<p>Trichilia insignis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
