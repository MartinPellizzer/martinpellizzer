<p>Ternatea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, with fronds that can vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Ternatea heterophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
