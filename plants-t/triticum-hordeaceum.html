                    <h1>Triticum hordeaceum</h1>
<p>Triticum hordeaceum, commonly known as barley, is a cereal grain that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact inflorescence, which consists of spikelets containing multiple small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, parallel-veined leaves. Barley produces a three-sided, hard seed coat that protects the endosperm, which is rich in starch and proteins.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and various agricultural uses.</p>
