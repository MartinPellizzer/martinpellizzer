                    <h1>Thrixspermum brevicapsularis</h1>
<p>Thrixspermum brevicapsularis, commonly known as the short-capsule thrixspermum, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy stems and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits that are enclosed in a specialized, bract-like structure. Its leaves are typically alternate and pinnately divided, with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species.</p>
