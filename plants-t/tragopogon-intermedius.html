                    <h1>Tragopogon intermedius</h1>
<p>Tragopogon intermedius, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow ray florets and a tuft of bristly hairs at the tip of its flowering head. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, seed-filled flowers that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Tragopogon intermedius is often found in hybrid populations with other Tragopogon species, leading to genetic diversity in its populations.</p>
