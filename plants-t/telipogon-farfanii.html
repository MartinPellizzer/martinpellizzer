<p>Telipogon farfanii, commonly known as the Farfan's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It has a short, fibrous root system and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon farfanii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
