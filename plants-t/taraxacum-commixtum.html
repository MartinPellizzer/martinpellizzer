                    <h1>Taraxacum commixtum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum commixtum, commonly known as the composite dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and meadows.</p>
