                    <h1>Tepualia</h1>
<p>Tepualia, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their composite flowers, which consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Tepualia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and may have hairy surfaces. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their bright yellow blooms.</p>
