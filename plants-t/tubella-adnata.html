<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure and is typically found in marine environments. The sponge's body is covered with a porous surface that allows for water filtration, a key feature for its feeding mechanism. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often associated with rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for marine ecosystem health.</p>
