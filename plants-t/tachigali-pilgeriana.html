<p>Tachigali pilgeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is valued for its durability and used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
