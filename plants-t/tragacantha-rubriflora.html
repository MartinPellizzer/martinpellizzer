<p>Tragacantha rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered tragacanth, is a species of flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a sticky, resinous sap known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
