                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. plenocreticum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. plenocreticum, commonly known as the wheat variety with a high gluten content, is a type of durum wheat characterized by its hard grain and high protein content.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its use in producing semolina, which is essential for making pasta and certain types of bread. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective husk that must be removed during processing.</p>
<p>Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is often grown in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
