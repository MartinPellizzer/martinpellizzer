<p>Thelesperma trifidum, commonly known as three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Thelesperma trifidum is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
