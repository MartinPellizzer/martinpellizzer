<p>Thelypteris amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer, which helps it anchor in soil and retain moisture.</p>
