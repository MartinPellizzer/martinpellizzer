                    <h1>Triticum vavilovii var. vavilovolutescens</h1>
<p>Triticum vavilovii var. vavilovolutescens, commonly known as the Vavilovian curlgrass, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive curling leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences with palea and lemma structures typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
