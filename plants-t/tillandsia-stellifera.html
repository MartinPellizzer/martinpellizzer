                    <h1>Tillandsia stellifera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stellifera, commonly known as the starry tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, star-like flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Tillandsia stellifera is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
