                    <h1>Tillandsia funckiana var. recurvifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia funckiana var. recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing at the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
