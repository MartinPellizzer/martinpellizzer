                    <h1>Thouinia maestrensis</h1>
<p>Thouinia maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thouinia maestrensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
