                    <h1>Tetrapathaea australis</h1>
<p>Tetrapathaea australis, commonly known as the southern starburst lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, star-like appearance due to its radiating lobes and is often found on bark, stones, and soil surfaces. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>This lichen is relatively slow-growing and is sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
