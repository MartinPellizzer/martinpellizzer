<p>Triodia capensis, commonly known as the Cape umbrella plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded shape with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Triodia capensis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
