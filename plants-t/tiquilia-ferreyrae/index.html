                            <h1>Tiquilia Ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Ferreyra's tiquilia, scientifically known as Tiquilia ferreyrae, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. This striking species belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers. Its discovery in the early 20th century by the botanist Luis Ferreyra sparked significant interest among plant enthusiasts and researchers. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical treasure from extinction.</p>
