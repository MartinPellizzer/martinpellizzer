                    <h1>Taxus baccata stricta</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata stricta, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western and central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes scaly with age. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in shady, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The European yew is also notable for its longevity, with some specimens living for thousands of years.</p>
