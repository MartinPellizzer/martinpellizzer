<p>Tillandsia humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Tillandsia humboldtii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
