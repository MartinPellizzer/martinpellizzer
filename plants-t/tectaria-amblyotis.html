                    <h1>Tectaria amblyotis</h1>
<p>Tectaria amblyotis, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting certain pollinators.</p>
