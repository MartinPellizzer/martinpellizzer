<p>Trichomanes crispum subsp.</p>
<p>pellucens, commonly known as the translucent maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green and have a translucent appearance, especially when viewed from certain angles. This subspecies is notable for its small, spore-producing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
