<p>Trevirana mollis, commonly known as the soft-tongued lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Trevirana mollis is noted for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes.</p>
