<p>Torularia eldarica, commonly known as the Eldarica torula, is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of wax, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Torularia eldarica is also notable for its ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
