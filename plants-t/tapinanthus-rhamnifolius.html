                    <h1>Tapinanthus rhamnifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rhamnifolius, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions in Africa, including South Africa and Madagascar. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that are adapted for bird dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
