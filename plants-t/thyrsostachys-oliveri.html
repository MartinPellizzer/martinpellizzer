<p>Thyrsostachys oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted clumps of fleshy, bulbous stems that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Thyrsostachys oliveri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
