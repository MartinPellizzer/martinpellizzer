                    <h1>Tydaea × pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Tydaea × pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal reed, is a hybrid grass species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a pyramid. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Tydaea × pyramidalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens.</p>
