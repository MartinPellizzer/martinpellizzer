<p>Thalictrum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and fern-like, compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically less showy than the foliage. Thalictrum coriaceum prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native garden cultivation.</p>
