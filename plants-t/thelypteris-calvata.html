<p>Thelypteris calvata, commonly known as the barren wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris calvata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
