                    <h1>Tephrocactus dactylifer</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus dactylifer, commonly known as the desert date cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, columnar stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the sandy soil.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus dactylifer is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
