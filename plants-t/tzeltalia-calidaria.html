                    <h1>Tzeltalia calidaria</h1>
<p>Tzeltalia calidaria, commonly known as the sunfire orchid, is a tropical plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor, rocky soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Tzeltalia calidaria is often cultivated in warm, humid environments due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures.</p>
