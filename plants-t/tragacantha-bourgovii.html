<p>Tragacantha bourgovii, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered with a thick, resinous coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of pods containing seeds. Its latex, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha bourgovii is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system.</p>
