<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, rounded shape and a ribbed structure. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.

<p>Tephrocactus udonis is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found growing in limestone soils.</p>
