                    <h1>Tillandsia cambuquirensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cambuquirensis, commonly known as the Cambuquire air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
