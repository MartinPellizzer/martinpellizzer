<p>Tribrachia pendula, commonly known as the hanging trichodesmid, is a species of green alga belonging to the order Tribrachiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching thallus that often forms a pendulous growth, hence its common name. The plant consists of thin, thread-like filaments that are usually found in freshwater environments. Tribrachia pendula reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the production of zoospores playing a key role in its life cycle.</p>
