                    <h1>Tillandsia muhriae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia muhriae, commonly known as the Muhriae Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful inflorescences with white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
