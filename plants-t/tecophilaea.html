                    <h1>Tecophilaea</h1>
<p>Tecophilaea, commonly known as the "bottle tree" or "bottle cactus," is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, thick, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. Tecophilaea species produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, often blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>These plants are popular in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and striking appearance.</p>
