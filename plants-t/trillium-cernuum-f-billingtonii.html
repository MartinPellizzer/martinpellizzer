                    <h1>Trillium cernuum f. billingtonii</h1>
<p>Trillium cernuum f. billingtonii, commonly known as the Billington's wake-robin, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common wake-robin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its downward-facing, three-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, recurved shape. The plant features three broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the base, and it produces a single, elongated seed capsule. Native to specific regions of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
