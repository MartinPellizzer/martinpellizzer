                    <h1>Tupistra leonidii</h1>
<p>Tupistra leonidii, commonly known as the Leonidii's tufted plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tupistra leonidii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
