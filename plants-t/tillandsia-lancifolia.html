                    <h1>Tillandsia lancifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
