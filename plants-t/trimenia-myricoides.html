<p>Trimenia myricoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Trimenia myricoides is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
