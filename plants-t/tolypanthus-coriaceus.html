                    <h1>Tolypanthus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Tolypanthus coriaceus, commonly known as the hard-leaved bignon, is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>
