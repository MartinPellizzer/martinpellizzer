                    <h1>Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureus, commonly known as the golden-tailed cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, golden-yellow spines, which give it its common name. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in late summer and are tubular in shape, attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
