                    <h1>Trifolium echinatum var. brevidens</h1>
<p>Trifolium echinatum var. brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
