                    <h1>Taraxacum subargutum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subargutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are narrower than those of typical dandelions. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
