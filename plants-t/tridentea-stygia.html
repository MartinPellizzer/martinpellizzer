                    <h1>Tridentea stygia</h1>
<p>Tridentea stygia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of Southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like blooms that appear above the water's surface. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots suspended in the air rather than in soil, absorbing nutrients from the water and surrounding air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, swampy environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Tridentea stygia is considered an endangered species.</p>
