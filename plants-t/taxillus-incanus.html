                    <h1>Taxillus incanus</h1>
<p>Taxillus incanus, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruits, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>Taxillus incanus plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
