                    <h1>Tridentea gemmiflora var. hircosa</h1>
<p>Tridentea gemmiflora var. hircosa, commonly known as the horned trident, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure and the presence of small, fleshy tubercles that resemble horns. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of edible, gelatinous fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
