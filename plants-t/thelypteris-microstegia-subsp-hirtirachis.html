<p>Thelypteris microstegia subsp.</p>
<p>hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender rhizomes and fronds that are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
