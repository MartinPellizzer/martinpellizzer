                    <h1>Toxicodendron hindsianum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron hindsianum, commonly known as the Hindsian poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided and can be difficult to control once established.</p>
