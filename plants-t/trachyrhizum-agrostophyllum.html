<p>Trachyrhizum agrostophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15–30 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is characterized by long, thin rhizomes that help it anchor in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Trachyrhizum agrostophyllum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various insects and small animals.</p>
