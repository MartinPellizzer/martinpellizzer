                    <h1>Tillandsia corcovadensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia corcovadensis, commonly known as the Corcovado air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
