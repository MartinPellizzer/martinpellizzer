<p>Trichera brevis, commonly known as the short-bract trichera, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically features short, hairy bracts that give it its scientific name, and its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Trichera brevis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
