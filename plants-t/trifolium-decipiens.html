<p>Trifolium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive clover, is a species of legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium decipiens is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
