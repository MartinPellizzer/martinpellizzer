                    <h1>Triticum thaoudar</h1>
<p>Triticum thaoudar, commonly known as the desert wheat, is a wild wheat species native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hard grains and robust root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It is adapted to low water conditions and can survive extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is of interest for agricultural research in drought-prone areas.</p>
