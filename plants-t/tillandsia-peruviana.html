                    <h1>Tillandsia peruviana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Tillandsia peruviana is well adapted to its high-altitude, arid environment and requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering.</p>
