<p>Tetrorchidium gorgonae subsp.</p>
<p>robledoanum, commonly known as the Robledo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent floral structures, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter, reflecting its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits. Its floral morphology suggests a specialized relationship with certain pollinators, likely moths or nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
