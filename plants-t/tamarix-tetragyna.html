                    <h1>Tamarix tetragyna</h1>
<p>Tamarix tetragyna, commonly known as the desert rose or saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in saline and poor soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Tamarix tetragyna is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
