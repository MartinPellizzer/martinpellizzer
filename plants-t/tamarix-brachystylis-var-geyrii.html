<p>Tamarix brachystylis var. geyrii, commonly known as the Geyrii tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in saline soils and can tolerate moderate salinity, making it adaptable to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
