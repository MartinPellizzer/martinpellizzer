                    <h1>Triticum rectum</h1>
<p>Triticum rectum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is one of the earliest cultivated wheat varieties, originating in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its spikelets contain small, hard grains that are encased in a tough outer layer.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is valued for its high nutritional content and is often used in specialty foods and health-conscious diets.</p>
