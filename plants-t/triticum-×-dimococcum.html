                    <h1>Triticum × dimococcum</h1>
<p>Triticum × dimococcum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, dark-colored grains. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Its genome contains a mix of genes from both parent species, contributing to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>This species is of significant interest in plant breeding for its potential to improve wheat resistance to diseases and environmental stresses.</p>
