<p>Tillaea erecta subsp.</p>
<p>eremica, commonly known as the desert tillia, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
