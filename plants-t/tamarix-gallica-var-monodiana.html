                    <h1>Tamarix gallica var. monodiana</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica var. monodiana, commonly known as the French tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features feathery, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in coastal areas, saline soils, and disturbed sites due to its salt tolerance.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
