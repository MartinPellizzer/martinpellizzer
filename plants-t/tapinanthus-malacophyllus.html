                    <h1>Tapinanthus malacophyllus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus malacophyllus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa, where it typically infests various shrubs and trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure that allows it to attach to its host. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
