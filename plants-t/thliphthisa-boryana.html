<p>Thliphthisa boryana, commonly known as the Boryan's thliphthisa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thliphthisa boryana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
