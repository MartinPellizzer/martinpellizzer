                    <h1>Tillandsia marabascoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia marabascoensis, commonly known as the Marabasco air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often sought after by collectors and conservationists.</p>
