                    <h1>Tomophyllum beleense</h1>
<p>Tomophyllum beleense, commonly known as the Blesse's bladderworts, is a unique aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes carnivorous plants, although Tomophyllum beleense is not known to capture prey. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and gas exchange in water. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface, adding to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
