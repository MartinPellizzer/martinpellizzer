                    <h1>Tapeinia squalida</h1>
<p>Tapeinia squalida, commonly known as the common rust fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily infects grasses and cereals.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fungal family Pucciniales and is characterized by its rust-like spores that appear on the leaves of infected plants. The disease caused by Tapeinia squalida can lead to reduced growth and yield in crops such as wheat and barley. The life cycle of this fungus involves multiple spore stages, including urediospores and teliospores, which enable it to survive and spread in different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a major agricultural pathogen and its impact on plant health and productivity.</p>
