                    <h1>Tillandsia sordida</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sordida, commonly known as the dirty air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
