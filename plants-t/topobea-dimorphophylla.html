                    <h1>Topobea dimorphophylla</h1>
<p>Topobea dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct morphology, featuring two different types of leaves on the same plant—dorsal and ventral—hence its scientific name. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
