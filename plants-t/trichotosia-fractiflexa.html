<p>Trichotosia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible trichotosia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, depending on the species.</p>
<p>Trichotosia fractiflexa is notable for its flexible stems, which allow it to bend without breaking, an adaptation that aids in survival in its natural habitat.</p>
