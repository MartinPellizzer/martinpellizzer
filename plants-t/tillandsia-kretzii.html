<p>Tillandsia kretzii, commonly known as the Kretzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kretzii is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
