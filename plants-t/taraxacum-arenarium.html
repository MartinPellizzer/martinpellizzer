                    <h1>Taraxacum arenarium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum arenarium, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single flower head, which develops into a distinctive seed head with bristly seeds. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low moisture.</p>
<p>The species is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, sandy habitats.</p>
