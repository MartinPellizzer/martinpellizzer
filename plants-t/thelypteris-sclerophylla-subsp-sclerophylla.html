<p>Thelypteris sclerophylla subsp.</p>
<p>sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery, and often serrated fronds that are densely arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
