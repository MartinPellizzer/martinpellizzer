<p>Tithymalus amygdaloides subsp.</p>
<p>arbuscula, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It features compact, cushion-like growth with small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
