                    <h1>Tillandsia lampropoda var. major</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lampropoda var. major, commonly known as the showy airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
