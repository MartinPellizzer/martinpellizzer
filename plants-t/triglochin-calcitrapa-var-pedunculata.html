                    <h1>Triglochin calcitrapa var. pedunculata</h1>
<p>Triglochin calcitrapa var. pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to trap sediment, which helps in stabilizing aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to the typical form of Triglochin calcitrapa.</p>
