                    <h1>Townsendia gypsophila</h1>
<p>Townsendia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum townsendia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, particularly in gypsum soils, which influence its growth habits and adaptations. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is often found in open areas such as slopes and crevices, where it forms dense mats of foliage.</p>
