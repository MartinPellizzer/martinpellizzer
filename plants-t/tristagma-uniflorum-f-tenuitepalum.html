<p>Tristagma uniflorum f. tenuitepalum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tristagma, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in rocky or arid environments where it exhibits drought tolerance. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
