                    <h1>Trichogyne repens</h1>
<p>Trichogyne repens, commonly known as the creeping trichogyne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on orchid morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
