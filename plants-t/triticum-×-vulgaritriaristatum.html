                    <h1>Triticum × vulgaritriaristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum × vulgaritriaristatum, commonly known as the wheat rye hybrid, is a synthetic amphidiploid resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale).</p>
<p>It possesses a genome composed of the A, B, and D genomes from its parent species, making it a unique genetic combination. This plant is characterized by its robust growth habit and high adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its botanical features include tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is often used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits into wheat varieties.</p>
