<p>Thinopyrum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Thinopyrum species often grow in disturbed soils and are commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.
