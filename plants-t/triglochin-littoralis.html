                    <h1>Triglochin littoralis</h1>
<p>Triglochin littoralis, commonly known as salt marsh grass or sea grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are adapted to wind pollination.</p>
<p>Triglochin littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
