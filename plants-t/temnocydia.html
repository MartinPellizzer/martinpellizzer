                    <h1>Temnocydia</h1>
<p>Temnocydia, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax or narrowleaf sida, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with slender, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually narrow and lance-shaped. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals and stamens that are either free or fused. Temnocydia species are native to various regions in the Americas and are sometimes found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>They are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their ecological roles and morphological diversity.</p>
