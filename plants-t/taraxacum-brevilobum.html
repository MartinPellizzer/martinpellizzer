                    <h1>Taraxacum brevilobum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum brevilobum, commonly known as the short-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a yellow flower head, which later develops into a white, spherical seed sphere. Its leaves are generally shorter and more broadly lobed compared to other dandelion species.</p>
<p>Taraxacum brevilobum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
