<p>Triticum spelta subsp.</p>
<p>tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan spelt, is a wild relative of common wheat native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial grass with slender, tufted culms and spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a C3 photosynthetic pathway, typical of temperate grasses, and thrives in cool, arid environments. Its genetic diversity offers potential for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to climate stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and underutilized crop species.</p>
