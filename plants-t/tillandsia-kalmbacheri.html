                    <h1>Tillandsia kalmbacheri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kalmbacheri, commonly known as the Kalmbacher air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kalmbacheri is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
