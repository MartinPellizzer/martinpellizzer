                    <h1>Trifolium caespitosum</h1>
<p>Trifolium caespitosum, commonly known as creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground.</p>
<p>Trifolium caespitosum is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
