<p>Trapa acicularis, commonly known as the spiny water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, woody fruits that resemble chestnuts. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with the fruits detaching and floating to new locations.</p>
<p>Trapa acicularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
