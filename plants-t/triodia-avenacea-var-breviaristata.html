<p>Triodia avenacea var. breviaristata, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a hardy component of coastal and inland grasslands.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaf blades compared to other variants of Triodia avenacea.</p>
