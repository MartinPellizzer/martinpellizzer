                    <h1>Thelypteris pauciserrata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris pauciserrata, commonly known as the few-toothed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
