                    <h1>Triticum thaoudar var. reuteri</h1>
<p>Triticum thaoudar var. reuteri, commonly known as the Syrian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its grains are smaller than those of common wheat and have a distinct, sometimes bitter taste.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to researchers for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to climate change.</p>
