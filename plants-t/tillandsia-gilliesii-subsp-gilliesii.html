<p>Tillandsia gilliesii subsp.</p>
<p>gilliesii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
