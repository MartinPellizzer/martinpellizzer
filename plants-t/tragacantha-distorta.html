                    <h1>Tragacantha distorta</h1>
<p>Tragacantha distorta, commonly known as the twisted tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, twisted stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a gum-like substance, which can be harvested from its stems, though it is less commercially valuable than other tragacanth species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
