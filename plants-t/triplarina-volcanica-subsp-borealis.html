<p>Triplarina volcanica subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the Northern Volcanic Triplarina, is a rare shrub native to high-altitude regions of the northern Andes. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct aromatic scent, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
