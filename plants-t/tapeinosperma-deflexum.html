<p>Tapeinosperma deflexum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Tapeinosperma deflexum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
