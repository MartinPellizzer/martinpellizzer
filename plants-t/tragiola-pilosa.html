<p>Tragiola pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tragi, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragiola pilosa is often found growing in rocky soils and along the edges of deserts.</p>
<p>It is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
