                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. sparsifolia</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparse-foliage Canadian hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock characterized by its reduced foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more open, shrub-like growth habit compared to the typical dense canopy of the species. Its leaves are smaller and more sparsely distributed, giving the plant a distinctive, less dense appearance. The botanical features include dimorphic leaves, with juvenile leaves being scale-like and adult leaves being needle-like.</p>
<p>It is typically found in cooler, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories.</p>
