                    <h1>Torreya grandis f. non-apiculata</h1>
<p>Torreya grandis f. non-apiculata, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its coniferous appearance, with elongated, needle-like leaves. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including the absence of apiculate tips on its leaves, which distinguishes it from other forms of Torreya. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now heavily protected and considered a conservation priority.</p>
