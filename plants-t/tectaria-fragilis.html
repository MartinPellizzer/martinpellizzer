                    <h1>Tectaria fragilis</h1>
<p>Tectaria fragilis, commonly known as the brittle tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into lobes, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are often short and creeping, allowing it to spread across tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Tectaria fragilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in Southeast Asia and other tropical regions.</p>
