<p>Trymalium ledifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed trymalium, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Trymalium ledifolium is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
