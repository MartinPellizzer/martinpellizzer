                    <h1>Tapinanthus ghikae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus ghikae, commonly known as the Kikuyu dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
