<p>Tephrosia remotiflora, commonly known as the slender tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemose inflorescences, and it produces legume-like pods containing small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Tephrosia remotiflora is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
