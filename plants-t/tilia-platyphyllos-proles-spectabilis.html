                    <h1>Tilia platyphyllos proles spectabilis</h1>
<p>Tilia platyphyllos proles spectabilis, commonly known as the showy large-leaved lime, is a variant of the large-leaved lime tree native to southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
