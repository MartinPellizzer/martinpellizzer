                    <h1>Taraxacum franconicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum franconicum, commonly known as the Franconian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
