<p>Tirucalia rudolfii is a lesser-known yet fascinating plant species native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, commonly known as the legume or pea family. This plant is characterized by its delicate foliage and unique floral structure, which sets it apart from many other members of its family. Despite its beauty, Tirucalia rudolfii remains relatively understudied in scientific literature.
