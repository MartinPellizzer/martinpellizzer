<p>Tillandsia paniculata var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican pineapple bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central America and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments.</p>
