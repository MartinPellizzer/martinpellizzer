                <h1>Trichomanes franceae</h1>
<p>Trichomanes franceae, commonly known as the French maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
