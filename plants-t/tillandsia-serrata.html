                    <h1>Tillandsia serrata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia serrata, commonly known as the serrated air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
