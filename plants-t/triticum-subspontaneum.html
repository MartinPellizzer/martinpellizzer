<p>Triticum subspontaneum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and evolutionary studies.</p>
