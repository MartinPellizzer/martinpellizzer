                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. rubrispicatum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. rubrispicatum, commonly known as red spiculated emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stature and distinctive red, spiky awns that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typical of the wheat tribe. Its grains are relatively large and have a tough, inedible hull that must be removed before consumption.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in early agricultural practices.</p>
