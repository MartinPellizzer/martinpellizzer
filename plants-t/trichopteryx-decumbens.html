                    <h1>Trichopteryx decumbens</h1>
<p>Trichopteryx decumbens, commonly known as the creeping lily or golden crown, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Trichopteryx decumbens is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
