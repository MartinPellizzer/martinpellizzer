                    <h1>Trisetopsis imberbis</h1>
<p>Trisetopsis imberbis, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Trisetopsis imberbis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
