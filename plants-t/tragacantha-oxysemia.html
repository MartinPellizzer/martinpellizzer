<p>Tragacantha oxysemia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, is highly valued for its thickening properties and has been used historically in medicine and industry.</p>
