<p>Tribulus terrestris var. rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Indian goji or puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, ovate leaflets, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
