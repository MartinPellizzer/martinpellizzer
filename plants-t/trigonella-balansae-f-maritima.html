                    <h1>Trigonella balansae f. maritima</h1>
<p>Trigonella balansae f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal fenugreek, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds. Its small yellow flowers bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
