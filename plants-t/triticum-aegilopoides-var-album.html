                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides var. album</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides var. album, commonly known as white goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, white or pale florets that distinguish it from other wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces a large number of seeds, which contribute to its potential as a forage crop.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
