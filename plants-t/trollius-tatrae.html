<p>Trollius tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. It is considered an indicator species for calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trollius tatrae is classified as a vulnerable species.</p>
