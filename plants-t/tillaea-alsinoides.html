                    <h1>Tillaea alsinoides</h1>
<p>Tillaea alsinoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. Tillaea alsinoides thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water and nutrients.</p>
