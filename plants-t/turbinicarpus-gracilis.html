<p>Turbinicarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by pale green fruits. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
