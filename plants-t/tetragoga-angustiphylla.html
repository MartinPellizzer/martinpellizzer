                    <h1>Tetragoga angustiphylla</h1>
<p>Tetragoga angustiphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetragoga, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetragoga angustiphylla is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
