                    <h1>Tulexis</h1>
<p>Tulexis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tulexis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, highlights its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
