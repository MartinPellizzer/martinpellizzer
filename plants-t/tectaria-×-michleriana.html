                    <h1>Tectaria × michleriana</h1>
<p>Tectaria × michleriana, commonly known as the Michler's shield fern, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
