<p>Tephrocactus subsphaericus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical or nearly globular shape, with dense, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus subsphaericus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually striking plant.</p>
