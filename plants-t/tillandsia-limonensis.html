<p>Tillandsia limonensis, commonly known as the lemon-scented air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Tillandsia limonensis is well adapted to its environment, relying on air and rain for nourishment rather than soil.</p>
