                    <h1>Taraxacum pruinatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pruinatum, commonly known as the silvery dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
<p>Taraxacum pruinatum is adapted to harsh, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes.</p>
