                    <h1>Triticum syriacum</h1>
<p>Triticum syriacum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is one of the earliest domesticated wheat varieties, characterized by its small, tough grains and high protein content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear the grains. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients efficiently from the soil.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is notable for its genetic simplicity and resilience to various environmental conditions.</p>
