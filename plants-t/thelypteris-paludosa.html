                    <h1>Thelypteris paludosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris paludosa, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a species of fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris paludosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
