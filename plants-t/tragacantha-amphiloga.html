                    <h1>Tragacantha amphiloga</h1>
<p>Tragacantha amphiloga, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Tragacantha amphiloga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
