<p>Triticum pycnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing heads that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
