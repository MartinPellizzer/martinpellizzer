<p>Triticum aestivum subsp.</p>
<p>hadropyrum, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is adapted to drier climates, making it a valuable crop in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its grains are typically smaller than those of standard wheat varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and is used in the production of various flour types.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is also studied for potential use in climate-resilient agriculture.</p>
