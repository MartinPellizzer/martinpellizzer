                    <h1>Trifolium xatardii</h1>
<p>Trifolium xatardii, commonly known as the Xatard clover, is a rare and distinctive species of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Trifolium xatardii is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
