<p>Tofieldia cernua, commonly known as the nodding grass-of-parnassus, is a herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that droop downward. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Tofieldia cernua is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
