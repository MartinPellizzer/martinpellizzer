                    <h1>Telminostelma carautanum</h1>
<p>Telminostelma carautanum, commonly known as the Carautan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that aid in seed dispersal by birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
