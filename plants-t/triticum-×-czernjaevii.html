                    <h1>Triticum × czernjaevii</h1>
<p>Triticum × czernjaevii, commonly known as the Czernjaevii wheat, is a synthetic hexaploid wheat species resulting from the cross between Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum.</p>
<p>It possesses a complex genome structure with contributions from multiple wild wheat relatives. The plant typically exhibits robust growth and is characterized by its semi-dwarf stature and high grain yield potential. It is primarily used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits such as disease resistance and improved adaptability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable resource for wheat improvement in agricultural research.</p>
