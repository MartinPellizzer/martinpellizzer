<p>Tetrapilus yuennanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tetrapilus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetrapilus yuennanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
