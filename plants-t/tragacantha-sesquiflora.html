                    <h1>Tragacantha sesquiflora</h1>
<p>Tragacantha sesquiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a latex sap that is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha sesquiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
