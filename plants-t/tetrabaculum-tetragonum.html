<p>Tetrabaculum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, rigid stems and small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
