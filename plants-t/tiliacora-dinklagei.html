                    <h1>Tiliacora dinklagei</h1>
<p>Tiliacora dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's tiliacora, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, three-lobed berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
