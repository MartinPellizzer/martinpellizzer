                    <h1>Tapinanthus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus senegalensis, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant or the "ghost flower," is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to Africa and thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
