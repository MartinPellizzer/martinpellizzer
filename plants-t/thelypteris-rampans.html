<p>Thelypteris rampans, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Thelypteris rampans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
