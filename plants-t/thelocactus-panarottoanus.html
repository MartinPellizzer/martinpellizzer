                    <h1>Thelocactus panarottoanus</h1>
<p>Thelocactus panarottoanus, commonly known as the Panarotto's locactus, is a rare cactus species native to a restricted area in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, ribbed stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
