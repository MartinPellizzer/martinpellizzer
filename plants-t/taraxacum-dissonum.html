                    <h1>Taraxacum dissonum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum dissonum, commonly known as the dissonous dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to central and eastern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical seed sphere with white pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
