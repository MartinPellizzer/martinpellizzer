                    <h1>Thymus paronychioides</h1>
<p>Thymus paronychioides, commonly known as the rock thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>
