<p>Triticum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a small, annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it easily distinguishable from other wheat species. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with narrow, linear leaves. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its size and growth habit, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
