                    <h1>Tillandsia confinis var. caudata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia confinis var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it an ideal candidate for terrariums or hanging plant displays.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent and airplant enthusiasts.</p>
