                    <h1>Triticum longissimum</h1>
<p>Triticum longissimum, commonly known as the longest wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat characterized by its exceptionally long awns.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is considered a wild relative of modern wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and crop improvement.</p>
