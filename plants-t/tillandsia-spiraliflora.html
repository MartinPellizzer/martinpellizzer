                    <h1>Tillandsia spiraliflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spiraliflora, commonly known as the spiral-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale purple, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia spiraliflora is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
