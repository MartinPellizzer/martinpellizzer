<p>Tillandsia teloloapanensis, commonly known as the Teloloapan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
