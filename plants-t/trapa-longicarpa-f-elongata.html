                    <h1>Trapa longicarpa f. elongata</h1>
<p>Trapa longicarpa f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, inflated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit, which resembles a small, spiky bladder, contains the seeds and is adapted for buoyancy.</p>
