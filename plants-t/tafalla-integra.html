<p>Tafalla integra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Tafalla integra is often found in wetland or marshy environments due to its preference for moist soil.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
