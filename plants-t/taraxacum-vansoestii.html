                    <h1>Taraxacum vansoestii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum vansoestii, commonly known as the Van Soest's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a distinctive white pappus. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and taxonomy.</p>
