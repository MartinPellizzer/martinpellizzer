<p>Telmatophace arrhiza, commonly known as the marsh stiltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Telmatophace arrhiza plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
