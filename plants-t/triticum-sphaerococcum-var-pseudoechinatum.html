                    <h1>Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoechinatum</h1>
<p>Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoechinatum, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a rare and specialized grass species characterized by its unique inflorescence structure.</p>
<p>It features compact, spherical spikelets that are often covered in dense, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its limited distribution and ecological niche.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is noted for its morphological variations and is of interest in studies of grassland flora and plant adaptation.</p>
