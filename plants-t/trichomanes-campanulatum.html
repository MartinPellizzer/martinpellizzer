<p>Trichomanes campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, cup-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes campanulatum is known for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period.</p>
