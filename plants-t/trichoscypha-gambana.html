<p>Trichoscypha gambana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single, hard-shelled seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overexploitation, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
