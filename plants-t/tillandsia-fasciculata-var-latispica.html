                    <h1>Tillandsia fasciculata var. latispica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fasciculata var. latispica, commonly known as the broad-spined air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette structure, allowing it to efficiently collect and retain moisture from the air. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in a layer of trichomes, which aid in water absorption and reduce transpiration. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
