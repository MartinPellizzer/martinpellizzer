<p>Thelypteris pectiniformis, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often cinnamon-brown fiddleheads that unfurl into feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, and they are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
