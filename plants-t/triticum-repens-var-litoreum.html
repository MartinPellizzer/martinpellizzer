                    <h1>Triticum repens var. litoreum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. litoreum, commonly known as sea barley, is a variant of the annual grass species that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are often dispersed by wind. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread and colonize sandy or shingle beaches.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Triticum repens var. litoreum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
