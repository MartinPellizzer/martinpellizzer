                    <h1>Triticum ciliare</h1>
<p>Triticum ciliare, commonly known as slender wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves with ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Triticum ciliare is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a cover crop.</p>
