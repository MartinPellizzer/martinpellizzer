                    <h1>Trichosporum wallichii</h1>
<p>Trichosporum wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan mossy cup, is a species of cup fungi belonging to the family Trichosporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically covered in a dense layer of moss-like vegetative growth. The fungus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood in mountainous regions. Its spores are released in a sticky mass, which aids in their dispersal.</p>
<p>Trichosporum wallichii plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems by decomposing organic matter.</p>
