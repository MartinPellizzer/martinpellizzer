<p>Trichoscypha oddonii, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Trichoscypha oddonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
