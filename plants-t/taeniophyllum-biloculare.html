                    <h1>Taeniophyllum biloculare</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum biloculare, commonly known as the two-celled liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure with a distinct, segmented thallus that often forms dense mats on moist soil or rocks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its flattened, lobed structure for nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemmiferous pores, which aid in vegetative propagation.</p>
