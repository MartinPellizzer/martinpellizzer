                    <h1>Toxicodendron desertorum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron desertorum, commonly known as the desert poison ivy, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces clusters of red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats.</p>
