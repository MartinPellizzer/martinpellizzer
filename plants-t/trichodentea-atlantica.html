                <h1>Trichodentea atlantica</h1>
<p>Trichodentea atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic trichodentea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that give it its genus name, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
