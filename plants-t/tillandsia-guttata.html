                    <h1>Tillandsia guttata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia guttata, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia guttata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
