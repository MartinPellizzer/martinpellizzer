                    <h1>Trianthella racemosa</h1>
<p>Trianthella racemosa, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in racemes during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Trianthella racemosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
