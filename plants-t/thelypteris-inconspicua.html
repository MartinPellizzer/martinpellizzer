<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
