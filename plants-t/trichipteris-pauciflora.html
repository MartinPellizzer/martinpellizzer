<p>Trichipteris pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically released during the wet season. Trichipteris pauciflora is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and unique morphology make it a distinctive addition to its native habitats.</p>
