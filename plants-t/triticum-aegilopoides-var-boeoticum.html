                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides var. boeoticum</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides var. boeoticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its resilience in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in plant breeding for its potential to improve wheat varieties through genetic diversity.</p>
