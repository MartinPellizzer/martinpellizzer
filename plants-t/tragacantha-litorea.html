                    <h1>Tragacantha litorea</h1>
<p>Tragacantha litorea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binder in paints.</p>
<p>Tragacantha litorea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and dunes.</p>
