                    <h1>Thelocephala riparia</h1>
<p>Thelocephala riparia, commonly known as the river tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in whorls around the stem, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Thelocephala riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various insect and bird species.</p>
