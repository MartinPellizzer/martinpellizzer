                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. carabahicum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. carabahicum, commonly known as Carabahic emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that are often shorter than those of other wheat species. The grains are typically hulled, meaning they retain their outer bran layer, which contributes to its nutty flavor and higher nutritional content. This variety is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in ancient grain-based foods.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in agricultural biodiversity and is of interest for modern breeding programs.</p>
