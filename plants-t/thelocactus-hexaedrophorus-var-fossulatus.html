                    <h1>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. fossulatus</h1>
<p>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. fossulatus, commonly known as the fissured thorn cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
