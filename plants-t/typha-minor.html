                <h1>Typha minor</h1>
<p>Typha minor, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that matures into a brown, cotton-like structure. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Typha minor plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
