                    <h1>Thesium ebracteatum</h1>
<p>Thesium ebracteatum, commonly known as the naked thesium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its flowers are often subtended by bracts, though the species name "ebracteatum" suggests a reduction or absence of these structures.</p>
<p>Thesium ebracteatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or inland regions with low rainfall.</p>
