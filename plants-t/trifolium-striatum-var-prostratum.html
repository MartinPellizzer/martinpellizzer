                    <h1>Trifolium striatum var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Trifolium striatum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
