                    <h1>Trichomanes suffrutex</h1>
<p>Trichomanes suffrutex, commonly known as the creeping tamarisk fern, is a small, low-growing fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are characteristic of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of its ecological niche.</p>
