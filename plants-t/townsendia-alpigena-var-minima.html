                    <h1>Townsendia alpigena var. minima</h1>
<p>Townsendia alpigena var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf alpine fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 7,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its range.</p>
