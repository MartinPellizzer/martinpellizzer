                    <h1>Trapa caucasica</h1>
<p>Trapa caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Caspian and Black Sea regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its leaves remain above the water surface.</p>
<p>Trapa caucasica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
