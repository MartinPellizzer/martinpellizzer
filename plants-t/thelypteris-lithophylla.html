<p>Thelypteris lithophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its habitat, while its spores are dispersed through the wind.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lithophylla is an important component of the ecological diversity in its native range.</p>
