                    <h1>Taraxacum hollandicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hollandicum, commonly known as the Dutch dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its pappus, which allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hollandicum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
