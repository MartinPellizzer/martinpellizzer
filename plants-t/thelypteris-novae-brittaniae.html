<p>Thelypteris novae-brittaniae, commonly known as the New Britain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific islands, particularly New Britain in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in moist, forested areas.</p>
<p>Thelypteris novae-brittaniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
