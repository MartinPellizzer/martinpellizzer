                    <h1>Thelypteris palustris f. suaveolens</h1>
<p>Thelypteris palustris f. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented field fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with a pale green or reddish hue. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fragrant, citrus-like scent is released when the fronds are disturbed, making it distinctive in its environment.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
