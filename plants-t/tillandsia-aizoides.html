<p>Tillandsia aizoides, commonly known as the silver leaf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it is an epiphyte that thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique structure and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
