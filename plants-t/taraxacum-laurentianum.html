<p>Taraxacum laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to North America, particularly found in the Laurentian region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a hairy surface, while its flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
