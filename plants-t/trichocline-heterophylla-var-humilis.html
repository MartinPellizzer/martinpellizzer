                    <h1>Trichocline heterophylla var. humilis</h1>
<p>Trichocline heterophylla var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf trichocline, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
