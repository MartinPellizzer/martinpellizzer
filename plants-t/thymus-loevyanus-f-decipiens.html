                    <h1>Thymus loevyanus f. decipiens</h1>
<p>Thymus loevyanus f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive thyme, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of thyme native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of common thyme, though it is less commonly used in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
