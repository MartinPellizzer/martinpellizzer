                    <h1>Tectaria hookeri</h1>
<p>Tectaria hookeri, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Tectaria hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
