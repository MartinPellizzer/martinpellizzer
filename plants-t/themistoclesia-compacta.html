<p>Themistoclesia compacta, commonly known as the compact thimble cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny exterior that protects it from herbivores and excessive water loss. The plant has a short, branched stem with small, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
