                    <h1>Tilia × pseudostellata</h1>
<p>Tilia × pseudostellata, commonly known as the hybrid linden tree, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of Tilia cordata but smaller than Tilia platyphyllos. Its flowers are fragrant and clustered, producing nectar that attracts bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic appeal.</p>
