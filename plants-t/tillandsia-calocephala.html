                    <h1>Tillandsia calocephala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia calocephala, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
