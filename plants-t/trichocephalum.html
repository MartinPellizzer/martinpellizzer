<p>Trichocephalum, commonly known as the haircap moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, slender, and often hairy stems that give them their common name. Trichocephalum species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. They have a complex structure with leaf-like structures called phyllodes and a central stalk.</p>
<p>These mosses play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems.</p>
