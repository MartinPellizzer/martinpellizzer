                    <h1>Tetrorchidium boyacanum</h1>
<p>Tetrorchidium boyacanum, commonly known as the Boyac√° orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to anchor itself to rocky substrates, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
