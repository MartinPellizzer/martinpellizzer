                    <h1>Trophaeum moritzianum</h1>
<p>Trophaeum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which contribute to its common name. Its botanical features include long, slender roots and a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that helps store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specialized requirements, Trophaeum moritzianum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
