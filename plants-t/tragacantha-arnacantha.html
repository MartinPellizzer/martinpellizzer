<p>Tragacantha arnacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, globular seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
