<p>Thelypteris dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang water fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
