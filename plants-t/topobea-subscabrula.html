                    <h1>Topobea subscabrula</h1>
<p>Topobea subscabrula, commonly known as the roughleaf topobea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Topobea subscabrula plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides forage for certain wildlife species.</p>
