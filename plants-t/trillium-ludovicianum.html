                    <h1>Trillium ludovicianum</h1>
<p>Trillium ludovicianum, commonly known as the Florida trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features three broadly elliptic leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint, and it produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant blooms in early spring and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its growth. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
