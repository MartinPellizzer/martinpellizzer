                    <h1>Tillandsia religiosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia religiosa, commonly known as the sacred air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant's rosette-shaped structure is covered in dense, fibrous leaves that trap moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and association with sacred sites, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
