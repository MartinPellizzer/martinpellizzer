<p>Thelypteris micans, commonly known as the shining shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a shimmering appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, forested habitats.</p>
