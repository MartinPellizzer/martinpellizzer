                    <h1>Taraxacum cenabense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum cenabense, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other dandelion species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
