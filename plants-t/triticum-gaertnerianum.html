<p>Triticum gaertnerianum, commonly known as the gaertnerian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed glumes. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in hard, indehiscent grains.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties.</p>
