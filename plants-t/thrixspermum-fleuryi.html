The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Thrixspermum fleuryi is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems due to its limited distribution.</p>
