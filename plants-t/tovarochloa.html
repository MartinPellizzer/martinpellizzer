                    <h1>Tovarochloa</h1>
<p>Tovarochloa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Tovarochloa is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
