<p>Thelypteris lamii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lamii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
