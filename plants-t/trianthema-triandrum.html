                    <h1>Trianthema triandrum</h1>
<p>Trianthema triandrum, commonly known as the desert star or yellow star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Trianthema triandrum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
