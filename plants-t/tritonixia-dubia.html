                    <h1>Tritonixia dubia</h1>
<p>Tritonixia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Tritonixia dubia is classified as a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its rare and ephemeral blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
