<p>Thalia trichocalyx, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and specialized root systems that help it thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Thalia trichocalyx plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to saline conditions makes it a key component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
