<p>Trichophyllum palustre var. calvum, commonly known as the hairless swamp trichophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and reduced floral structures, adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. It typically grows in boggy or marshy environments where water saturation is high.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
