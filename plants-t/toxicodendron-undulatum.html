                    <h1>Toxicodendron undulatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron undulatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a compound found in many members of the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
