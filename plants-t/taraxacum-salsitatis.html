                    <h1>Taraxacum salsitatis</h1>
<p>Taraxacum salsitatis, commonly known as the salt marsh dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in wetlands and salt marshes. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Taraxacum salsitatis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
