<p>Common dandelion, scientifically known as Taraxacum opacum, is a ubiquitous weed found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. Its distinctive features include a rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a bright yellow flower that matures into a fuzzy white sphere of seeds. Despite its reputation as a nuisance, the dandelion has been valued for its medicinal properties and nutritional benefits. The plant's ability to thrive in various conditions makes it a resilient and widespread species. Its cultural significance spans from folklore to culinary uses, highlighting its role in both nature and human history.</p>
