                    <h1>Tapinanthus toroensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus toroensis, commonly known as the Torosense dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host.</p>
