<p>Thelypteris uliginosa var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats.</p>
