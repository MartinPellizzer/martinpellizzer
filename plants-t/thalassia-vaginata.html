<p>Thalassia vaginata, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species that thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for marine life. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with rhizomes spreading to form extensive underwater carpets.</p>
<p>Thalassia vaginata plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water quality in marine ecosystems.</p>
