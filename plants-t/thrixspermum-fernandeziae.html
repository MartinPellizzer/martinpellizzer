<p>Thrixspermum fernandeziae, commonly known as the Fernandezia fern, is a rare fern species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a soft texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in moist crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
