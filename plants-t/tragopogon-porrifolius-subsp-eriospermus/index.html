                            <h1>Tragopogon Porrifolius Subsp. Eriospermus</h1>
<p>Tragopogon porrifolius subsp. eriospermus is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy leaves and distinctive flower heads that bloom in late spring and early summer. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it has adapted to a variety of habitats including meadows and rocky soils. Its fibrous roots and hardy nature make it resilient to environmental stressors. Despite its modest stature, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native regions.</p>
