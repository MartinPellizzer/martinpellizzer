<p>Trichocentrum nudum, commonly known as the naked orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum nudum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
