                    <h1>Triodia irritans var. laxispicata</h1>
<p>Triodia irritans var. laxispicata, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and produces slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant's inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its name reflects its irritant properties, as the leaves can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
