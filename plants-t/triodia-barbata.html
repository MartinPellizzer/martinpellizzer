<p>Triodia barbata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Triodia barbata is well adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
