                    <h1>Taraxacum subpraticola</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subpraticola, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head known as a "puffball," which releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
