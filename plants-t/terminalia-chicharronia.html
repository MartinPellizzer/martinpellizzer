                    <h1>Terminalia chicharronia</h1>
<p>Terminalia chicharronia, commonly known as the red mangrove or *mangrove de la cienaga*, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it withstand saltwater and tidal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy red berries. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Terminalia chicharronia plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection.</p>
