<p>Thelypteris rotumaensis, commonly known as the Rotuma shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific island of Rotuma.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rotumaensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
