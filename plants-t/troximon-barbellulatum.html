                    <h1>Troximon barbellulatum</h1>
<p>Troximon barbellulatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds. It is native to regions in Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
