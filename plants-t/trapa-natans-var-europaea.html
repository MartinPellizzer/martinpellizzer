                    <h1>Trapa natans var. europaea</h1>
<p>Trapa natans var. europaea, commonly known as the European water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broadly ovate and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically submerged, with the stamens and pistil emerging above the water surface. Its fruit is a distinctive, spiny, spherical structure that contains one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
