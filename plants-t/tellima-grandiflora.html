                    <h1>Tellima grandiflora</h1>
<p>Tellima grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tellima, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, two-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
