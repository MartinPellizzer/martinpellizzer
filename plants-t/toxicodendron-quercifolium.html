                    <h1>Toxicodendron quercifolium</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaf poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation in many people.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in forested areas.</p>
