<p>Thenardia floribunda, commonly known as the red-flowered sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright red flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize loose soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment.</p>
