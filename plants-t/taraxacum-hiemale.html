                    <h1>Taraxacum hiemale</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hiemale, commonly known as the winter dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and gradually become more lanceolate towards the upper stems. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head in the early spring, before the leaves fully emerge. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hiemale is adapted to cold climates and can often be found growing in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils during the winter months.</p>
