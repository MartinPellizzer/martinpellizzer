                    <h1>Tillandsia stenoura var. tripinnata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stenoura var. tripinnata, commonly known as the Three-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
