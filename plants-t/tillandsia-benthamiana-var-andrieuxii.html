                    <h1>Tillandsia benthamiana var. andrieuxii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia benthamiana var. andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, showy inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
