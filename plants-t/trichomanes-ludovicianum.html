                    <h1>Trichomanes ludovicianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes ludovicianum, commonly known as the Appalachian maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
