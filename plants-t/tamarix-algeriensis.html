<p>Tamarix algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often multi-branched structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators. Its leaves are scale-like and reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Tamarix algeriensis is also known for its fast growth rate and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
