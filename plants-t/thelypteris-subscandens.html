<p>Thelypteris subscandens, commonly known as the scandent water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris subscandens plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
