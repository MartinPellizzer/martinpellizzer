<p>Tuberaria commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tuberous speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters. The plant has tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tuberaria commutata is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
