                    <h1>Telipogon amicorum</h1>
<p>Telipogon amicorum, commonly known as the friendship grass, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale blue in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the ecology of alpine flora and conservation efforts in mountainous regions.</p>
