<p>Thalictrum sylvaticum subsp.</p>
<p>pratense, commonly known as meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
