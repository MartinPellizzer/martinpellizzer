                    <h1>Tapinanthus kisaguka</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus kisaguka, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant, is a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to eastern Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host, enabling it to draw water and minerals.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics include a slender stem, lance-shaped leaves, and a short life cycle that often coincides with the rainy season.</p>
