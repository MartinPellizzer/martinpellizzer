                    <h1>Taraxacum edytomum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum edytomum, commonly known as the Eddy's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-less florets arranged in a composite structure typical of the dandelion genus. This species is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
