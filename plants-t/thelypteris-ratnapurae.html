                    <h1>Thelypteris ratnapurae</h1>
<p>Thelypteris ratnapurae, commonly known as the Ratnapura holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common reproductive feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
