                    <h1>Tillandsia espinosae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
