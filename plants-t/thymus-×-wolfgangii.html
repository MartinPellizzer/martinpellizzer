<p>Thymus × wolfgangii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Thymus × wolfgangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is often grown for its fragrant foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
