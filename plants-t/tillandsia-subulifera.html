                    <h1>Tillandsia subulifera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subulifera, commonly known as the needle-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>This species is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
