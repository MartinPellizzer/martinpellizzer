<p>Thelypteris connexa, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris connexa plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
