                    <h1>Taraxacum praestabile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum praestabile, commonly known as the noble dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum praestabile is valued for its medicinal properties and is also a common weed in many parts of Europe and North America.</p>
