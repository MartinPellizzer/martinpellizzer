                    <h1>Thelypteris amphioxypteris</h1>
<p>Thelypteris amphioxypteris, commonly known as the broad-veined shield fern, is a fossil plant species belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with broad, parallel veins and a shield-shaped base, which are preserved in sedimentary rock layers. This plant thrived during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian periods, indicating its presence in ancient, swampy environments. Its morphology suggests it was a medium-sized herbaceous plant, likely growing in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>The study of Thelypteris amphioxypteris provides valuable insights into the paleobotany and ecological conditions of early terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
