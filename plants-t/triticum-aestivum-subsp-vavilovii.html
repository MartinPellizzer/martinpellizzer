<p>Triticum aestivum subsp.</p>
<p>vavilovii, commonly known as Vavilov's wheat, is a wild relative of bread wheat that is native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and its panicle-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to plant breeders due to its potential for improving the genetic diversity and resilience of cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
