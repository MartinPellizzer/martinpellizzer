                    <h1>Topobea multiflora</h1>
<p>Topobea multiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Topobea multiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
