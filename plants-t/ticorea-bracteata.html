<p>Ticorea bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
