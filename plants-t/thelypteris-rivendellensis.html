<p>Thelypteris rivendellensis, commonly known as the Rivendell holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a graceful, arching form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rivendellensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
