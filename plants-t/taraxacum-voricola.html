                    <h1>Taraxacum voricola</h1>
<p>Taraxacum voricola, commonly known as the voracious dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, bright yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, spiky stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Its leaves are broadly lanceolate and have a serrated margin, often with a hairy underside.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like pappus, allowing the plant to spread efficiently in new areas.</p>
