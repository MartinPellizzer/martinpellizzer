                    <h1>Thalictrum scabrifolium var. leve</h1>
<p>Thalictrum scabrifolium var. leve, commonly known as the rough-leaved meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in loose panicles. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to thrive in moist, woodland environments with partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
