                    <h1>Trichodium filiforme</h1>
<p>Trichodium filiforme, commonly known as the threadleaf spurge, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are typically followed by orange or red berries. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
