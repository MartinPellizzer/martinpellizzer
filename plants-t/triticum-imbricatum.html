                    <h1>Triticum imbricatum</h1>
<p>Triticum imbricatum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, protective husk, which helps in seed dispersal and survival in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Triticum imbricatum is considered an important wild relative of cultivated wheat species due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation.</p>
