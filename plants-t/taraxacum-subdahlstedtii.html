                    <h1>Taraxacum subdahlstedtii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subdahlstedtii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a bright yellow composite flower head. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and later the seed-filled sphere known as a "puffball.".</p>
<p>It is adapted to thrive in temperate climates and is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
