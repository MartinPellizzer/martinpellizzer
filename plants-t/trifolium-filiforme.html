<p>Trifolium filiforme, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three narrow, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Trifolium filiforme is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
