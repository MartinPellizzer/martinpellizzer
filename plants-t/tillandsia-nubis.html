                    <h1>Tillandsia nubis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nubis, commonly known as the cloud tillandsia, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air through its specialized leaves. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead uses its leaf surfaces to capture water and minerals. Its foliage is typically dense and covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nubis is prized for its ability to grow in low-light conditions and its striking, often variegated appearance.</p>
