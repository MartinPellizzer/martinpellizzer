                    <h1>Telmatophace</h1>
<p>Telmatophace, commonly known as the "marsh face" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland and marsh environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Telmatophace species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a yellow or white coloration. They play an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to their habitat preferences, they are often indicators of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments.</p>
