                    <h1>Trichomanes rigidum var. laxum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes rigidum var. laxum, commonly known as the loose fern, is a variant of the rigid holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern with slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving the plant a finely divided appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its more open and loosely arranged fronds compared to the typical form of Trichomanes rigidum.</p>
