<p>Taeniophyllum brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, wiry stem and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
