<p>Tithymalus telephioides, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Tithymalus telephioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
