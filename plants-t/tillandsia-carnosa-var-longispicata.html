                    <h1>Tillandsia carnosa var. longispicata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carnosa var. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, white, spore-bearing structures called spathes.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
