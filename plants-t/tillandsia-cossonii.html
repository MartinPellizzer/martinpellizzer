                    <h1>Tillandsia cossonii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cossonii, commonly known as the Cosson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia cossonii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
