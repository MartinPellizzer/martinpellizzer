                    <h1>Triticum goiranianum</h1>
<p>Triticum goiranianum, commonly known as the Goiran wheat, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a grass-like plant with slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks, which help them survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
