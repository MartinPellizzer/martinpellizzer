                    <h1>Taraxacum divarium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum divarium, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
