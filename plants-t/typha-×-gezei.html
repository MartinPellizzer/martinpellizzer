<p>Typha × gezei, commonly known as the giant cattail, is a hybrid wetland plant that combines traits from Typha latifolia and Typha angustifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and its distinctive, sausage-shaped brown flower heads that contain numerous tiny seeds. This plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Typha × gezei plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
