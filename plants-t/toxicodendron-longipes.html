                    <h1>Toxicodendron longipes</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, often using its aerial roots to ascend trees. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and animals, though some insects and birds may feed on its foliage.</p>
