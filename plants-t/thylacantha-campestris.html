                    <h1>Thylacantha campestris</h1>
<p>Thylacantha campestris, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Thylacantha campestris is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
