<p>Trixis amphimalaca, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Trixis amphimalaca is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
