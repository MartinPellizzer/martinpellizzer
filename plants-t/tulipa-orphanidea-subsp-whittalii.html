<p>Tulipa orphanidea subsp.</p>
<p>whittalii, commonly known as the Whittall's tulip, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Tian Shan mountains in Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brown eye. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
