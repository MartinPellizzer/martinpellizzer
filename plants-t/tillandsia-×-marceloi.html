                    <h1>Tillandsia × marceloi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × marceloi, commonly known as the hybrid air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which is covered in trichomes that help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
