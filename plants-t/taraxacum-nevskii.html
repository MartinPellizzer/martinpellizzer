<p>Taraxacum nevskii, commonly known as the Siberian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow composite flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Taraxacum nevskii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
