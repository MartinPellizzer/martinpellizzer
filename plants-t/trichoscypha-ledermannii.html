<p>Trichoscypha ledermannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
