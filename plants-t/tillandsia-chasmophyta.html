                    <h1>Tillandsia chasmophyta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chasmophyta, commonly known as the cliff tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
