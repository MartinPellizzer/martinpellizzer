                    <h1>Tillandsia alvareziae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia alvareziae, commonly known as the Alvarez's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
