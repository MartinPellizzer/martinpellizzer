                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. tomentosum, commonly known as black rye, is a wild relative of wheat characterized by its dark, husk-covered grains.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tightly packed florets. Its seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional foods and remedies.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in agricultural research for improving wheat varieties.</p>
