<p>Tillandsia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rariflora is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
