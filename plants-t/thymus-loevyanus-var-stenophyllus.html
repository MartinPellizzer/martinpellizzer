<p>Thymus loevyanus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are used in culinary applications and traditional medicine, similar to other thyme varieties.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction lies in its narrower foliage compared to other Thymus species.</p>
