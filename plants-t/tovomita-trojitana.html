                    <h1>Tovomita trojitana</h1>
<p>Tovomita trojitana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Tovomita trojitana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
