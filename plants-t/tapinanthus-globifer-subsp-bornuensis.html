<p>Tapinanthus globifer subsp.</p>
<p>bornuensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It possesses specialized roots called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
