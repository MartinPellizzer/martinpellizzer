                    <h1>Tillandsia spiculosa var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spiculosa var. micrantha, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it capture water and sunlight. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among airplant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
