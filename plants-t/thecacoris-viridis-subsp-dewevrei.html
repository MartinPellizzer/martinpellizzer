<p>Thecacoris viridis subsp.</p>
<p>dewevrei, commonly known as the green velvet fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a lush, green appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or brown, blending with the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
