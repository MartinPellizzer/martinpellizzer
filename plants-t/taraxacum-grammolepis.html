                    <h1>Taraxacum grammolepis</h1>
<p>Taraxacum grammolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, tall, hairy stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-covered seeds that are easily dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed areas and a subject of study in plant ecology and taxonomy.</p>
