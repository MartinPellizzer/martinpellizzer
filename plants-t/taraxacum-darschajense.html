                    <h1>Taraxacum darschajense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum darschajense, commonly known as the Darschajean dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, elongated stem that supports the flower and later develops into a pilose pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Taraxacum genus.</p>
