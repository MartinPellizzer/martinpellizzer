                    <h1>Triticum batalinii</h1>
<p>Triticum batalinii, commonly known as the Batalin's wheat, is a rare and little-studied species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow florets, typical of many wheat species. Its genetic makeup offers potential insights into the evolution and domestication of wheat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and genetic research.</p>
