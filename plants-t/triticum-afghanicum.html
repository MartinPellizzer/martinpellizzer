<p>Triticum afghanicum, commonly known as Afghan wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and oval, with a hard outer coat that aids in seed dormancy.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve drought resistance in wheat varieties.</p>
