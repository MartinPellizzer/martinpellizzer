                    <h1>Tillandsia gracillima</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gracillima, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant is notable for its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
