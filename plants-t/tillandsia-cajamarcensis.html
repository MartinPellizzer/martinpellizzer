                    <h1>Tillandsia cajamarcensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cajamarcensis, commonly known as the Cajamarca air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of northern Peru.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
