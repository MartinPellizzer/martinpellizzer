                    <h1>Tillandsia fendleri var. nervisepala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fendleri var. nervisepala, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
