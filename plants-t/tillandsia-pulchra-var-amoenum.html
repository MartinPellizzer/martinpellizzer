                    <h1>Tillandsia pulchra var. amoenum</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pulchra var. amoenum, commonly known as the Purple-veined Air Plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and good air circulation.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
