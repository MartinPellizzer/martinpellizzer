                    <h1>Tapinanthus copaiferae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus copaiferae, commonly known as the Copaiba dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host, making it a challenging weed in agricultural settings.</p>
