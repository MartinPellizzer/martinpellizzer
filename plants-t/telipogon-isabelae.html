<p>Telipogon isabelae, commonly known as Isabel's grass, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
