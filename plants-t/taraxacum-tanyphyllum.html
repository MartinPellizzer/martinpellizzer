                    <h1>Taraxacum tanyphyllum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum tanyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hairy stem that supports a flower head composed of small yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive spherical seed head, or pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Taraxacum tanyphyllum is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
