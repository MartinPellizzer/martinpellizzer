                    <h1>Tilia caroliniana var. lata</h1>
<p>Tilia caroliniana var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Tilia caroliniana, often reaching up to 10 inches in width. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
