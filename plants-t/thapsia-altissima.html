<p>Thapsia altissima, commonly known as the Spanish fennel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of fennel. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to fennel.</p>
<p>Thapsia altissima is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
