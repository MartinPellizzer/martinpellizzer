                    <h1>Trisetum wrangelense</h1>
<p>Trisetum wrangelense, commonly known as Wrangel's needlegrass, is a rare and endangered grass species native to the Arctic regions of Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, cold environments such as tundra and dry slopes. Its survival is closely tied to specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
