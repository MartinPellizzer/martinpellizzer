<p>Thelypteris humilis, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a reddish or brownish hue when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Thelypteris humilis has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
