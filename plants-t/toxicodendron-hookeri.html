<p>Toxicodendron hookeri, commonly known as the Southern poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, hairy fruits. It is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin rashes upon contact.</p>
