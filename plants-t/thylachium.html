                    <h1>Thylachium</h1>
<p>Thylachium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, delicate flower that often resembles a ghostly shape. Thylachium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
