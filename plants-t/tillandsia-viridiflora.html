                    <h1>Tillandsia viridiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is well adapted to humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
