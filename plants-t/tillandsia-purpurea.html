                    <h1>Tillandsia purpurea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia purpurea, commonly known as the purple air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia purpurea produces striking inflorescences with purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
