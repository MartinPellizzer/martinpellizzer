<p>Terebinthus jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull√©n terebinth, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
