<p>Taeniophyllum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, resembling the color of the surrounding foliage. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, narrow leaf. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
