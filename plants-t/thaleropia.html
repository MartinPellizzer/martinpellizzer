<p>Thaleropia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Thaleropia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
