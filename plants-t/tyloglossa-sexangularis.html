<p>Tyloglossa sexangularis, commonly known as the angular-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, angular-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, which is common in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>
