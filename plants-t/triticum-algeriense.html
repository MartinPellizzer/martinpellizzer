                    <h1>Triticum algeriense</h1>
<p>Triticum algeriense, commonly known as Algerian wheat, is a wild grass species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and produce a hard, durable grain that has been studied for its potential in breeding modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum algeriense is of interest in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience to climate stress.</p>
