                    <h1>Thismia kelantanensis</h1>
<p>Thismia kelantanensis, commonly known as the Kelantan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their myco-heterotrophic lifestyle, meaning they obtain nutrients through symbiotic relationships with fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its fungal partners for sustenance. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often resembling ghostly shapes, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Thismia kelantanensis is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
