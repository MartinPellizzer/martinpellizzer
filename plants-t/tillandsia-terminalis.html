                    <h1>Tillandsia terminalis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia terminalis, commonly known as the silver pine or air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant in indoor gardening.</p>
