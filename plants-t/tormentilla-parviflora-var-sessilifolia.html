                    <h1>Tormentilla parviflora var. sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Tormentilla parviflora var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are small, oval, and sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
