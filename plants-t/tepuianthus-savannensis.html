<p>Tepuianthus savannensis, commonly known as the Guyana Highlands trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of the Guiana Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the high-altitude savannas, where it adapts to nutrient-poor soils and high UV exposure. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tepuianthus savannensis plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for endemic species.</p>
