<p>Tillandsia plagiotropica, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia plagiotropica is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
