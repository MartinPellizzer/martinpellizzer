<p>Trifolium hybridum subsp.</p>
<p>hybridum, commonly known as white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. White clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in agriculture and ecological restoration due to its soil-enriching properties.</p>
