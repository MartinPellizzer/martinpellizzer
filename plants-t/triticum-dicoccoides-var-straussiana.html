                    <h1>Triticum dicoccoides var. straussiana</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccoides var. straussiana, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is an ancient wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.1 Gb, making it one of the largest among cereals. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters, with glumes that are usually shorter than the spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is of significant interest in genetic research due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through wild relative crosses.</p>
