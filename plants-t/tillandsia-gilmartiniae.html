<p>Tillandsia gilmartiniae, commonly known as the Gilmartin air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-white color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia gilmartiniae is valued for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions.</p>
