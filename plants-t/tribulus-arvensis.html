<p>Tribulus arvensis, commonly known as puncture vine, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits that contain hard, sharp seeds, which can cause irritation if they come into contact with skin. Tribulus arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
