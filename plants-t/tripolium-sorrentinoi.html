<p>Tripolium sorrentinoi, commonly known as the Sorrento thornweed, is a rare shrub native to the volcanic soils of the Sorrento Peninsula in Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
