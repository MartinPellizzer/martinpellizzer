                    <h1>Tillandsia graebeneri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia graebeneri, commonly known as the Graebner's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia graebeneri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
