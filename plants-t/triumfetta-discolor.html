                    <h1>Triumfetta discolor</h1>
<p>Triumfetta discolor, commonly known as the white bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a ball or a cluster of small bells. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
