                    <h1>Tylosepalum aurantiacum</h1>
<p>Tylosepalum aurantiacum, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense, feather-like crown of leaves. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Tylosepalum aurantiacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems, though it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
