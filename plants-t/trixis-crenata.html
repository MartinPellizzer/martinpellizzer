<p>Trixis crenata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Trixis crenata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
