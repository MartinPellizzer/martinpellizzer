<p>Thelypteris platypes, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it in muddy or aquatic soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
