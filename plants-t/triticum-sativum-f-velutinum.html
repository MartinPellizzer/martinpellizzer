                    <h1>Triticum sativum f. velutinum</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvety wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its soft, silky texture on the leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in cooler climates and is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic qualities rather than for grain production. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter, more densely packed leaves compared to the standard wheat variety. It is also noted for its increased resistance to certain fungal diseases, making it a valuable subject in agricultural research.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its use in specialty seed markets and botanical gardens.</p>
