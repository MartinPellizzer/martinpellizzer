                    <h1>Triticum subsecundum</h1>
<p>Triticum subsecundum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, parallel-veined leaves and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it plays a role in ecological restoration and as a genetic resource for wheat improvement.</p>
