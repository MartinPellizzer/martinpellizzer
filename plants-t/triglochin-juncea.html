                    <h1>Triglochin juncea</h1>
<p>Triglochin juncea, commonly known as slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Triglochin juncea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
