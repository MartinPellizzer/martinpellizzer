                    <h1>Trisetarium</h1>
<p>Trisetarium, commonly known as the three-branched spikelet, is a botanical structure found in certain grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>It consists of a central axis with three branches, each potentially bearing flowers or inflorescences. This unique arrangement is characteristic of the Poaceae (grass family) and Cyperaceae (sedge family). The trisetarium plays a role in the plant's reproductive strategy by increasing the chances of successful pollination.</p>
<p>Its structure is often used in taxonomic identification of grass species.</p>
