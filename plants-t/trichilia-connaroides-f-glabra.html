                    <h1>Trichilia connaroides f. glabra</h1>
<p>Trichilia connaroides f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth trichilia, is a variant of the African mahogany tree.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>The smooth glabrous leaves distinguish this form from other variants of the species.</p>
