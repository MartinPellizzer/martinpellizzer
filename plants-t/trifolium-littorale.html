                    <h1>Trifolium littorale</h1>
<p>Trifolium littorale, commonly known as sea clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Trifolium littorale plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
