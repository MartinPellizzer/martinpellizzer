<p>Tithymalus neilmulleri, commonly known as the Neill's tithymalus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its small, daisy-like flowers are often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
