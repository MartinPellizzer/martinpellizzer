<p>Tristicha trifaria subsp.</p>
<p>trifaria, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, triangular fronds with a serrated margin, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This species thrives in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments, making it a characteristic component of marsh and swamp ecosystems.</p>
