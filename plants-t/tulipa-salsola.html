                    <h1>Tulipa salsola</h1>
<p>Tulipa salsola, commonly known as desert tulip, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and produces basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Tulipa salsola is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in extreme environments.</p>
