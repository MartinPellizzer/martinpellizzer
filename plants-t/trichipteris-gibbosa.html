                    <h1>Trichipteris gibbosa</h1>
<p>Trichipteris gibbosa, commonly known as the curled liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Trichipteris gibbosa typically thrives in humid, temperate regions, often found in forest floors or on rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for moist, undisturbed habitats.</p>
