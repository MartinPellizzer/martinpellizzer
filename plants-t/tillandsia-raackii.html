<p>Tillandsia raackii, commonly known as the Raack's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water absorption.</p>
<p>Tillandsia raackii produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom after the plant has matured.</p>
