<p>Triticum monococcum subsp.</p>
<p>aegilopoides, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid grass with small, glabrous seeds that are typically brown to reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain several florets. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in plant breeding for its potential genetic contributions to cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
