<p>Thelypteris appendiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris appendiculata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
