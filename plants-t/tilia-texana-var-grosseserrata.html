                    <h1>Tilia texana var. grosseserrata</h1>
<p>Tilia texana var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the Texas large-leaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with coarsely serrated margins, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is light and soft, making it suitable for carving and small crafts.</p>
