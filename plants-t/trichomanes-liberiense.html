<p>Trichomanes liberiense, commonly known as the Liberian water fern, is a species of fern native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes liberiense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
