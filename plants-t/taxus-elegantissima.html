<p>Taxus elegantissima, commonly known as the noble yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. It has a distinctive, dense crown and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Taxus elegantissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
