                    <h1>Triticum unilaterale</h1>
<p>Triticum unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more prominently than the other. This asymmetrical growth is believed to be a result of genetic mutation or environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden florets.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual appearance, it is not widely cultivated and remains of interest primarily to botanists and geneticists.</p>
