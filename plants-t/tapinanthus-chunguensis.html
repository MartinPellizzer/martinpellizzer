                    <h1>Tapinanthus chunguensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus chunguensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to the stems of its host plants, drawing nutrients and water through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as savannas and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
