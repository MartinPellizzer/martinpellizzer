                    <h1>Tephrocactus bicolor</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its striking two-toned appearance, with green to blue-green stems and yellow to orange spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus bicolor is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
