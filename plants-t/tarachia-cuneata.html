                    <h1>Tarachia cuneata</h1>
<p>Tarachia cuneata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded form and gray-green foliage that is adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Tarachia cuneata is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
