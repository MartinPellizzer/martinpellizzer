                    <h1>Trichocarpus</h1>
<p>Trichocarpus, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant that belongs to the order Cycadales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Trichocarpus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
<p>They have a long evolutionary history and are considered living fossils due to their ancient lineage.</p>
