                    <h1>Typha pontica</h1>
<p>Typha pontica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its distinctive brown, cylindrical flower spike that contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly.</p>
<p>Typha pontica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
