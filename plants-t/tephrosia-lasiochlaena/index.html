<p>Tephrosia with hairy leaves, scientifically known as Tephrosia lasiochlaena, is a unique member of the Fabaceae family found in tropical regions. This plant is characterized by its distinctive foliage, where the leaves are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that give it a soft, textured appearance. Native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Tephrosia lasiochlaena thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its hairy leaves not only aid in moisture retention but also provide a natural defense against herbivores. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, this plant has gained attention among botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
