                    <h1>Tunica prolifera var. scabricaulis</h1>
<p>Tunica prolifera var. scabricaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed tunica, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it has adapted to extreme conditions through its thick, waxy leaves. The plant's stems are covered in a rough, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss and provides protection against harsh weather. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green or yellow, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
