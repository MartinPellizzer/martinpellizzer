                    <h1>Trisetum alpestre var. argentoideum</h1>
<p>Trisetum alpestre var. argentoideum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
