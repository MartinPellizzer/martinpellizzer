<p>Tanacetum humile, commonly known as the dwarf tansy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow to white flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Tanacetum humile is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties.</p>
