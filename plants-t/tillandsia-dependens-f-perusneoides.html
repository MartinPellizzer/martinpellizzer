                    <h1>Tillandsia dependens f. perusneoides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dependens f. perusneoides, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a unique bromeliad species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin leaves that form a rosette, creating a small, water-holding structure at the center. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>This plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
