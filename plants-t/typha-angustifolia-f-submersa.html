                    <h1>Typha angustifolia f. submersa</h1>
<p>Typha angustifolia f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged bulrush, is a variant of the narrow-leaved cattail.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fully submerged growth habit, with long, cylindrical stems that are often found in shallow water environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically submerged or only partially exposed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted for aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
