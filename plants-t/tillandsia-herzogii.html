                    <h1>Tillandsia herzogii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots, making it well adapted to growing on trees or rocks. It produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom from a central stem, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
