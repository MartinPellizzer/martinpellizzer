                    <h1>Triticum sibiricum</h1>
<p>Triticum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and steppe regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
