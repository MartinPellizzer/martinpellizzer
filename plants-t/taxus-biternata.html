<p>Taxus biternata, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces red, fleshy arils that encase its toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Taxus biternata is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living for several centuries.</p>
<p>It also contains taxanes, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
