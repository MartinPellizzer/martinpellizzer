                    <h1>Triticum × loretii</h1>
<p>Triticum × loretii, commonly known as the hybrid wheat, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Triticum aestivum (common wheat) and Triticum turgidum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex genome structure, which includes contributions from both parent species. This plant exhibits a range of morphological traits, such as spike morphology and grain size, that are intermediate between its parents. It is primarily found in regions where the two parent species overlap geographically.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum × loretii is of interest in plant breeding and evolutionary studies.</p>
