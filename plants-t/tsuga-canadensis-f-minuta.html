                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. minuta</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a compact form of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, conical shape, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely pressed to the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature in the second year.</p>
<p>This variety is more cold-hardy than the typical eastern hemlock, making it adaptable to a range of climates.</p>
