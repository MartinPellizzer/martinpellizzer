<p>Thlaspi montanum subsp.</p>
<p>alpinum, commonly known as alpine cabbages or mountain cabbages, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with tightly packed, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal raceme, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in rocky soils and meadows at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
