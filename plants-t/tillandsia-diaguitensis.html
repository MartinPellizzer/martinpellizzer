                    <h1>Tillandsia diaguitensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia diaguitensis, commonly known as the Diaguita air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
