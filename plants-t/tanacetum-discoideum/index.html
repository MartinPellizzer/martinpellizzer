                            <h1>Tanacetum Discoideum</h1>
<p>Common tansy, scientifically known as Tanacetum discoideum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and strongly aromatic leaves. Often found in meadows and along roadsides, this plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be toxic to livestock if ingested in large quantities. Its presence in natural ecosystems highlights both its ecological value and potential risks.</p>
