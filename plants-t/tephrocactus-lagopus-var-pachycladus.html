<p>Tephrocactus lagopus var. pachycladus, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem that grows upward, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with a distinctive red or purple coloration. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the top of the stem during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
