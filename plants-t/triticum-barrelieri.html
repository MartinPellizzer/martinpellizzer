<p>Triticum barrelieri, commonly known as Barrelier's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. It produces glumes that enclose the florets, a feature typical of many grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying the evolution of wheat species.</p>
