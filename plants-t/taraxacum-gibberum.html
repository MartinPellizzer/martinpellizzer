                    <h1>Taraxacum gibberum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum gibberum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds with feathery parachutes. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Taraxacum gibberum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
