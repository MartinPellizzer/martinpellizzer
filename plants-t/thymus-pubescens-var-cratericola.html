<p>Thymus pubescens var. cratericola, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features wiry stems covered in dense, grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are aromatic, containing essential oils that contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
