<p>It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus.</p>
<p>Taraxacum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
