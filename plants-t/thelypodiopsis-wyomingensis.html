                    <h1>Thelypodiopsis wyomingensis</h1>
<p>Thelypodiopsis wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming bottlebrush, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, cylindrical, reddish-brown stems that resemble bottle brushes. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, and its leaves are scale-like, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Thelypodiopsis wyomingensis is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert shrub communities.</p>
