                    <h1>Tillandsia itatiaiae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flower bracts that can last for several months, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
