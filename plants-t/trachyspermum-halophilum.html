<p>Trachyspermum halophilum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent leaves that help reduce water loss and tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots have adapted to extract and excrete excess salt, allowing it to thrive in challenging soils.</p>
<p>Trachyspermum halophilum is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration projects in saline regions.</p>
