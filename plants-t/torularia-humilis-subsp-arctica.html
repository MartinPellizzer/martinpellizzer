<p>Torularia humilis subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as the Arctic torula, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>It plays a minor but important role in the ecological dynamics of its harsh, polar ecosystems.</p>
