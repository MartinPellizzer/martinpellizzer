                    <h1>Triodia salina</h1>
<p>Triodia salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Triodia salina is often found in saline soils and is adapted to high salt concentrations.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it an important component of native vegetation in coastal and inland salt-affected areas.</p>
