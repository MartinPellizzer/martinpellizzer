<p>Triticum durum subsp.</p>
<p>turanicum, commonly known as the Transcaucasian durum wheat, is a subspecies native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and semi-cushioning spike structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces small, tough grains that are well-suited for durum wheat processing. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and is often cultivated for its high gluten content.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving wheat resilience.</p>
