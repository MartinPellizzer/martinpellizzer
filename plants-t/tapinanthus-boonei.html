                    <h1>Tapinanthus boonei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus boonei, commonly known as the Boone's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often growing on plants like cacti or shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of certain ecological conditions.</p>
