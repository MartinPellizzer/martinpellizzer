                    <h1>Trochocephalus creticus</h1>
<p>Trochocephalus creticus, commonly known as the Cretaceous shield fern, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a distinct rhizome and small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying plant evolution.</p>
