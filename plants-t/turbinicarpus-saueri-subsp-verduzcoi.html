<p>Turbinicarpus saueri subsp.</p>
<p>verduzcoi, commonly known as the Verduzco's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing succulent that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat.</p>
