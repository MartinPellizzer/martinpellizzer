                    <h1>Trymalium leucopogon</h1>
<p>Trymalium leucopogon, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological relationships and limited distribution.</p>
