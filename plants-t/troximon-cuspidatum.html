                    <h1>Troximon cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Troximon cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of a host plant and then attaching itself for sustenance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth and productivity of its host species.</p>
