                    <h1>Triticum repens f. dumetorum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens f. dumetorum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a forage plant and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and dense foliage, which contribute to its ecological and agricultural value.</p>
