<p>Trophaeum rhizophorum, commonly known as the root-attached liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely spaced, leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are often clustered around the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the substrate. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually small and develop from the gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Trophaeum rhizophorum plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecological niche.</p>
