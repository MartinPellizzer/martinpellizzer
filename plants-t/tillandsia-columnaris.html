                    <h1>Tillandsia columnaris</h1>
<p>Tillandsia columnaris, commonly known as the columnar air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features tall, slender stems with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue and bloom in spring or summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia columnaris is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
