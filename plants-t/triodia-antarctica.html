                    <h1>Triodia antarctica</h1>
<p>Triodia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic triodia, is a hardy grass species native to the southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, tough leaves that reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in low, dense clumps, which help it withstand strong winds and extreme temperatures. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Triodia antarctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
