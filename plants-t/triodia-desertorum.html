                    <h1>Triodia desertorum</h1>
<p>Triodia desertorum, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are adapted to the extreme conditions of the desert. Triodia desertorum plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and high temperatures makes it a key component of the Australian desert ecosystem.</p>
