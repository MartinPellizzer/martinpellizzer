                    <h1>Thea olearia</h1>
<p>Thea olearia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its fronds, which give it a striking appearance. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and grows in a compact, bushy form. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, creating a feathery texture.</p>
<p>Thea olearia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shady, moist environments.</p>
