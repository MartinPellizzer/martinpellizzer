<p>Tillandsia huamelulaensis, commonly known as the Huamelula air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and greenhouses.</p>
