The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
