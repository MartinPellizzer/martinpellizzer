                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. boeoticum</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. boeoticum, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild species of wheat native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases, making it one of the smallest wheat genomes. The plant typically grows as a low, compact annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in glumes and are often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for modern wheat varieties.</p>
