                    <h1>Taraxacum brachyeces</h1>
<p>Taraxacum brachyeces, commonly known as the short-haired dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head produces a spherical seed ball covered in fine, white bristles that are easily dispersed by the wind. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
