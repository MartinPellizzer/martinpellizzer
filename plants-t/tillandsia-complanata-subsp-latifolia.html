                    <h1>Tillandsia complanata subsp. latifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia complanata subsp.</p>
<p>latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
