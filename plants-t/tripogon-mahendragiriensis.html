                    <h1>Tripogon mahendragiriensis</h1>
<p>Tripogon mahendragiriensis, commonly known as the Mahendragiri grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, tufted growth and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
