The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Thlaspi spathulatum is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
