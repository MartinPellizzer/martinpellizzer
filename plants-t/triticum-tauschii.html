                    <h1>Triticum tauschii</h1>
<p>Triticum tauschii, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that plays a significant role in wheat genetics.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia, characterized by its slender stems and spikelet-based inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its chromosomes are important in breeding programs for improving wheat traits such as disease resistance and yield.</p>
<p>Triticum tauschii is also valued for its potential in enhancing the genetic diversity of cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
