                    <h1>Tillandsia ramellae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ramellae, commonly known as the ramellae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ramellae is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
