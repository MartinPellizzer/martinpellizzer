<p>Thelypteris malangae var. sitiorum, commonly known as the Malang fern, is a variant of the genus Thelypteris, which belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
