                    <h1>Taraxacum bosniacum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, facilitating its spread over long distances. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Taraxacum bosniacum is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
