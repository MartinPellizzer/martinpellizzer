                    <h1>Taxus dovastonii</h1>
<p>Taxus dovastonii, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value rather than for consumption.</p>
