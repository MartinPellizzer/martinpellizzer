                    <h1>Triticum × palmovae</h1>
<p>Triticum × palmovae, commonly known as the hybrid wheat, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Triticum aestivum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its complex genome structure, which includes contributions from both parental species. This plant is primarily of interest in botanical research due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs. However, it does not produce viable seeds, limiting its agricultural utility.</p>
<p>Its study provides insights into polyploidy and hybridization in cereal crops.</p>
