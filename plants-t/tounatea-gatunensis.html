<p>Tounatea gatunensis, commonly known as the Gatun river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor and spread in freshwater environments. Its spores are released into the water, facilitating reproduction and dispersal.</p>
<p>Tounatea gatunensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
