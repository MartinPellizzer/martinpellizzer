                    <h1>Thea iniquicarpa</h1>
<p>Thea iniquicarpa, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green, almost translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Thea iniquicarpa is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
