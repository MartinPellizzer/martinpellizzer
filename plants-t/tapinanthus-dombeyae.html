                    <h1>Tapinanthus dombeyae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus dombeyae, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant or the ghost flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host roots for water and minerals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical traits make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
