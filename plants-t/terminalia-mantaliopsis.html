<p>Terminalia mantaliopsis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
