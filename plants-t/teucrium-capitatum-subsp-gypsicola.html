<p>Teucrium capitatum subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as gypsum cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, clustered blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those high in gypsum, and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments.</p>
