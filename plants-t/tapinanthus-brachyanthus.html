                    <h1>Tapinanthus brachyanthus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus brachyanthus, commonly known as the parasitic milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds equipped with a silky appendage for wind dispersal.</p>
