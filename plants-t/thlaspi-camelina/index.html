                            <h1>Thlaspi Camelina</h1>
<p>Thlaspi camelina is a hardy flowering plant known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and roadside areas across Europe and parts of Asia. This species is also referred to as the yellow rocket due to its bright yellow flowers. Its resilience makes it a valuable subject in ecological and agricultural studies. Despite its common presence, it remains underappreciated for its ecological contributions.</p>
