                    <h1>Thelocactus bicolor var. pottsii</h1>
<p>Thelocactus bicolor var. pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' whitestick, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
