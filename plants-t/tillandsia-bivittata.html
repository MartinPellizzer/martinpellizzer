                    <h1>Tillandsia bivittata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bivittata, commonly known as the two-striped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through its roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
