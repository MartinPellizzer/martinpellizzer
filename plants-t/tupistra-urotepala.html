                    <h1>Tupistra urotepala</h1>
<p>Tupistra urotepala, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny structure composed of numerous small, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red berries. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ability to thrive in minimal water make it a striking addition to xeriscaping.</p>
