                    <h1>Tylosema</h1>
<p>Tylosema, commonly known as the "sugar bush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their dense, thorny foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are often trifoliate, and the plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain edible seeds. Tylosema species are adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help them survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
