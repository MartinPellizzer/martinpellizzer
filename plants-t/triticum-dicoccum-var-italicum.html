                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. italicum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. italicum, commonly known as Italian spelt, is a ancient grain species belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescence with small, awned florets. The grains are typically hulled, meaning they retain their outer bran layer, which contributes to its nutritional density. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and has a long history of cultivation in Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from modern wheat varieties, with a unique combination of protein composition and flavor profile.</p>
