                    <h1>Taraxacum inundatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum inundatum, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, tall, yellow flowering stem that produces composite flower heads. Native to wetland habitats in South America, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is adapted to waterlogged conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in saturated soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
