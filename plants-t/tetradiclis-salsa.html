<p>Tetradiclis salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Tetradiclis salsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
