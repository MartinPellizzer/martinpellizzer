<p>Thelypteris tannensis, commonly known as the tannic fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Thelypteris tannensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental fronds and is often used in shaded garden landscapes.</p>
