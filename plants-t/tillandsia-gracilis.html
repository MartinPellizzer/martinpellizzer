                    <h1>Tillandsia gracilis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gracilis, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
