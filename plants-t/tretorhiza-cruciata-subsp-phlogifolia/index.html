                            <h1>Tretorhiza Cruciata Subsp. Phlogifolia</h1>
<p>Coralroot, scientifically known as Tretorhiza cruciata subsp. phlogifolia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid that thrives in the shaded, moist environments of forests. This plant is named for its distinctive coral-like appearance, with its pale, fleshy roots and delicate, reddish-pink flowers. Unlike most plants, it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nourishment, making it a unique example of symbiotic relationships in nature. Found primarily in the Pacific Northwest, it is a symbol of ecological balance and biodiversity. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this fragile species from habitat loss and environmental change.</p>
