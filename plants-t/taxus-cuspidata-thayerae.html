<p>Taxus cuspidata thayerae, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a rare and ancient conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and evergreen foliage, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in crosses. The plant produces small, reddish-pink flowers followed by blue-black berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in traditional Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
