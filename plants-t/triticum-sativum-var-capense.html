                    <h1>Triticum sativum var. capense</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum var. capense, commonly known as Cape wheat, is a lesser-known variety of wheat native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are typically used for animal feed rather than human consumption. The plant has a short life cycle, maturing within a few months under suitable climatic conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to arid environments, it has been studied for potential use in drought-resistant agriculture.</p>
