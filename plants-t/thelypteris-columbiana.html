<p>Thelypteris columbiana, commonly known as the Oregon shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris columbiana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals.</p>
