                    <h1>Triglochin alcockiae</h1>
<p>Triglochin alcockiae, commonly known as the Alcock's glassworts, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Triglochin alcockiae is adapted to tolerate high salinity and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
