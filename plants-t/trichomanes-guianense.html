<p>Trichomanes guianense, commonly known as the Guianan clubmoss, is a member of the family Huperziaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophylls are arranged in compact, club-shaped structures.</p>
<p>Trichomanes guianense is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
