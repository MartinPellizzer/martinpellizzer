<p>Toxicodendron radicans subsp.</p>
<p>barkleyi, commonly known as the Southern Poison Ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically glossy and have a slightly notched or serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation in many people.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in wooded areas, along trails, and in disturbed soils, making it a common but potentially hazardous plant in the region.</p>
