                    <h1>Taxus montana</h1>
<p>Taxus montana, commonly known as the western yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, red, berry-like structures called arils, which contain the seeds enclosed in a fleshy coating. Taxus montana is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 200 years.</p>
<p>It contains toxic compounds, such as taxine, which can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
