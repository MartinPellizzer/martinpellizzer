                    <h1>Trichocereus glaucus</h1>
<p>Trichocereus glaucus, commonly known as the "Moon cactus" or "Pachypodium," is a cactus species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are typically short and spiny, providing some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Trichocereus glaucus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
