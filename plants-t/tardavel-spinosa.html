<p>Tardavel spinosa, commonly known as the spiny tardavel, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tardavel spinosa thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
