<p>Tillandsia nizandaensis, commonly known as the Nizanda air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nizandaensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to thrive.</p>
