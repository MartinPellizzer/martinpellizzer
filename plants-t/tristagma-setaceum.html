                    <h1>Tristagma setaceum</h1>
<p>Tristagma setaceum, commonly known as the bristly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant's berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Tristagma setaceum has a unique life cycle, relying on its host for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing to some extent.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study.</p>
