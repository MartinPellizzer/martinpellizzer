<p>Tamarix turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in certain landscapes.</p>
