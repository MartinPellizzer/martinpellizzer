<p>Thelypteris lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lindleyi thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
