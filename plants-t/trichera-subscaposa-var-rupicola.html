                    <h1>Trichera subscaposa var. rupicola</h1>
<p>Trichera subscaposa var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock trichera, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
