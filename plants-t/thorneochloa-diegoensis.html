<p>Thorneochloa diegoensis, commonly known as Diego's thorngrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant features sharp, spiny bracts that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Thorneochloa diegoensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
