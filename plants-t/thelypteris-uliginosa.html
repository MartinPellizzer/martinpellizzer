<p>Thelypteris uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, narrow, upright habit. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called circinate structures. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Thelypteris uliginosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
