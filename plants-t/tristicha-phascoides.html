                    <h1>Tristicha phascoides</h1>
<p>Tristicha phascoides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often appear in a spiral pattern, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces a small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is typically located at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and specialized habitat, Tristicha phascoides is considered a delicate and endangered species in many regions.</p>
