                    <h1>Tambourissa</h1>
<p>Tambourissa, commonly known as the "butterfly pea," is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye due to their vibrant color.</p>
<p>The botanical name *Pueraria mirifica* is sometimes associated with related species, though Tambourissa specifically refers to *Clitoria ternatea*.</p>
