<p>Trifolium wormskioldii var. siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou trifoliate, is a rare and endemic species native to the Siskiyou Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
