                    <h1>Tillandsia edithae var. edithae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia edithae var. edithae, commonly known as the Edith's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
