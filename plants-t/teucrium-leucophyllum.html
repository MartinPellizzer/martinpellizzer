<p>Teucrium leucophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it a valued plant in both ornamental and medicinal horticulture.</p>
