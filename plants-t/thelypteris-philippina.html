<p>Thelypteris philippina, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across wetland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris philippina plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
