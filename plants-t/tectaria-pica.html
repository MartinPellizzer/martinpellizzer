<p>Tectaria pica, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are usually divided into several segments, with a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention.</p>
