                    <h1>Trigonostemon calcicola</h1>
<p>Trigonostemon calcicola, commonly known as the limestone trigonostemon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Trigonostemon calcicola is valued for its ornamental potential and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
