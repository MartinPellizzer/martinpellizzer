<p>Triticum timopheevii subsp.</p>
<p>araraticum, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics. It is a diploid species with a genome size smaller than that of common wheat, contributing to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a slender, grass-like structure with narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving wheat resilience to environmental stress.</p>
