<p>Trichomanes musolense, commonly known as the Musolean huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often clustered fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Trichomanes musolense is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to tolerate periods of drought.</p>
