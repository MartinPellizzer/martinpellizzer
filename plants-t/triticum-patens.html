                    <h1>Triticum patens</h1>
<p>Triticum patens, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic relationship with domesticated wheat species.</p>
