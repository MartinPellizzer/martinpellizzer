                    <h1>Tillandsia subinflata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subinflata, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia subinflata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
