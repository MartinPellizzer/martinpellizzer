                    <h1>Tricholemma</h1>
<p>Tricholemma, commonly known as the outermost layer of the epidermis in certain plants, is a specialized structure composed of a single layer of living cells.</p>
<p>It serves as a protective barrier against environmental stressors such as desiccation and mechanical damage. This layer is particularly prominent in grasses and some dicotyledonous plants. The tricholemma also plays a role in the transport of water and nutrients through its intimate association with the underlying tissues.</p>
<p>Its cellular structure is often reinforced with lignin or other structural polymers, enhancing its durability.</p>
