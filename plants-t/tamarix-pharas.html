                    <h1>Tamarix pharas</h1>
<p>Tamarix pharas, commonly known as the desert rose or tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand long periods of drought.</p>
<p>Tamarix pharas is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
