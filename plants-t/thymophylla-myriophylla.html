                    <h1>Thymophylla myriophylla</h1>
<p>Thymophylla myriophylla, commonly known as the silver pine or silver fir, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its cones are small and often remain on the plant for many years before opening.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
