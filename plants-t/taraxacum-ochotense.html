                    <h1>Taraxacum ochotense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum ochotense, commonly known as the Ochotense dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in areas such as the Russian Far East and parts of China. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head. Its flowers develop into spherical seed heads that release seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
