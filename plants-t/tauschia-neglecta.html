<p>Tauschia neglecta, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Tauschia neglecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
