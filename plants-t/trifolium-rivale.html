                    <h1>Trifolium rivale</h1>
<p>Trifolium rivale, commonly known as water clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Trifolium rivale is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
