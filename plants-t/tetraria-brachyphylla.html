<p>Tetraria brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed tetraria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Tetraria brachyphylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
