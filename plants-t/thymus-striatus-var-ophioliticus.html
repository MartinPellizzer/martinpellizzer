                    <h1>Thymus striatus var. ophioliticus</h1>
<p>Thymus striatus var. ophioliticus, commonly known as the ophiolitic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a grayish-blue hue and produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
<p>The varietal name "ophioliticus" refers to its association with ophiolite formations, which are ultramafic rock complexes.</p>
