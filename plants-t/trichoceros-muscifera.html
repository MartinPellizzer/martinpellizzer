                    <h1>Trichoceros muscifera</h1>
<p>Trichoceros muscifera, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense, velvety coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichoceros muscifera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
