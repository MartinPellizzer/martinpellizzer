<p>Trisetum muticum, commonly known as the small hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Trisetum muticum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
