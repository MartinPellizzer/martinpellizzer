<p>Thelypteris subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris subalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where other plant species struggle to survive.</p>
