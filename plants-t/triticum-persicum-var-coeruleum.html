                    <h1>Triticum persicum var. coeruleum</h1>
<p>Triticum persicum var. coeruleum, commonly known as Persian wheat or blue wheat, is a unique variant of wheat characterized by its striking blue-gray glumes.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include slender, spike-like inflorescences and small, wind-pollinated flowers. The blue hue of its bracts is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are common in certain grass species.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for grain production.</p>
