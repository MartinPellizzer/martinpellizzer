                    <h1>Taraxacum tamesense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum tamesense, commonly known as the Tamese dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a bright yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a white, feathery pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
