<p>Tunilla soehrensii, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in forested areas. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tunilla soehrensii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
