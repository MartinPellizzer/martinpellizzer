                    <h1>Toxicodendron radicans var. divaricatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans var. divaricatum, commonly known as the southern itchleaf or eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the broad-leaf poison ivy.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous vine or shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its trifoliate leaves with three leaflets. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle without protection.</p>
