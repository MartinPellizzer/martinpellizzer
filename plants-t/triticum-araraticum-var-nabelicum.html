                    <h1>Triticum araraticum var. nabelicum</h1>
<p>Triticum araraticum var. nabelicum, commonly known as the Armenian wheat, is a variant of the wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hardy nature, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale blue to green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its grains are generally smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for agricultural research and breeding programs.</p>
