                    <h1>Trifolium andinum var. canone</h1>
<p>Trifolium andinum var. canone, commonly known as the Andean clover, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays an important role in soil enrichment in its native habitat.</p>
