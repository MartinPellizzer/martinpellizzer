<p>Tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed liverwort, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Metaphyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, thalloid structure and lack of true roots, stems, or leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Tetraphyllum species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their small, lobed thallus that can resemble a liver in shape.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in moist habitats.</p>
