<p>Thelypteris depilata, commonly known as the hairless shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris depilata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
