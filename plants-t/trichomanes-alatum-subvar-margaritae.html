                    <h1>Trichomanes alatum subvar. margaritae</h1>
<p>Trichomanes alatum subvar. margaritae, commonly known as the Margarita water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a lacy appearance, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the water fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
