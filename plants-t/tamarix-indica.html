                    <h1>Tamarix indica</h1>
<p>Tamarix indica, commonly known as the salt cedar or desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, gray-green foliage and pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and saline environments. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it useful for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
