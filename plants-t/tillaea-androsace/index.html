                            <h1>Tillaea Androsace</h1>
<p>Androsace snowplant, scientifically known as Tillaea androsace, is a rare and delicate alpine flower found in the high mountain regions of Europe and western Asia. This low-growing plant is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves and its clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Thriving in cold, rocky habitats, it is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, the species is considered vulnerable. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and beautiful plant from further decline.</p>
