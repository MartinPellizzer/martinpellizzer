                    <h1>Triaristellina tridactylites</h1>
<p>Triaristellina tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed trilobite, is an extinct marine arthropod that lived during the Cambrian period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Trilobitida, characterized by its segmented exoskeleton and distinct body divisions. The species is notable for its three pairs of thoracic legs, which are often preserved in fossil records. Its morphology provides valuable insights into early animal evolution and paleoecology.</p>
<p>Triaristellina tridactylites is a key index fossil for dating and correlating Cambrian rock layers.</p>
