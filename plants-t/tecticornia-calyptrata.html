                    <h1>Tecticornia calyptrata</h1>
<p>Tecticornia calyptrata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed and saline soils. Tecticornia calyptrata is well adapted to high salinity and low rainfall, making it a key component of coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots stabilize sand dunes, playing a vital role in preventing erosion.</p>
