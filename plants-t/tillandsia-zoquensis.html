                    <h1>Tillandsia zoquensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zoquensis, commonly known as the Zoque air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia zoquensis is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
