<p>Tilia platyphyllos f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a compact, slow-growing tree or shrub with a columnar growth habit.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the species Tilia platyphyllos. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for small gardens or as a specimen plant due to its upright form and ornamental value.</p>
