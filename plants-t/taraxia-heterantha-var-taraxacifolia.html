<p>Taraxia heterantha var. taraxacifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar floral structure.</p>
