                    <h1>Triodia contorta</h1>
<p>Triodia contorta, commonly known as spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and sharp, spiny leaves that help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant forms tussocks and is often found in sandy soils, particularly in the inland regions of Western Australia. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
<p>Triodia contorta is well adapted to drought and fire, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
