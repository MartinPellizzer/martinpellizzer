<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>tricoccum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases, making it one of the smallest cereal genomes.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, upright stems with long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains. Its botanical features include a compact inflorescence and a unique glume structure that distinguishes it from other wheat species.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is valued for its high protein content and ancient grain qualities, contributing to its significance in both agricultural and archaeological studies.</p>
