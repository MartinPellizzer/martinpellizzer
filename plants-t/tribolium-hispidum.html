<p>Tribolium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy weevil, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant it is associated with, likely a flowering plant, serves as both a host and a food source for the beetle's larvae. Tribolium hispidum is often found in agricultural settings where its host plants are cultivated.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult, with the larvae primarily feeding on the host plant's seeds or leaves.</p>
