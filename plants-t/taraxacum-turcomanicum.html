<p>Taraxacum turcomanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
