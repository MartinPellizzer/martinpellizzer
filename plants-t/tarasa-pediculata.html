                    <h1>Tarasa pediculata</h1>
<p>Tarasa pediculata, commonly known as the bluebell orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
