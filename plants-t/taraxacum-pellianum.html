After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head, or "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
