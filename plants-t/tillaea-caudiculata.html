                    <h1>Tillaea caudiculata</h1>
<p>Tillaea caudiculata, commonly known as the cushion tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Tillaea caudiculata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
