                    <h1>Tillandsia capillaris var. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia capillaris var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on its leaves, which helps in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a soft, fuzzy texture that distinguishes it from other Tillandsia species.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among growers for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
