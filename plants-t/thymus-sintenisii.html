                    <h1>Thymus sintenisii</h1>
<p>Thymus sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis thyme, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and square stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its tiny, pink or white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
