                    <h1>Thismia yorkensis</h1>
<p>Thismia yorkensis, commonly known as the York Island ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote York Island in the Torres Strait.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Thismiaceae family, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. The plant produces small, white, lantern-like flowers that emit a faint glow, a feature that has intrigued botanists. Its unique morphology and symbiotic relationships make it a subject of ongoing scientific study.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
