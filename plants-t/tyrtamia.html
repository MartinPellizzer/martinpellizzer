                    <h1>Tyrtamia</h1>
<p>Tyrtamia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Tyrtamia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
