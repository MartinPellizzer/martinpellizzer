                    <h1>Tillandsia schumanniana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
