<p>Toxosiphon macropodus, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a marine plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that are adapted to thrive in coastal environments. The plant is found in shallow tidal zones and is often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its structure allows it to retain moisture and withstand salt exposure, making it a resilient species in intertidal habitats.</p>
<p>Toxosiphon macropodus plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
