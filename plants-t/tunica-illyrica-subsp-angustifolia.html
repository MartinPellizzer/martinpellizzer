<p>Tunica illyrica subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tunica, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
