                    <h1>Taxotrophis crenata</h1>
<p>Taxotrophis crenata, commonly known as the wavy leaf fern, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant's leaves are typically wavy or undulating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Taxotrophis crenata is often found in shaded, moist habitats where it can anchor itself to rocks or submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
