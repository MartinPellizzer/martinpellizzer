<p>Tricera gonoclada, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Tricera gonoclada produces cones, with the female cones typically appearing at the base of the plant and the male cones emerging from the upper part of the stem.</p>
