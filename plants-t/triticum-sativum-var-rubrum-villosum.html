                    <h1>Triticum sativum var. rubrum-villosum</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum var. rubrum-villosum, commonly known as red hairy wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive red husk and hairy awns.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its robust grain and adaptability to various climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and compact spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure that supports the development of its grains.</p>
<p>The red coloration of the husk is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which contribute to its unique appearance and potential nutritional value.</p>
