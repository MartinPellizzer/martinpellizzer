                    <h1>Tillandsia barthlottii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia barthlottii, commonly known as the Barthlott's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, white coating of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia barthlottii is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
