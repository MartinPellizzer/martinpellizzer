                    <h1>Trichomanes bipunctatum var. venulosum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes bipunctatum var. venulosum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that often have a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on mossy rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its unique venulose pattern on the fronds gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other similar species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often sought after in conservation efforts.</p>
