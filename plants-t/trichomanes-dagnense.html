                    <h1>Trichomanes dagnense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes dagnense, commonly known as the Dagnes water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns, though it is not typically aquatic. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichomanes dagnense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
