                    <h1>Taeniophyllum neotorricellense</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum neotorricellense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is often found in specific microhabitats with particular host tree species.</p>
