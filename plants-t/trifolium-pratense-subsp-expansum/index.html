<p>Red clover, scientifically known as Trifolium pratense subsp. expansum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is widely cultivated for its nutritional value and is often used in forage and as a cover crop. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Red clover contains compounds that may support human health, including isoflavones with potential hormonal effects. Its versatility makes it a valuable resource in agriculture and traditional medicine.</p>
