                    <h1>Tilia cinerea</h1>
<p>Tilia cinerea, commonly known as the grey linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale grey bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Tilia cinerea is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance.</p>
