                    <h1>Taraxacum slovacum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum slovacum, commonly known as the Slovak dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Taraxacum slovacum is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
