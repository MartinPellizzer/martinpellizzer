                    <h1>Tragia impedita</h1>
<p>Tragia impedita, commonly known as the spiny beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems covered in stiff, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Tragia impedita thrives in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the plant's tendency to cling to clothing and animal fur due to its hooked bracts.</p>
