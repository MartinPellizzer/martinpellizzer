                    <h1>Tillandsia rhodochlamys</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rhodochlamys, commonly known as the red-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and striking red or orange inflorescence that blooms during the dry season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
