                    <h1>Tinea maculata</h1>
<p>Tinea maculata, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus with distinct, rounded, and often clustered lobes. The plant typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in humid environments, forming a crust-like or foliose structure. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are scattered across the thallus and aid in asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The lichen is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
