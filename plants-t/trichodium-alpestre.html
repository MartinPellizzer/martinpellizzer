                    <h1>Trichodium alpestre</h1>
<p>Trichodium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine trichodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its leaves are usually evergreen, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Trichodium alpestre is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
