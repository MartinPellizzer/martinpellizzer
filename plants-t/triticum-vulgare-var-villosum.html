                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. villosum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. villosum, commonly known as hairy wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its hairy or pubescent glumes and lemma.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that contain several florets. Its inflorescence is usually a panicle, and the seeds are enclosed in small, tough husks.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than other wheat types but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
