                    <h1>Taeniophyllum ficicola</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum ficicola, commonly known as the parasitic fig fern, is a unique plant that exhibits a parasitic lifestyle, attaching itself to the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its reduced morphology, with small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense, instead relying on its host for nutrients. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is primarily as a parasite, influencing the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
