                    <h1>Thelypteris × boottii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × boottii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris calomoda and Thelypteris jamaicensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris × boottii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
