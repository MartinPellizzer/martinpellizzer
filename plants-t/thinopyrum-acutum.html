<p>Thinopyrum acutum, commonly known as the acutely pointed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Thinopyrum acutum is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement.</p>
