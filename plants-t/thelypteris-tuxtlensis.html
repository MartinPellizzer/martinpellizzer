<p>Thelypteris tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtl√°n holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
