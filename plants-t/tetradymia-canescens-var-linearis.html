<p>Tetradymia canescens var. linearis, commonly known as the linear tetradymia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its linear, gray-green leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small yellow flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape compared to the typical form of Tetradymia canescens.</p>
