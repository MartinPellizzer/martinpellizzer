<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrata" suggests a smooth, hairless surface. It produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
