                <h1>Triaenacanthus glandulifera</h1>
<p>Triaenacanthus glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which are followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to play a role in water retention and defense against herbivores.</p>
