<p>Trichodiadema calvatum, commonly known as the nakedleaf ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Trichodiadema calvatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
