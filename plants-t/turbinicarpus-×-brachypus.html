                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × brachypus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × brachypus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a rare and unique hybrid resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus macdowellii and Turbinicarpus brachypus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stem that resembles a cactus fruit, which is actually a modified stem called a caudex. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the spring season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is primarily cultivated by growers.</p>
