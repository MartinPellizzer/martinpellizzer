<p>Trymalium serpyllaceum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by dry, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and during periods of drought.</p>
<p>Trymalium serpyllaceum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
