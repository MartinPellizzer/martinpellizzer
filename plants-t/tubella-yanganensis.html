                    <h1>Tubella yanganensis</h1>
<p>Tubella yanganensis, commonly known as the Yanganensis Tubella, is a rare and unique species of sponge-like organism belonging to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, porous structure and specialized cells called choanocytes, which play a crucial role in water filtration. This species is typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. Its habitat is often associated with specific substrates, such as rocky or sandy bottoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Tubella yanganensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
