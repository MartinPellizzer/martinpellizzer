                    <h1>Triticum desertorum</h1>
<p>Triticum desertorum, commonly known as desert wheat, is a wild grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is of interest for research into climate-resilient crops.</p>
