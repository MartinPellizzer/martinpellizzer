                    <h1>Thlaspi andicola var. glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Thlaspi andicola var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountain conditions and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
