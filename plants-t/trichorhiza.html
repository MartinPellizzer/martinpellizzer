                    <h1>Trichorhiza</h1>
<p>Trichorhiza, commonly known as the "spike moss," is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Trichopodaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate stature and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Trichorhiza species typically have a protonema stage, which is a filamentous structure that develops into the mature plant. Their leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral, and they lack true roots, instead having rhizoids for anchoring.</p>
<p>These mosses play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems.</p>
