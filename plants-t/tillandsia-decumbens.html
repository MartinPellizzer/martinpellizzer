                    <h1>Tillandsia decumbens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia decumbens, commonly known as the groundhugging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
