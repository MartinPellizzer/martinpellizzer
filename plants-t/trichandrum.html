<p>Trichandrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Trichandrum is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
