                    <h1>Tillandsia stenoura var. stenoura</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stenoura var. stenoura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
