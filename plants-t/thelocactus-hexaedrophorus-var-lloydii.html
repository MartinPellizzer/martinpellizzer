                    <h1>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. lloydii</h1>
<p>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's thorn cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
