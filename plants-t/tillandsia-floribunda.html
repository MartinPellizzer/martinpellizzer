                    <h1>Tillandsia floribunda</h1>
<p>Tillandsia floribunda, commonly known as the showy airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant produces striking clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia floribunda is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
