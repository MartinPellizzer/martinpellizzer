                    <h1>Thurya capitata</h1>
<p>Thurya capitata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a head, giving it a daisy-like appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Thurya capitata is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
