                    <h1>Typha angustifolia var. calumetensis</h1>
<p>Typha angustifolia var. calumetensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the broadleaf cattail native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that transitions from yellow to brown as it matures. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
