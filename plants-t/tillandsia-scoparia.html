                    <h1>Tillandsia scoparia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia scoparia, commonly known as the silver vulture orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-white foliage that gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are typically short-lived.</p>
<p>Tillandsia scoparia is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth.</p>
