                    <h1>Taraxacum cantabricum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is less commonly used than other dandelion species.</p>
