                    <h1>Thalictrum fortunei var. bulbiliferum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum fortunei var. bulbiliferum, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to China.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bulbils, which are small vegetative propagules, allowing it to spread readily in suitable habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
