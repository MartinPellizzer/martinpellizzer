<p>Tolpis succulenta subsp.</p>
<p>filiformis, commonly known as the slender leaf cholla, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spine-tipped tubercles, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. Tolpis succulenta subsp.</p>
<p>filiformis is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
