                    <h1>Tripsacum dactyloides var. lemmonii</h1>
<p>Tripsacum dactyloides var. lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wild millet, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
