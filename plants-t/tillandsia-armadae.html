                    <h1>Tillandsia armadae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia armadae, commonly known as the Armada air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
