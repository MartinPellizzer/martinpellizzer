                    <h1>Typha domingensis var. angustata</h1>
<p>Typha domingensis var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower heads.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater marshes and along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces a distinctive brown, mat-like structure that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
