                    <h1>Temnadenia xanthostoma</h1>
<p>Temnadenia xanthostoma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees, typically through specialized roots that attach to the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
