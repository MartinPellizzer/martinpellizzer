<p>Tarachia lacera, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are small, succulent, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tarachia lacera plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert environments.</p>
