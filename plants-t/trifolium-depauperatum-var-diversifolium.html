                    <h1>Trifolium depauperatum var. diversifolium</h1>
<p>Trifolium depauperatum var. diversifolium, commonly known as the variable clover, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the clover genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring leaves with varying numbers of leaflets, typically three, but sometimes more. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often found in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle floral display.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential role in ecological studies of plant adaptation.</p>
