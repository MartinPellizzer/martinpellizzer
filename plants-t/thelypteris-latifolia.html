<p>Thelypteris latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or upright, with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across eastern North America. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
