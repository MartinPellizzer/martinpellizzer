<p>Tillandsia juruana, commonly known as the Juruana air plant, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often red or orange in color.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
