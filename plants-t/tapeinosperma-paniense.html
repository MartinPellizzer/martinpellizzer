                    <h1>Tapeinosperma paniense</h1>
<p>Tapeinosperma paniense, commonly known as the Pani√© tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the humid forests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy of elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential economic value, though it remains relatively understudied in scientific literature.</p>
