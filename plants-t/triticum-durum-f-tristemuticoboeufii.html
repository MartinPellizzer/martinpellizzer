                    <h1>Triticum durum f. tristemuticoboeufii</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. tristemuticoboeufii, commonly known as the Boeufii durum wheat form, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique genetic traits.</p>
<p>This form exhibits distinct morphological features, including a compact growth habit and reduced spike length compared to standard durum wheat varieties. It is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are typically narrower and more rigid, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it serves as a valuable resource for breeding programs aiming to enhance drought tolerance and yield stability.</p>
