<p>Taeniophyllum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum flaccidum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
