<p>Tanacetum argyraeum, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
