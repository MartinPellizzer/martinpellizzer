                    <h1>Tetrorchidium congolense</h1>
<p>Tetrorchidium congolense, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display vivid colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
