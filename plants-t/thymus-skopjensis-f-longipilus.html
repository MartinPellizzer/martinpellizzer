                    <h1>Thymus skopjensis f. longipilus</h1>
<p>Thymus skopjensis f. longipilus, commonly known as the long-haired thyme, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Skopje region of North Macedonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
