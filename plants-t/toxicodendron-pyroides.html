<p>Toxicodendron pyroides, commonly known as the African lacquer tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It is known for its ability to exude a sticky, resinous substance from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
