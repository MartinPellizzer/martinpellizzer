                    <h1>Tilia variegata</h1>
<p>Tilia variegata, commonly known as the variegated linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which often display a striking variegation of white and green patterns. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are an important food source for pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters.</p>
<p>The wood is soft and lightweight, making it useful for carving and other crafts.</p>
