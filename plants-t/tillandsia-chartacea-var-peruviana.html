                    <h1>Tillandsia chartacea var. peruviana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chartacea var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant features dense, overlapping leaf rosettes that trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
