<p>Thelypteris grandis var. grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its sori, which contain the spores, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
