<p>Tithymalus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping tithymale, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tithymalus fruticosus is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
