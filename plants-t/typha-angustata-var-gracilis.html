                    <h1>Typha angustata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Typha angustata var. gracilis, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, brown, canoe-shaped seeds that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished from other cattail species by its narrower leaves and slightly different flowering structure.</p>
