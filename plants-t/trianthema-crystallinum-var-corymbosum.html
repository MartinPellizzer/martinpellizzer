                    <h1>Trianthema crystallinum var. corymbosum</h1>
<p>Trianthema crystallinum var. corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered glassy goosefoot, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of its varietal name "corymbosum.". Its crystalline appearance is due to the presence of calcified structures on the leaves, which reflect light and give it a glassy look.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
