                    <h1>Tragacantha brandegeei</h1>
<p>Tragacantha brandegeei, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, similar to that of other tragacanth species, which has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha brandegeei is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
