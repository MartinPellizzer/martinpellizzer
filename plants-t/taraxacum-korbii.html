                    <h1>Taraxacum korbii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum korbii, commonly known as the Korbi's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, spiky seed dispersal structure called a pappus. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range.</p>
