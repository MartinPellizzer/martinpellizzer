                    <h1>Tetraria ferruginea</h1>
<p>Tetraria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tetraria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to reddish in color, with a distinct, granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on bark and wood in temperate regions, particularly in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Tetraria ferruginea is notable for its chemical composition, which includes depsides and other secondary metabolites that aid in its survival and ecological interactions.</p>
