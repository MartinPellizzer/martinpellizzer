                    <h1>Trimorpha intermedia</h1>
<p>Trimorpha intermedia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to white. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trimorpha intermedia plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
