<p>Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>nigriceps, commonly known as the black-headed seaside dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and stems that rise to produce a single, yellow composite flower head.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dark brown to black flower head, which contrasts with the bright yellow ray florets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
