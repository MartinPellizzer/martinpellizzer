<p>Trochomeriopsis, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous plants. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or dissected, and their flowers are composite, consisting of ray and disk florets. Trochomeriopsis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
