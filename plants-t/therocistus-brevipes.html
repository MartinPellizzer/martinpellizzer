                    <h1>Therocistus brevipes</h1>
<p>Therocistus brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem that is typically green and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Therocistus brevipes is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
