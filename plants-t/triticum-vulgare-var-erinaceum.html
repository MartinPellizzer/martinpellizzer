                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. erinaceum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. erinaceum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and distinctive hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous bracts, which contain the edible grains. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Despite its wild nature, it has been historically used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop.</p>
