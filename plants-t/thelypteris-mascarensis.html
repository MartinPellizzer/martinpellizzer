<p>Thelypteris mascarensis, commonly known as the Mascarene shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris mascarensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
