                    <h1>Taxus baccata f. semperaurea</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata f. semperaurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a unique variant of the common yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the standard Taxus baccata. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain populations of the plant. The leaves are narrow and needle-like, typical of the yew family, but their coloration makes it visually distinct.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
