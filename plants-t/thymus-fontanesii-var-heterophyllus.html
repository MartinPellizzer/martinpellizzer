                    <h1>Thymus fontanesii var. heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Thymus fontanesii var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
