                    <h1>Triticum fibrosum</h1>
<p>Triticum fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains, typical of many cereal species. It is often found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous structure, it has been historically used for both grain and fiber production.</p>
