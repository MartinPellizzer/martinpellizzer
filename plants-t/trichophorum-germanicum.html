                    <h1>Trichophorum germanicum</h1>
<p>Trichophorum germanicum, commonly known as the German hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Trichophorum germanicum is often found in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is an indicator species for wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
