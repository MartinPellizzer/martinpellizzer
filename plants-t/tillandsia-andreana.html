                    <h1>Tillandsia andreana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia andreana, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and orange.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to humid, high-altitude environments.</p>
