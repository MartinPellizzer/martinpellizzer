                    <h1>Tapeinia deusta</h1>
<p>Tapeinia deusta, commonly known as the mistletoe of the oak, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on Quercus species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees are abundant.</p>
<p>Tapeinia deusta plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and bird species.</p>
