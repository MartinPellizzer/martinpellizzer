<p>Thelypteris pteroidea, commonly known as the fan-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a fan, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its propagation and anchoring in soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
