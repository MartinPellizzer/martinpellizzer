                    <h1>Tessaria</h1>
<p>Tessaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Tessaria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
