                    <h1>Triticum sativum subvar. candidissimum</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum subvar. candidissimum, commonly known as white wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its pale, almost white grain.</p>
<p>This subvariety is typically smaller in size compared to other wheat types and has a lower protein content, which affects its baking properties. It is primarily cultivated for its high starch content, making it suitable for certain food products like noodles and pastries. The plant exhibits typical wheat morphology, with spikelets and awns, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader wheat gene pool, offering potential for breeding programs.</p>
