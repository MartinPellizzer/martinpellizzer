                    <h1>Tapinanthus landanaensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus landanaensis, commonly known as the Landana dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central America and is typically found growing on the branches of host trees such as Ficus species. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
