                    <h1>Timonius belensis</h1>
<p>Timonius belensis, commonly known as the Belensian timon, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Belgian Ardennes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in the rocky soil of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Timonius belensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
