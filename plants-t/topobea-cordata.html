                    <h1>Topobea cordata</h1>
<p>Topobea cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along creek beds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling.</p>
