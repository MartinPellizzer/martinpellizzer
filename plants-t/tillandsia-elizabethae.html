<p>Tillandsia elizabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia elizabethae is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to humid, shaded environments.</p>
