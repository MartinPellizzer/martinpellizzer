                    <h1>Thelypteris pachyrhachis var. sprucei</h1>
<p>Thelypteris pachyrhachis var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to elliptic-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
