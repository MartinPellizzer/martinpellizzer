                    <h1>Triticum × rouxii</h1>
<p>Triticum × rouxii, commonly known as rye-grain hybrid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between rye (Secale cereale) and wheat (Triticum aestivum).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphology, combining features of both parent species, such as the grass-like appearance of rye and the spike structure of wheat. This plant is primarily cultivated for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions. It produces small, dark grains that are typically used in animal feed or as a forage crop.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Triticum × rouxii lies in its role in plant genetics and breeding programs aimed at improving wheat varieties.</p>
