                    <h1>Trichomanes savaiense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes savaiense, commonly known as the Savaii fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, epiphytic ferns typically found in humid tropical environments. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in shaded, moist microhabitats on tree trunks and rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
