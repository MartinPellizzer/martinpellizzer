<p>Trichonema purpurascens var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
