<p>Triodia avenacea var. longearistata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the vegetation in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
