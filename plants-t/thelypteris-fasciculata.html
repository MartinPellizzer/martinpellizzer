<p>Thelypteris fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Thelypteris fasciculata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
