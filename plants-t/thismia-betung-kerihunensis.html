                    <h1>Thismia betung-kerihunensis</h1>
<p>Thismia betung-kerihunensis, commonly known as the Betung-Kerihun Thismia, is an unusual flowering plant native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Thismiaceae, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are often hidden among the leaf litter. It is a rare and elusive species, with very limited distribution and minimal genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
