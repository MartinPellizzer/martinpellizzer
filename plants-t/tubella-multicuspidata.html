                    <h1>Tubella multicuspidata</h1>
<p>Tubella multicuspidata, commonly known as the multicuspidate tubella, is a species of marine sponge belonging to the family Tethyidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body with a porous surface that allows for water flow through its skeletal structure. The sponge's skeleton is composed of spicules, which are fine, needle-like structures that provide support and defense. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
