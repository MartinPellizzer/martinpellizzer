                    <h1>Tamaricaria</h1>
<p>Tamaricaria, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Tamaricaria is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, often thriving in coastal dunes and sandy shores.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
