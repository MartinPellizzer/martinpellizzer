                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides var. pancicii</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides var. pancicii, commonly known as Pancici's wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. It is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and crop improvement.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
