                    <h1>Trichomanes rigidum var. firmulum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes rigidum var. firmulum, commonly known as the firm-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is typically found in rocky or mossy areas. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves, which are usually only a few centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
