                    <h1>Tunica carthusianorum</h1>
<p>Tunica carthusianorum, commonly known as the Carthusian monk's tunic, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles the coarse fabric of medieval monastic robes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle aesthetic to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
