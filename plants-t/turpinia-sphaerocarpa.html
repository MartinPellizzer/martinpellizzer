                    <h1>Turpinia sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Turpinia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese tamarisk or the red tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Turpinia sphaerocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
