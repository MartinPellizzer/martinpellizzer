                    <h1>Trigonopterum laricifolium</h1>
<p>Trigonopterum laricifolium, commonly known as the white pine lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly white pines.</p>
<p>It has a pale to bright green thallus with a slightly wrinkled surface and a distinct, often lobed margin. The lichen contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It is commonly found in temperate regions where white pines are prevalent.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an indicator species for certain environmental conditions.</p>
