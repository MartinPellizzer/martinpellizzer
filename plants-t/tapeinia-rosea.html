                    <h1>Tapeinia rosea</h1>
<p>Tapeinia rosea, commonly known as the rose smut, is a fungal plant pathogen that infects roses.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ustilaginaceae and causes a type of smut disease characterized by the production of black, powdery spores on the plant's stems and leaves. The fungus overwinters in the soil and spreads through infected plant material, spores, or contaminated tools. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and can significantly weaken the host plant, leading to reduced growth and flower production.</p>
<p>Management typically involves removing infected plants, improving air circulation, and using fungicides when necessary.</p>
