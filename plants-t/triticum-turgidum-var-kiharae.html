                    <h1>Triticum turgidum var. kiharae</h1>
<p>Triticum turgidum var. kiharae, commonly known as Kihara's wheat, is a lesser-known variant of the wheat genus Triticum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its slender stalks and elongated leaves. This variety is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly in Japan and China. It possesses a diploid genome, which distinguishes it from other wheat species.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and biodiversity.</p>
