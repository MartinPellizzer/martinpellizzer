                    <h1>Tragacantha multijuga</h1>
<p>Tragacantha multijuga, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a thick, resinous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha multijuga is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its economic importance in the production of gum arabic.</p>
