                    <h1>Taeniatherum caput-medusae</h1>
<p>Taeniatherum caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has feathery, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from the appearance of its flower heads, which resemble a crown.</p>
