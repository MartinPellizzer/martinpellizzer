                    <h1>Tillandsia floresensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia floresensis, commonly known as the Flores air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the island of Flores in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces clusters of small, white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps collect moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia floresensis is adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
