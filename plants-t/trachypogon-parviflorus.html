                    <h1>Trachypogon parviflorus</h1>
<p>Trachypogon parviflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Trachypogon parviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
