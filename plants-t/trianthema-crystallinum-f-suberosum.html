                    <h1>Trianthema crystallinum f. suberosum</h1>
<p>Trianthema crystallinum f. suberosum, commonly known as the crystalline trianthema, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the cooler months. Its suberized stem surface provides additional protection against desiccation and herbivory.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
