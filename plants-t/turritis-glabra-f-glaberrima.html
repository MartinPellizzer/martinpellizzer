<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a dense, compact growth habit that helps it thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
