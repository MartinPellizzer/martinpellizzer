<p>Thoracostachyum balansae var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny growth, which provide structural support and protection. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments.</p>
