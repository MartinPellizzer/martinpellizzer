<p>Thelypteris strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris strigillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage.</p>
