                    <h1>Tillandsia pomacochae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pomacochae, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect and retain moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pomacochae is adapted to cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
