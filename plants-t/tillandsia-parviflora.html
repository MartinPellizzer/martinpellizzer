                    <h1>Tillandsia parviflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia parviflora is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
