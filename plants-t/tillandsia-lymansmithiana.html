                    <h1>Tillandsia lymansmithiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lymansmithiana, commonly known as the Lymansmith's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
