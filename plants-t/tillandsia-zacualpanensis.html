<p>Tillandsia zacualpanensis, commonly known as the Zacualpan airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with tightly packed, grass-like leaves that help retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
