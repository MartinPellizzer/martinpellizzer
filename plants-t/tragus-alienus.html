                    <h1>Tragus alienus</h1>
<p>Tragus alienus, commonly known as the alien thorn, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, spiky foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Native to arid regions, it has adapted to thrive in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its leaves are modified into sharp, needle-like structures that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often going unnoticed due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its unassuming nature, Tragus alienus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing shelter for small desert creatures.</p>
