                    <h1>Taeniophyllum parhamiae</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum parhamiae, commonly known as the small-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for various birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
