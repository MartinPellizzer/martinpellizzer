                    <h1>Thymus parnassicus</h1>
<p>Thymus parnassicus, commonly known as Parnassian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, tiny, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, contribute to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Thymus parnassicus is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common in commercial cultivation compared to other thyme species.</p>
