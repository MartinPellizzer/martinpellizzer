<p>Terminalia catappa var. rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and its ability to thrive in saline water, making it an essential component of coastal ecosystems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically alternate and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in traditional medicine and for its durable timber.</p>
