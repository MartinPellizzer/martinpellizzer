                    <h1>Tillandsia neglecta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia neglecta, commonly known as the common air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia neglecta is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and can thrive in indirect light.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to store water in its leaves makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening.</p>
