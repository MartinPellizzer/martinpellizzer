<p>Trixis pterocaulis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trixis pterocaulis is well adapted to hot, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
