                    <h1>Tectaria harlandii</h1>
<p>Tectaria harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
