The plant features long, arching stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically elongated and革质 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum obcordilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
