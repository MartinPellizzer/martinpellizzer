<p>Tamarix africana, commonly known as the African tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix africana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
