                    <h1>Tillandsia nappii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nappii, commonly known as the Nappi air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia nappii produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
