                    <h1>Taraxacum karakoricum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum karakoricum, commonly known as the Karakoram dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
