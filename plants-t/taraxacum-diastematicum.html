<p>Taraxacum diastematicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stem and deeply lobed, grass-like leaves that are narrower than those of common dandelions. The plant produces a single, hollow, explosive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum diastaticum is a perennial herb that typically blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
