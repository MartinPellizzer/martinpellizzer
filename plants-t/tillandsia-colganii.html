                    <h1>Tillandsia colganii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia colganii, commonly known as the Colganâ€™s air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
