                    <h1>Trichotosia hapalostachys</h1>
<p>Trichotosia hapalostachys, commonly known as the hairy leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to its host. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions with humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
