<p>Thelypteris nitida, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that have a velvety texture due to the presence of dense trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
