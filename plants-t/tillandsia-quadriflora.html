                    <h1>Tillandsia quadriflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
