                    <h1>Tetraberlinia</h1>
<p>Tetraberlinia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in a wide range of colors. Tetraberlinia species typically thrive in humid, well-drained soils and require indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. They are popular houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Tetraberlinia maculata and Tetraberlinia schweinfurthii, which are prized for their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit.</p>
