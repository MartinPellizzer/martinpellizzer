<p>Thelypteris grantii, commonly known as the Grant's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the wet tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Thelypteris grantii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
