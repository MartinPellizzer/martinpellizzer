                    <h1>Tamonea fulva</h1>
<p>Tamonea fulva, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its bark and wood are valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
