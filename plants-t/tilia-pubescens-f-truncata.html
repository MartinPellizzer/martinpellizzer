                    <h1>Tilia pubescens f. truncata</h1>
<p>Tilia pubescens f. truncata, commonly known as the truncated-leaf linden, is a botanical variant of the linden tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Tilia pubescens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish, with a subtle fragrance when crushed.</p>
