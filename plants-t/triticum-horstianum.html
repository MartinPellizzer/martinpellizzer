                    <h1>Triticum horstianum</h1>
<p>Triticum horstianum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains, which are typically not cultivated for food but are studied for their genetic diversity. Triticum horstianum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates.</p>
<p>Its genetic material is valuable for improving the resilience and yield of modern wheat varieties.</p>
