<p>Trapa krauselii, commonly known as the narrowleaf water chestnut, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Trapaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the surface. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruits, which are edible, are enclosed in a spiky husk and can remain buoyant for extended periods.</p>
