                    <h1>Tillandsia albertiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia albertiana, commonly known as the Albert's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically silver-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or purple.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
