                    <h1>Taxus baccata var. lutea</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata var. lutea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare variant of the common yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the standard Taxus baccata. The plant is evergreen, with small, scale-like leaves and produces red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique coloration.</p>
