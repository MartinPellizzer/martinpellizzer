                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides f. robusta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides f. robusta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, hair-like structures called trichomes. This variety is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, green filaments that can grow on trees, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host plant.</p>
