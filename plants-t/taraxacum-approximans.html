                    <h1>Taraxacum approximans</h1>
<p>Taraxacum approximans, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This plant is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
