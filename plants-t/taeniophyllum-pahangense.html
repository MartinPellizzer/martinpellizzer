<p>Taeniophyllum pahangense, commonly known as the Pahang fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and limited geographical distribution.</p>
