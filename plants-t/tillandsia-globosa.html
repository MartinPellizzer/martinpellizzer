                    <h1>Tillandsia globosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia globosa, commonly known as the globular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a compact, globe-like structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its leaves are covered in trichomes, specialized structures that absorb water and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia globosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
