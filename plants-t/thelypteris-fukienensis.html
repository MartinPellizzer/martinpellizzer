<p>Thelypteris fukienensis, commonly known as the Fukien holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris fukienensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
