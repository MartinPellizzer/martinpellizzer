<p>Terrellia, scientifically known as Terrellia, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family. These plants are native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Terrellia species are characterized by their delicate, aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers that often bloom in shades of white or pale pink. They are often found growing in rocky or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Due to their unique appearance and ecological significance, Terrellia plants are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
