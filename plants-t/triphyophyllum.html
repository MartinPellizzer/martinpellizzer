                    <h1>Triphyophyllum</h1>
<p>Triphyophyllum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called bladders that trap and digest insects. The plant's stems are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments where it can supplement its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unusual appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
