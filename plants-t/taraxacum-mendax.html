                    <h1>Taraxacum mendax</h1>
<p>Taraxacum mendax, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>While similar to true dandelions, it can be distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter stems.</p>
