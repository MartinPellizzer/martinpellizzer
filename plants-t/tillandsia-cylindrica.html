                    <h1>Tillandsia cylindrica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
