<p>Tillandsia strobeliae, commonly known as the Strobel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Tillandsia strobeliae is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
