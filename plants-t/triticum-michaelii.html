                    <h1>Triticum michaelii</h1>
<p>Triticum michaelii, commonly known as Michael's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup may offer insights into the evolution of modern wheat species.</p>
