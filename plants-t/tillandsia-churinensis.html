                    <h1>Tillandsia churinensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia churinensis, commonly known as the Churin air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of Peru.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts.</p>
