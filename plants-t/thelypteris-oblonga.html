<p>Thelypteris oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Thelypteris oblonga produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
