<p>Thouinia tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly thyme or woolly mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic properties and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in herbal medicine.</p>
