                    <h1>Tassadia ivoniae</h1>
<p>Tassadia ivoniae, commonly known as the Ivory Flame Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the misty highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features elongated, gracefully curved petals that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, resembling flames against the green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically from June to August. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Tassadia ivoniae is considered endangered and is protected under several international conservation agreements.</p>
