                    <h1>Triticum sativum var. erinaceum</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum var. erinaceum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat characterized by its distinctive awned spikelets.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in marginal environments.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is studied for its potential in genetic research and as a source of beneficial traits for modern wheat varieties.</p>
