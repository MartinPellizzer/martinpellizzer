                    <h1>Tulotis</h1>
<p>Tulotis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Tulotis species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Their roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud, while the leaves provide a surface for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The flowers of Tulotis play an important role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
