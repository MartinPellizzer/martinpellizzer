<p>Thelypteris minor, commonly known as the lesser shield fern, is a small to medium-sized fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a slender, upright rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped fronds. Its fronds are usually 15â€“30 cm long, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Thelypteris minor produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
