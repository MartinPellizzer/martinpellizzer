                    <h1>Trillium erectum f. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Trillium erectum f. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered white trillium, is a rare and diminutive variant of the red trillium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white petals and reduced floral structure compared to the typical species. The plant features three broadly ovate leaves and a short, erect stem. It blooms in early spring, producing a single, delicate flower with three sepals and three petals.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique morphology.</p>
