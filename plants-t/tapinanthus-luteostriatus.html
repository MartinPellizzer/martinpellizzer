                    <h1>Tapinanthus luteostriatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus luteostriatus, commonly known as the golden-striped dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on other plants in open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
