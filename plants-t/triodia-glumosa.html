<p>Triodia glumosa, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Triodia glumosa is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
