                    <h1>Tamarix salina</h1>
<p>Tamarix salina, commonly known as salt cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline and coastal environments. Its roots can absorb and store salt, which helps it thrive in areas where other plants struggle.</p>
<p>Tamarix salina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils in challenging conditions.</p>
