The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its botanical features include narrow leaf blades and a short, rhizomatous stem, which aid in its survival in marginal environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
