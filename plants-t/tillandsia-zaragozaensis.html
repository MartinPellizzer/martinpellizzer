                    <h1>Tillandsia zaragozaensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zaragozaensis, commonly known as the Zaragoza airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to survive in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
