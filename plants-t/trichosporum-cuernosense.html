                    <h1>Trichosporum cuernosense</h1>
<p>Trichosporum cuernosense, commonly known as the horned trichosporum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that resembles horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Trichosporum cuernosense is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered an important component of its alpine ecosystem.</p>
