<p>Trisetum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or damp environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in three rows, a characteristic feature of many sedges.</p>
<p>Trisetum pauciflorum produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, contributing to its classification as a monocot.</p>
