                    <h1>Tofieldia calyculata proles glacialis</h1>
<p>Tofieldia calyculata proles glacialis, commonly known as the glacial tofieldia, is a rare plant species native to high-altitude environments in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like structure and specialized adaptations to cold climates. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
