                    <h1>Toxostigma purpurascens</h1>
<p>Toxostigma purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Toxostigma purpurascens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
