                    <h1>Trapa brevicarpa var. mirabila</h1>
<p>Trapa brevicarpa var. mirabila, commonly known as the golden water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that disperse seeds by attaching to the fur of animals or humans. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
