                    <h1>Thymus jankae</h1>
<p>Thymus jankae, commonly known as Janka's thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, pink or purple flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thymus jankae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
