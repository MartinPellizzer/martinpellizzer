<p>Tecticornia indica subsp.</p>
<p>julacea, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
