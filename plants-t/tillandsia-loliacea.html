<p>Tillandsia loliacea, commonly known as the silver vulture, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are covered in fine trichomes that help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>Tillandsia loliacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
