                    <h1>Toxicodendrum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendrum, commonly known as poison ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes contact dermatitis in many people. Toxicodendrum species are native to the Americas and are often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>They are considered invasive in some regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
