                    <h1>Triticum inflatum</h1>
<p>Triticum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive seed heads that appear inflated and bulbous, which is an adaptation for wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and historical significance, Triticum inflatum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
