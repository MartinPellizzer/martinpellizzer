                    <h1>Tapinanthus brachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus brachyphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that relies on host trees for its survival.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the host's vascular system. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on the branches of trees such as acacia and eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential ecological concern in some areas.</p>
