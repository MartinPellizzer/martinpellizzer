<p>Tillandsia sericea, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sericea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
