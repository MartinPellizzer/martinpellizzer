<p>Thelocactus nidulans subsp.</p>
<p>matudae, commonly known as the Matudas' thorned cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
