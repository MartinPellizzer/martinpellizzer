                    <h1>Toxicodendrum cobbe</h1>
<p>Toxicodendrum cobbe, commonly known as the cobbe's poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically opposite and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
