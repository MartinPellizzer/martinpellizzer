                    <h1>Tragacantha pubentissima</h1>
<p>Tragacantha pubentissima, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum from its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves helps reduce water loss, making it adapted to arid environments.</p>
