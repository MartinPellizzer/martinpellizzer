<p>Tetraena propinqua subsp.</p>
<p>migahidii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is often covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing desert landscapes.</p>
