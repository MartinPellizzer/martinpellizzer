                    <h1>Tolpis succulenta var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Tolpis succulenta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles that bear pale yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in hot, dry environments. Its stems are fleshy and store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often mistaken for other cholla species due to its similar appearance and branching structure.</p>
