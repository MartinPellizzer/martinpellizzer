                    <h1>Thelypteris tephrophylla</h1>
<p>Thelypteris tephrophylla, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are covered in small, specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris tephrophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
