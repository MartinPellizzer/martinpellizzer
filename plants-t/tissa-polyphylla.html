<p>Tissa polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tissa polyphylla is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its essential oils are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial properties.</p>
