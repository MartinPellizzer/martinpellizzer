                    <h1>Telipogon felinus</h1>
<p>Telipogon felinus, commonly known as the cat's tail orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a cat's tail, consisting of a dense cluster of small, white or pale violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon felinus is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
