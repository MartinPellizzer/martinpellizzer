                    <h1>Triticum durum var. sphaeroleucurum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. sphaeroleucurum, commonly known as the white wheat, is a botanical variety characterized by its unique pale coloration and compact grain structure.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for durum wheat products such as pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, elongated leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a significant amount of sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct botanical features, it is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
