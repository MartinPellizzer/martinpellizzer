                    <h1>Thrixspermum raciborskii var. hamatum</h1>
<p>Thrixspermum raciborskii var. hamatum, commonly known as the golden alga, is a unicellular cyanobacterium that forms colonies.</p>
<p>It is notable for its ability to produce toxic compounds, including saxitoxin, which can be harmful to aquatic life and humans. This species thrives in nutrient-rich freshwater environments, often in lakes and reservoirs. Its rapid growth can lead to harmful algal blooms, impacting water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology includes long, filamentous cells that can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
