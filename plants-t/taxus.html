                    <h1>Taxus</h1>
<p>Taxus, commonly known as yew, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees and shrubs that includes several species, many of which are found in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their scale-like leaves and produce small, red, fleshy arils around their seeds. The bark of Taxus species is typically reddish-brown and has a distinctive, flaky texture. Taxus plants are known for their toxicity, particularly due to the presence of taxanes, which are compounds used in cancer chemotherapy.</p>
<p>They also have a long history of use in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants.</p>
