                    <h1>Tylloma glabratum var. eurylepis</h1>
<p>Tylloma glabratum var. eurylepis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are densely packed to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and succulent leaves that store water.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
