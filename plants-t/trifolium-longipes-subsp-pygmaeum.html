<p>Trifolium longipes subsp.</p>
<p>pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
