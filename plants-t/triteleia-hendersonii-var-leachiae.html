<p>Triteleia hendersonii var. leachiae, commonly known as the Leach's glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial native to the coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It produces showy, white to pale blue flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal bluffs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
