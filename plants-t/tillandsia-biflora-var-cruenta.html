<p>Tillandsia biflora var. cruenta, commonly known as the Crimson Air Plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
