                    <h1>Tovaria yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Tovaria yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tovaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within temperate forests, often at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tovaria yunnanensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
