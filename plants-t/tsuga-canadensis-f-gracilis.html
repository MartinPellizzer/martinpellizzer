                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hemlock, is a rare variant of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like foliage and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical eastern hemlock. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its botanical features include elongated cones and a slower growth rate, making it a unique addition to botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
