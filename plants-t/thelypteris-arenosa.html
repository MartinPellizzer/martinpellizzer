                    <h1>Thelypteris arenosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris arenosa, commonly known as the sand fern, is a species of fern native to sandy soils in coastal regions of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, mat-like structure. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile fronds being shorter and more compact compared to the longer, fertile fronds that bear spores. Its rhizomes are wiry and extensively branched, allowing it to spread and colonize sandy environments effectively.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and poor soil nutrients.</p>
