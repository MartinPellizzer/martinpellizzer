<p>Tieghemopanax, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its trunk is typically short and stout, with a smooth, dark green bark.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and rarity in the wild, Tieghemopanax is considered a valuable and endangered species in botanical collections.</p>
