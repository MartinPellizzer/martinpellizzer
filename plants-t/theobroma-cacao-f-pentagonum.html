                    <h1>Theobroma cacao f. pentagonum</h1>
<p>Theobroma cacao f. pentagonum, commonly known as the pentagonum cacao, is a botanical variant of the cacao tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pentagonal shape of the cacao pods, which distinguishes it from the more common round pods of other cacao varieties. The plant produces seeds used in the production of chocolate, though it is less commercially cultivated than the standard cacao varieties. Its botanical features make it of interest to researchers and horticulturists studying cacao genetics and diversity.</p>
<p>The pentagonum form is also valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving cacao resilience and yield.</p>
