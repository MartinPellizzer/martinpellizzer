                    <h1>Trichomanes petraeum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes petraeum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a small, evergreen fern native to rocky and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It has delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a compact, low-growing plant. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its often arid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
