                    <h1>Tillandsia paraensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia paraensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and indirect light to thrive.</p>
