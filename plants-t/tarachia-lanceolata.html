<p>Tarachia lanceolata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, desert environments with minimal water availability.</p>
