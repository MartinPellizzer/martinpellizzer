                    <h1>Thelypteris rupestris</h1>
<p>Thelypteris rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rupestris is often found in moist, humid environments, contributing to the biodiversity of forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
