                    <h1>Triticum × hebestachyum</h1>
<p>Triticum × hebestachyum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Triticum aestivum.</p>
<p>It is a tetraploid grass that naturally occurs in the Fertile Crescent region, characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant typically produces spikelets with two to three rows of bristle-like awns, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is known for its genetic diversity, which makes it an important resource for wheat breeding programs.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant role in the study of wheat evolution and has contributed to the development of modern cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
