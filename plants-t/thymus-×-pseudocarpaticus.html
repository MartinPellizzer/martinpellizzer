                    <h1>Thymus × pseudocarpaticus</h1>
<p>Thymus × pseudocarpaticus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant, gray-green leaves and produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic essential oils, which are responsible for its distinctive thyme scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Thymus serpyllum and Thymus pulegioides, contributing to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
