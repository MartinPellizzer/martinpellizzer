                    <h1>Tapinanthus pseudonymus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus pseudonymus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees, and is found in regions with warm, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host.</p>
