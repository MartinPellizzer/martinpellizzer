                    <h1>Thismia okhaensis</h1>
<p>Thismia okhaensis, commonly known as the Okha ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the dense forests of northeastern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, a group of plants known for their unique and often striking floral structures. The plant is characterized by its small, white, orchid-like flowers that lack petals and sepals, instead featuring a single, elongated labellum. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thismia okhaensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
