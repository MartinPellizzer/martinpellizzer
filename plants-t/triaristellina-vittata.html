<p>Triaristellina vittata, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are often arranged in two rows and are covered with small, translucent structures called oil bodies. Triaristellina vittata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This liverwort is an important indicator species for assessing the health of humid, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
