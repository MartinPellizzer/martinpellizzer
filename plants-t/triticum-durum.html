                    <h1>Triticum durum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat that is botanically characterized by its hard, amber-colored grains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and parallel-veined, and the flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes.</p>
<p>Durum wheat is particularly noted for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous.</p>
