<p>Tillandsia appuniana, commonly known as the Appunian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts.</p>
