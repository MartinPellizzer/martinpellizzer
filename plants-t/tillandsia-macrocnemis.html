                    <h1>Tillandsia macrocnemis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia macrocnemis, commonly known as the large-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
