                    <h1>Toxicodendron radicans var. verrucosum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans var. verrucosum, commonly known as the Southern pokeweed, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often clustered growth pattern.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, disturbed soils, such as those found in woodland edges and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and can grow as a shrub or vine, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Like other members of the Toxicodendron genus, it contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
