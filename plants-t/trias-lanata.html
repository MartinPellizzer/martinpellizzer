                    <h1>Trias lanata</h1>
<p>Trias lanata, commonly known as the woolly trias, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, lanolin-like covering on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This waxy coating, known as lanata, serves as a natural defense mechanism against desiccation and herbivory. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a silvery or grayish hue due to the thick cuticle.</p>
<p>Trias lanata is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
