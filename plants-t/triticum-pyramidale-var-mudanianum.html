                    <h1>Triticum pyramidale var. mudanianum</h1>
<p>Triticum pyramidale var. mudanianum, commonly known as the Mudanian wheat, is a lesser-known variant of the wheat species Triticum pyramidale.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with a cluster of short, awned glumes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to cooler climates, often found in grasslands or disturbed soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with parallel venation and a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to certain environmental conditions.</p>
