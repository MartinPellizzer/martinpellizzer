                    <h1>Tzellemtinia</h1>
<p>Tzellemtinia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, and it often thrives in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Tzellemtinia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
