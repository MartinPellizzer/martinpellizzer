<p>Taraxacum spathulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow-orange flower head that develops into a crown of white parachute-like seeds. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are generally shorter and broader than those of other dandelion species, and it produces a single flower head per stem.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
