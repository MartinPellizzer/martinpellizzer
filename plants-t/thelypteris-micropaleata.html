<p>Thelypteris micropaleata, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris micropaleata thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
