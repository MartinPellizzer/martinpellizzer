<p>Trifolium messanense, commonly known as the Messina clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
