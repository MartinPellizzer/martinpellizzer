<p>Ticoglossum krameri f. album, commonly known as the white form of the common twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. This epiphytic plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, relying on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
