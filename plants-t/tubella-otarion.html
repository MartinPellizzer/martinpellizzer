<p>Tubella otarion, commonly known as the sea anemone-like sponge, is a marine sponge belonging to the family Halichondriidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, porous body and a unique structure of tube-like cells called choanocytes. This sponge is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is covered in a delicate network of pores that facilitate water flow for filter feeding.</p>
<p>The coloration of Tubella otarion can vary, often appearing in shades of pink, purple, or orange, depending on its environment.</p>
