                    <h1>Taxillus sordidus</h1>
<p>Taxillus sordidus, commonly known as the smoky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant's small, inconspicuous flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds. Taxillus sordidus plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and sustenance for wildlife, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
<p>Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, making it a subject of both ecological interest and concern.</p>
