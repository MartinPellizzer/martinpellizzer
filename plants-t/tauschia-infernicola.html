                    <h1>Tauschia infernicola</h1>
<p>Tauschia infernicola, commonly known as the infernal tauschia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that resemble fire. The plant is adapted to extreme heat and drought, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tauschia infernicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
