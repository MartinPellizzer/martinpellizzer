                    <h1>Trixis decurrens</h1>
<p>Trixis decurrens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trixis decurrens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
