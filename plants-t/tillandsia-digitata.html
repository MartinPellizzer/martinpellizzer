                    <h1>Tillandsia digitata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia digitata, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and other structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of thread-like leaves. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it often grows in humid, shaded environments. Its appearance resembles a soft, green carpet, and it plays a role in providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Despite its name, Spanish moss is not a parasite but rather a symbiotic plant that does not harm its host.</p>
