                    <h1>Tetradenia barberae</h1>
<p>Tetradenia barberae, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
