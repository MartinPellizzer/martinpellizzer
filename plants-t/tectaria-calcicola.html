                    <h1>Tectaria calcicola</h1>
<p>Tectaria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone tectaria, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to mineral-rich soils.</p>
