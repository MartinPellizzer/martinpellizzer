<p>Tectaria membranacea, commonly known as the membranous tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Tectaria membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
