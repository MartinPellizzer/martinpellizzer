<p>Thelymitra dedmaniarum, commonly known as Dedman's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact plant with a rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that form a dense, low-growing structure. The flower spike bears a single, strikingly colored flower with a prominent, hood-like labellum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as gravel plains and sandplains.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution.</p>
