                    <h1>Thryothamnus</h1>
<p>Thryothamnus, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Thryothamnus species are characterized by their succulent, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. They produce yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its adaptations such as water storage in its stems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
