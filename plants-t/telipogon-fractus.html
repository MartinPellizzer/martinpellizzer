<p>Telipogon fractus, commonly known as the broken frond fern, is a rare and delicate member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, often frayed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Telipogon fractus is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
