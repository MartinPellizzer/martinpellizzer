<p>Trichosanthes rosthornii var. scabrella, commonly known as the rough gourd, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, warty fruits that mature to a pale green or yellowish color. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a bitter taste when raw but can be used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
