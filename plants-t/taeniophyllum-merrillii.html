                    <h1>Taeniophyllum merrillii</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum merrillii, commonly known as the Malayan mossy orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and intricate, moss-like growth habit, which allows it to blend seamlessly with its surroundings. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
