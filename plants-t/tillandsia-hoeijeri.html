                    <h1>Tillandsia hoeijeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hoeijeri, commonly known as the Orange Ghost, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically orange or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>Tillandsia hoeijeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
