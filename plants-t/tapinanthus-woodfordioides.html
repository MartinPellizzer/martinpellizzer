                    <h1>Tapinanthus woodfordioides</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus woodfordioides, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's stems are often covered in fine, thread-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. It is native to parts of Africa and is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
