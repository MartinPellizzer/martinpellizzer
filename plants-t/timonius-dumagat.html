<p>Timonius dumagat, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive central stripe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Timonius dumagat is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
