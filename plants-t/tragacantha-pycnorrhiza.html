                    <h1>Tragacantha pycnorrhiza</h1>
<p>Tragacantha pycnorrhiza, commonly known as the Persian gum or wild tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its deep root system that enables it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Its dried sap, known as tragacanth, is used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
