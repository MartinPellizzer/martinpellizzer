                    <h1>Tilia × extera</h1>
<p>Tilia × extera, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf linden).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of its parent species. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Tilia × extera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to a variety of soil types and climates.</p>
