                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. pseudouncinatum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. pseudouncinatum, commonly known as a wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat with significant genetic diversity.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that often remain closed at maturity, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a range of soil conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, tough grains that are resistant to shattering.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers for its potential role in crop improvement and genetic research.</p>
