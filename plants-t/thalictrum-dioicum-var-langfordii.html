                    <h1>Thalictrum dioicum var. langfordii</h1>
<p>Thalictrum dioicum var. langfordii, commonly known as the Langford's meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering habits compared to the typical form of Thalictrum dioicum.</p>
