                <h1>Torresia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Torresia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
