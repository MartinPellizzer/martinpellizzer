                    <h1>Trihesperus</h1>
<p>Trihesperus, commonly known as the red clover weevil, is a small beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in regions where red clover (Trifolium pratense) grows abundantly. The larvae of Trihesperus feed on the leaves and stems of red clover plants, causing significant damage to the foliage. Adult beetles are often seen on the flowering heads of the plant, where they feed on nectar.</p>
<p>This pest is an important consideration in agricultural settings where red clover is cultivated for forage or seed production.</p>
