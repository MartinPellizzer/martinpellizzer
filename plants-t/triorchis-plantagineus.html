                    <h1>Triorchis plantagineus</h1>
<p>Triorchis plantagineus, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its lack of above-ground stems, with the flower emerging directly from the base of the leaves.</p>
