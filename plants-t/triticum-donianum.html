                    <h1>Triticum donianum</h1>
<p>Triticum donianum, commonly known as Don's wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its genome contains valuable genetic diversity that can be used in breeding programs to improve agricultural wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Triticum donianum is of interest to researchers due to its potential for enhancing disease resistance and stress tolerance in wheat crops.</p>
