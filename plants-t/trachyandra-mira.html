<p>Trachyandra mira, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of cycads. Trachyandra mira thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas.</p>
