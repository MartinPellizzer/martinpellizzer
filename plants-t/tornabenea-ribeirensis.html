<p>Tornabenea ribeirensis, commonly known as the Ribeir√£o fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant to the substrate and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Tornabenea ribeirensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its aquatic habitat.</p>
