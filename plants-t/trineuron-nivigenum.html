<p>Trineuron nivigenum, commonly known as the frostbloom lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals that resemble snowflakes, hence its common name. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery绒毛. It blooms in late winter, producing clusters of delicate flowers that are pollinated primarily by cold-adapted bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to climate change, Trineuron nivigenum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
