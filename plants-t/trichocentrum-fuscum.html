<p>Trichocentrum fuscum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum fuscum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
