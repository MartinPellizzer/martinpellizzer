                    <h1>Triticum distachyon</h1>
<p>Triticum distachyon, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a grass species native to the Old World.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in temperate climates, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its small, hard grains are used for food, animal feed, and even as a source of biofuel.</p>
<p>Triticum distachyon is also a model organism in plant genetics due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity.</p>
