<p>Thelocactus rinconensis subsp.</p>
<p>nidulans, commonly known as the Rinc√≥n cactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic traits compared to other Thelocactus species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
