                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. subtadjicorum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. subtadjicorum, commonly known as the subtropical wheat, is a variant of common wheat adapted to warmer climates.</p>
<p>It exhibits shorter stature and earlier maturity compared to standard wheat varieties, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical regions. The plant has a robust root system that helps it withstand drought conditions. Its grain is typically smaller and has a higher protein content than conventional wheat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest for agricultural research due to its potential in climate-resilient farming.</p>
