                    <h1>Tinus pachysandra</h1>
<p>Tinus pachysandra, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with small, rounded leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly tolerant of various soil types.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural areas.</p>
