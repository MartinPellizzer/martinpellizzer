<p>Tripogon wightii var. kanyakumariensis, commonly known as the Kanyakumari tripogon, is a rare and endemic grass species found exclusively in the southern tip of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy coastal soils and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
