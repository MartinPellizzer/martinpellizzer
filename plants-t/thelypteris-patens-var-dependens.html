                    <h1>Thelypteris patens var. dependens</h1>
<p>Thelypteris patens var. dependens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a slender and often arching appearance. The sori, which contain the spores, are arranged in lines on the underside of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
