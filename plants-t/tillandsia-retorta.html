                    <h1>Tillandsia retorta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia retorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, Tillandsia retorta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
