                    <h1>Tillandsia thyrsigera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia thyrsigera, commonly known as the pineapple air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with red or orange flowers, and it can bloom multiple times throughout its lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
