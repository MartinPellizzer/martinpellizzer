<p>Taraxacum sparsidens, commonly known as the sparseleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers develop into spherical, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Taraxacum sparsidens is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
