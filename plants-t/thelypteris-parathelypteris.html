<p>Thelypteris parathelypteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris parathelypteris is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its intricate frond structure and reproductive features make it an important species in the study of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
