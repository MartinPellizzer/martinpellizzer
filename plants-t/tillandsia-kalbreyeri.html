                    <h1>Tillandsia kalbreyeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered inflorescences with violet or pink flowers, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
