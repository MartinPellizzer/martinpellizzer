                    <h1>Taxillus thibetensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus thibetensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Taxillus thibetensis is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
