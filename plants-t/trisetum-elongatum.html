<p>Trisetum elongatum, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, grass-like foliage that often forms a mat or clump. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum elongatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
