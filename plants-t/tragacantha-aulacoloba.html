                    <h1>Tragacantha aulacoloba</h1>
<p>Tragacantha aulacoloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic gum resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha aulacoloba thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates.</p>
