<p>campestre, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters.</p>

<p>Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and potential use in forage and conservation agriculture.</p>
