<p>Tardavel podocephala, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas where it is non-native.</p>
