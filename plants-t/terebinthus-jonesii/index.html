                            <h1>Terebinthus Jonesii</h1>
<p>Jones' terebinth, scientifically known as Terebinthus jonesii, is a rare and ancient species native to the Middle East and parts of Turkey. This unique plant belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and distinctive, fragrant resin that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and rituals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Terebinthus jonesii is now critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its historical and ecological significance underscores the need for greater awareness and protection of this remarkable species.</p>
