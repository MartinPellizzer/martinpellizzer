                    <h1>Tingulonga almacega</h1>
<p>Tingulonga almacega, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Its sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
