<p>Taraxacum fulgidum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or yellow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a bright yellow flower head that consists of numerous ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which allows for effective seed distribution. It is native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum fulgidum is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
