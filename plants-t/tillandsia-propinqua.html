                    <h1>Tillandsia propinqua</h1>
<p>Tillandsia propinqua, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's small size and ability to absorb moisture through its leaves make it well adapted to its natural habitat. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
