<p>Tapinanthus kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
