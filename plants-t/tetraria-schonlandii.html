                    <h1>Tetraria schonlandii</h1>
<p>Tetraria schonlandii, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and green algae.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rock surfaces or soil in deserts. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
