<p>Tithymalus maritimus, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in salty, well-drained soils along shorelines. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Tithymalus maritimus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
