<p>Typha media, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spike that transitions from brown to yellow as it matures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Typha media plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and reduce erosion.</p>
