<p>Tephrocactus leoncito, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of yellow to orange spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior.
