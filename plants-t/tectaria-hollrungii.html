                    <h1>Tectaria hollrungii</h1>
<p>Tectaria hollrungii, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
