                    <h1>Tillaea purpurata</h1>
<p>Tillaea purpurata, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Tillaea purpurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
