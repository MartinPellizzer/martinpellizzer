                    <h1>Tillandsia gymnophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gymnophylla, commonly known as the gymnophylla airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Tillandsia gymnophylla is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
