<p>Trifolium kingii var. macilentum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a pale green to bluish-green color. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range.</p>
