                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. schimperi</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. schimperi, commonly known as Ethiopian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat with ancient origins in the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant produces small, tough grains that are encased in a tough hull, which must be removed before consumption. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow leaves, typical of many wild grasses.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in traditional and heirloom baking practices.</p>
