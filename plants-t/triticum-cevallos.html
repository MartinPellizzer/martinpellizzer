<p>Triticum cevallos, commonly known as wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically has narrow, blade-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are small and can be difficult to distinguish from other wheat species without close examination.</p>
<p>Triticum cevallos is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions.</p>
