                    <h1>Trichomanes aethiopicum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes aethiopicum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
