<p>Thelypteris frigida, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris frigida plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
