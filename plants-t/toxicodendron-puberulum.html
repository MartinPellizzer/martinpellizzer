<p>Toxicodendron puberulum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans.</p>
