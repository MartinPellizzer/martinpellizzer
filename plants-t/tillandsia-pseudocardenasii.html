                    <h1>Tillandsia pseudocardenasii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pseudocardenasii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
