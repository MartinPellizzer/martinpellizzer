<p>Trisetum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very finely hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Trisetum glabratum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
