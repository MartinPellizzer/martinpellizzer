                    <h1>Timonius ophioliticus</h1>
<p>Timonius ophioliticus, commonly known as the oceanic shield plant, is a rare species found in specific ophiolitic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils derived from ultramafic rock formations. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, waxy leaves adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of pale blue or white.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered an indicator species for ophiolitic ecosystems.</p>
