<p>Trifolium vesiculosum subsp.</p>
<p>setiferum, commonly known as the sticky vetchling, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive sticky texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
