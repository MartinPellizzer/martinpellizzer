                    <h1>Tapinanthus glomeratus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches itself to other plants using specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is native to southern Africa and is often found growing on grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
