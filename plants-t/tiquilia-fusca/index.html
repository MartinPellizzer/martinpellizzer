                            <h1>Tiquilia Fusca</h1>
<p>Fusca tiquilia, scientifically known as Tiquilia fusca, is a small, flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Despite its modest size, Tiquilia fusca plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and enhancing biodiversity in its native habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
