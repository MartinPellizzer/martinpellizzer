                    <h1>Thelypteris peripaeoides</h1>
<p>Thelypteris peripaeoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright stems, which bear the fertile fronds at their tips.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
