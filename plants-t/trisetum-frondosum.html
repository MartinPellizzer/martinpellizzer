<p>Trisetum frondosum, commonly known as the fronded wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-angled spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Trisetum frondosum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
