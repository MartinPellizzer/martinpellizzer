                    <h1>Tragopogon glaber</h1>
<p>Tragopogon glaber, commonly known as the common goatherb, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive central tuft of bristles, which are followed by slender, hairless seed stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Tragopogon glaber is known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, often sterile hybrids.</p>
