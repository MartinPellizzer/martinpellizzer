<p>Tillandsia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its foliage rather than through its roots. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
