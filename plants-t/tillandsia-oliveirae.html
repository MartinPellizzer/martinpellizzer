                    <h1>Tillandsia oliveirae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia oliveirae, commonly known as the Oliveira's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia oliveirae is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
