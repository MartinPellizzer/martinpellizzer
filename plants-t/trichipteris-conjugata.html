<p>Trichipteris conjugata, commonly known as the twin-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two pairs of opposite pinnae, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Trichipteris conjugata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
