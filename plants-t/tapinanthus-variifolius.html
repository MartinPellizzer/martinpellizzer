                    <h1>Tapinanthus variifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus variifolius, commonly known as the variable dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on various species of shrubs and trees. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
