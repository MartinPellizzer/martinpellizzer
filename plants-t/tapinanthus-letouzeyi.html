                    <h1>Tapinanthus letouzeyi</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus letouzeyi, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant in the family Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant typically grows as a vine, attaching itself to various host species such as shrubs or trees. Its flowers are small and usually purple or yellow, and it produces berries that contain toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a useful indicator of certain ecosystems and a potential threat to native flora.</p>
