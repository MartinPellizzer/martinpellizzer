                    <h1>Trifolium repens var. carneum</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens var. carneum, commonly known as the pink clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish flower heads.</p>
<p>This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>The varietal form carneum is notable for its unique floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical white clover.</p>
