                    <h1>Trifolium hygrophilum</h1>
<p>Trifolium hygrophilum, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of legume native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, streambanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Trifolium hygrophilum plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life.</p>
