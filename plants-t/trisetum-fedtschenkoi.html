<p>Trisetum fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's wood rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere, particularly in regions with high altitudes and moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and subarctic environments, where it contributes to the vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an indicator species for harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
