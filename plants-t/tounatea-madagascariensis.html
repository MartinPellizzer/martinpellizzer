<p>Tounatea madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan starfish plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
