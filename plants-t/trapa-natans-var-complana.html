                    <h1>Trapa natans var. complana</h1>
<p>Trapa natans var. complana, commonly known as the broadleaf water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive spiny fruits that contain single seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
