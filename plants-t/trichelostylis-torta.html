<p>Trichelostylis torta, commonly known as the twisted-styled fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that often display a twisted or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and often covered with a layer of fine roots, which help anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
