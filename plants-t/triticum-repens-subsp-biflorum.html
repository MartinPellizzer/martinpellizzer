<p>Triticum repens subsp.</p>
<p>biflorum, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two florets, a feature that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a forage plant and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
