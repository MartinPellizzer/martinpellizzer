<p>Tamonea scabra var. minor, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, sand-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
