<p>Telmatophace polyrhiza, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Telmatophace polyrhiza plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
