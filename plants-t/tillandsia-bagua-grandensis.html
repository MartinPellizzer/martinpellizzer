                    <h1>Tillandsia bagua-grandensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bagua-grandensis, commonly known as the eight-angled air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
