                    <h1>Tafalla maxima</h1>
<p>Tafalla maxima, commonly known as the giant tafalla, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which are adapted to capture sunlight in its cool, mountainous environment. The plant produces vibrant purple and pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tafalla maxima is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
