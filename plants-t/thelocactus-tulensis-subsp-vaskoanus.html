<p>Thelocactus tulensis subsp.</p>
<p>vaskoanus, commonly known as the Vasko's tulip cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is often adorned with a single, large, showy flower that resembles a tulip, typically in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>The plant has a dense covering of white or light-colored spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
