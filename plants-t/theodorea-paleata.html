                    <h1>Theodorea paleata</h1>
<p>Theodorea paleata, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of Georgia in the United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a unique root system adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Theodorea paleata is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
