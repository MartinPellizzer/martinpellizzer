                    <h1>Tillandsia × floridana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × floridana, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a hybrid orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces inflorescences with striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
