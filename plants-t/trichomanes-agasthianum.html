                    <h1>Trichomanes agasthianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes agasthianum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes agasthianum is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
