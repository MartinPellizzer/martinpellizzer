                    <h1>Tetrapollinia</h1>
<p>Tetrapollinia, commonly known as the "four-pollen plant," is a rare and specialized genus within the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive structure, where each flower produces four pollen sacs, a feature that sets it apart from most other orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Tetrapollinia is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
