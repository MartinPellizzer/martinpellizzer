                    <h1>Tapinanthus kilimandscharicus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus kilimandscharicus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the Rubiaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
