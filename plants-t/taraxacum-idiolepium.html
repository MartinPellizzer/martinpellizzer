                    <h1>Taraxacum idiolepium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum idiolepium, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions.</p>
