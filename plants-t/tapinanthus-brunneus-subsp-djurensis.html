<p>Tapinanthus brunneus subsp.</p>
<p>djurensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood parasite, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the grasslands of southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of grasses or shrubs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy coating.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
