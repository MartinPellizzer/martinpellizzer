                    <h1>Triglochin racemosa</h1>
<p>Triglochin racemosa, commonly known as sea arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates brackish water conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Triglochin racemosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
