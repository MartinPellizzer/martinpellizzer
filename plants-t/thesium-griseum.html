                    <h1>Thesium griseum</h1>
<p>Thesium griseum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, fleshy, leafless stem that bears a single, pale green or white flower. The plant is adapted to grow in swampy or waterlogged soils, often in association with specific fungal partners that aid in nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by its strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Thesium griseum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
