<p>Thunbergia repens, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a trailing perennial vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Thunbergia repens is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and hanging baskets due to its ornamental flowers and easy care requirements.</p>
