                    <h1>Tillandsia tephrophylla var. guzmanioides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tephrophylla var. guzmanioides, commonly known as the Guzmann's airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking violet to purple inflorescences, which are often taller than the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
