                    <h1>Thesium sonderianum</h1>
<p>Thesium sonderianum, commonly known as the desert candle or yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, candle-like stem that is often covered in a layer of fine, white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a similar waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Thesium sonderianum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
