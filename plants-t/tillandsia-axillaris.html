                    <h1>Tillandsia axillaris</h1>
<p>Tillandsia axillaris, commonly known as the axillary tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals from the air. Its inflorescence features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
