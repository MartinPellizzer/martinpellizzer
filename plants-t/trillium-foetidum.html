<p>Trillium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking Benjamin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three large, heart-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant's distinctive feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract carrion flies for pollination. Trillium foetidum thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and declining populations, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>
