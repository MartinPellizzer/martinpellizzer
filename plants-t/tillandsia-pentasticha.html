                    <h1>Tillandsia pentasticha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pentasticha, commonly known as the star-shaped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, star-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central and South America and is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
