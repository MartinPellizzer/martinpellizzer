                    <h1>Tubella franciscantha</h1>
<p>Tubella franciscantha, commonly known as the lacecap mushroom, is a species of basidiomycete fungus characterized by its intricate, lace-like cap.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is typically found in temperate forest ecosystems. The fruiting bodies are small, with a pale to reddish-brown cap that becomes more pronounced with age. The gills are closely spaced and often decurrent, extending down the stipe.</p>
<p>This mushroom is saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in the soil and playing a vital role in nutrient cycling.</p>
