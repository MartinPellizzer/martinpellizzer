                    <h1>Turrita</h1>
<p>Turrita, commonly known as the Turritella, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Turritellidae.</p>
<p>These snails are characterized by their tall, spiraled shells that are often ornamented with axial ribs and spirals. They are typically found in shallow marine environments, including tidal zones and rocky shores. The shells of Turritella species are often used as indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions due to their sensitivity to water temperature and salinity.</p>
<p>Their presence in fossil records provides valuable insights into ancient marine ecosystems.</p>
