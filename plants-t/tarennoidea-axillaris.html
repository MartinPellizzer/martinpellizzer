<p>Tarennoidea axillaris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Tarennoidea axillaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
