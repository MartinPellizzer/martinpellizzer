                    <h1>Tragacantha stenostegia</h1>
<p>Tragacantha stenostegia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
