<p>Taraxacum palustre subsp.</p>
<p>litophyllum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem topped with a composite yellow flower head. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain flora and a subject of interest in plant ecology.</p>
