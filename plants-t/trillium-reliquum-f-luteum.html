                    <h1>Trillium reliquum f. luteum</h1>
<p>Trillium reliquum f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three large, showy yellow petals and three sepals that are typically a lighter yellow or greenish-white. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers at the top. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, often growing in rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas.</p>
