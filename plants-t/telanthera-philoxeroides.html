                    <h1>Telanthera philoxeroides</h1>
<p>Telanthera philoxeroides, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain areas, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic.</p>
