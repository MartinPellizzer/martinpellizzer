                    <h1>Triticum nubigenum</h1>
<p>Triticum nubigenum, commonly known as cloud wheat, is a rare and enigmatic grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, fluffy seeds that resemble clouds, giving it its unique common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its genetic makeup is of particular interest to botanists due to its potential for adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
<p>However, it remains little studied and is considered a cryptic species with limited ecological data.</p>
