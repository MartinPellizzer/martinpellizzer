<p>Tilia americana subf.</p>
<p>euryptera, commonly known as the American linden or large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the common linden.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
