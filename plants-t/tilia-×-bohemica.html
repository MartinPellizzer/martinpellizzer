<p>Tilia × bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian lime, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to Central Europe, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The Bohemian lime is also valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
