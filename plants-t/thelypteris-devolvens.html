<p>Thelypteris devolvens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15â€“30 cm, with its rhizomes spreading horizontally through the soil.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds for propagation.</p>
