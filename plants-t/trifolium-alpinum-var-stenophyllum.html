                    <h1>Trifolium alpinum var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Trifolium alpinum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of other clover species. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or grassy alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments.</p>
