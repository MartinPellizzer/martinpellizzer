<p>Thymus talijevii subsp.</p>
<p>paucifolius, commonly known as the rare Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, typical of many thyme species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
