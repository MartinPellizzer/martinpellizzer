                    <h1>Teucrium stoloniferum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Teucrium stoloniferum var. typicum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, blooming in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
