                    <h1>Tapinanthus subulatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus subulatus, commonly known as the forked leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental appearance make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
