                    <h1>Toxicodendron cuneatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron cuneatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided or treated with caution in natural environments.</p>
