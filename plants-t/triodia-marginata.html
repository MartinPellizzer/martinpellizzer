                    <h1>Triodia marginata</h1>
<p>Triodia marginata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Triodia marginata plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
