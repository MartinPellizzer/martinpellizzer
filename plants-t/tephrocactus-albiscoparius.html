                    <h1>Tephrocactus albiscoparius</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus albiscoparius, commonly known as the white-hair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus albiscoparius is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry, open habitats where it can receive ample sunlight.</p>
