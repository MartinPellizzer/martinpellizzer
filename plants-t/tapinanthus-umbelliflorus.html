                    <h1>Tapinanthus umbelliflorus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus umbelliflorus, commonly known as the parasitic starflower, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which makes it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, giving it its scientific name. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host.</p>
