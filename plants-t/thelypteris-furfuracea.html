<p>Thelypteris furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
