                    <h1>Tamarix hispida estivalis</h1>
<p>Tamarix hispida estivalis, commonly known as the summer tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in spikes, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in landscaping and for erosion control in dry areas.</p>
