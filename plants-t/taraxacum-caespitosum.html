<p>Taraxacum caespitosum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a "clock," which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum caespitosum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
