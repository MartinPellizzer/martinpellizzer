                    <h1>Triticum angustum</h1>
<p>Triticum angustum, commonly known as narrow wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and has limited agricultural use due to its low yield and hardiness.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is of interest for its genetic diversity and potential role in breeding programs for resilient wheat varieties.</p>
