                    <h1>Thismia sumatrana</h1>
<p>Thismia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran star orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble stars. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which provide essential nutrients in exchange for carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized biology and habitat requirements, this species is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
