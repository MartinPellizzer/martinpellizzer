                    <h1>Trixis divaricata f. subpetiolata</h1>
<p>Trixis divaricata f. subpetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trixis, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert environments.</p>
