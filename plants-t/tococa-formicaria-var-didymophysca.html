<p>Tococa formicaria var. didymophysca, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa bean, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. The seeds, which are the primary part used in traditional practices, are rich in alkaloids and have been used for centuries in ceremonial and medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
