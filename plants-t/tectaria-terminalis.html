<p>Tectaria terminalis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules.</p>
<p>Tectaria terminalis is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte in its native habitats.</p>
