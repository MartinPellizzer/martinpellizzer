<p>Thelypteris harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris harveyi thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
