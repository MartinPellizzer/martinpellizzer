<p>Trachyrhizum villosipes, commonly known as the hairy root orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy roots and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique root structure aids in nutrient absorption from poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
