                    <h1>Trichocereus</h1>
<p>Trichocereus, commonly known as the "Moon cactus" or "Peyote," is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their erect, spiny stems and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They belong to the Cactaceae family and are adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Some species, like Trichocereus peruvianus, are known for their psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
