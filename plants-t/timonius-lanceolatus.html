                    <h1>Timonius lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Timonius lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf timonius, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in water-saturated soils.</p>
<p>Timonius lanceolatus is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
