                    <h1>Typha latifolia</h1>
<p>Typha latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes and broad, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Typha latifolia is also valued for its historical use in making thatching and basketry.</p>
