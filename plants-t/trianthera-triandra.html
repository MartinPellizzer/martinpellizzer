<p>Trianthera triandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Trianthera triandra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
