<p>Trichomanes radicans var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican walking fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rocks. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates.</p>
