                    <h1>Trapa longicarpa f. perangusticornis</h1>
<p>Trapa longicarpa f. perangusticornis, commonly known as the narrow-beak water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Euryalaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow beak-like structure on its fruit, which distinguishes it from other Trapa species. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it thrives in muddy substrates. Its leaves are submerged, while the floating fruits remain near the water surface.</p>
<p>This botanical feature aids in seed dispersal by water currents, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
