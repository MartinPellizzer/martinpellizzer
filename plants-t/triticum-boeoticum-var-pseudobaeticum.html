                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. pseudobaeticum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. pseudobaeticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to domesticated wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in breeding programs for improved crop resilience.</p>
