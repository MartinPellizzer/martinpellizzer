                    <h1>Tillandsia × complachroma</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × complachroma, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a hybrid epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing nutrients and water through its leaf surfaces. It produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
