                    <h1>Trichophyllum tuberculosum</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum tuberculosum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rocky surfaces in arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and green algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in harsh, cold environments where few other plants can survive.</p>
<p>This lichen plays an important role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
