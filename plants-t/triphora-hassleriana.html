<p>Triphora hassleriana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. Its flowers are typically orange or red, with a unique, almost otherworldly appearance.</p>
<p>Triphora hassleriana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
