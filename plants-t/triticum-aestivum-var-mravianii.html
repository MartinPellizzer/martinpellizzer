                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. mravianii</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. mravianii, commonly known as the Mravina wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size that is smaller compared to the hexaploid common wheat. This variety is notable for its unique genetic makeup, which includes specific alleles that may confer resistance to certain diseases. The plant typically exhibits a slender stalk and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its botanical traits make it of interest for genetic research and breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
