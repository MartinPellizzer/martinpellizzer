                    <h1>Triticum repens var. major</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. major, commonly known as creeping wheat, is a grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground through stolons.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows or along waterways. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>While not a major crop, it plays a role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
