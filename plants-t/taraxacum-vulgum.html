<p>Taraxacum vulgum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy, white pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Taraxacum vulgum is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils.</p>
