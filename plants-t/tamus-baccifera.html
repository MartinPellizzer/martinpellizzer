<p>Tamus baccifera, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Tamus baccifera is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
