                    <h1>Triodia decumbens var. longiglumis</h1>
<p>Triodia decumbens var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume triodia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and produces dense, fibrous tussocks that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It is well adapted to drought and heat, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains, contributing to the ecological diversity of these ecosystems.</p>
