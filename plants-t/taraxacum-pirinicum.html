                    <h1>Taraxacum pirinicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pirinicum, commonly known as the Pirin dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower, which later develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum pirinicum is a member of the Asteraceae family and is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment.</p>
