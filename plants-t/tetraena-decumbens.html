<p>Tetraena decumbens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Tetraena decumbens is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
