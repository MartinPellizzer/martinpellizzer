                    <h1>Tapinanthus zeyheri</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus zeyheri, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in the genus Acacia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Tapinanthus zeyheri is native to southern Africa and is often found in woodland and thicket habitats.</p>
