                    <h1>Tillandsia camargoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia camargoensis, commonly known as the Camargo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and violet, adding a striking contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>Tillandsia camargoensis is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
