                    <h1>Tubiflora squamosa</h1>
<p>Tubiflora squamosa, commonly known as the scaly tuberous plant, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a waxy, scaly coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its tuberous roots store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tubiflora squamosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in certain regions.</p>
