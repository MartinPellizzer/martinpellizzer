<p>Trillium morii, commonly known as the Morii's trillium, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three large, heart-shaped leaves and a single, nodding white flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Trillium morii is a perennial herb that blooms in early spring, often before its leaves fully expand.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
