<p>Thelypteris cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris cretacea plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
