<p>Telipogon uribevelezii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its narrow habitat range and specialized ecological requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from extinction.</p>
