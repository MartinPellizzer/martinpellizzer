<p>Touchardia napaliensis, commonly known as the Napali touchardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
