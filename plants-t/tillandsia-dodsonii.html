<p>Tillandsia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a coloration that ranges from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia dodsonii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate light for optimal growth.</p>
