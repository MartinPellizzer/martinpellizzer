                    <h1>Triticum durum grex leucura</h1>
<p>Triticum durum grex leucura, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grain.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its use in pasta and semolina due to its high gluten content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, and the grains are enclosed in tough, protective hulls.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a significant amount of sunlight and water during its growth cycle.</p>
