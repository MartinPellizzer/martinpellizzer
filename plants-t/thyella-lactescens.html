                    <h1>Thyella lactescens</h1>
<p>Thyella lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed bladder, is a unique plant native to arid regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflated, bladder-like structures, which are adapted for seed dispersal by wind.</p>
