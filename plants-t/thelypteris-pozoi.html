<p>Thelypteris pozoi, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in clusters along the veins.</p>
<p>Thelypteris pozoi plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
