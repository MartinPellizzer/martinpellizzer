This fern-like plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds and intricate leaf structures. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is classified as critically endangered by conservation organizations. The plant plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, supporting various insect and microorganism populations. Efforts are ongoing to protect and study this species to ensure its survival for future generations.</p>
