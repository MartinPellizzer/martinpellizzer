                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata f. elongata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
