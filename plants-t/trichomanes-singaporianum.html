                    <h1>Trichomanes singaporianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes singaporianum, commonly known as the Singapore holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to Singapore.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive pattern of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
