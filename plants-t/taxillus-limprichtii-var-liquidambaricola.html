                    <h1>Taxillus limprichtii var. liquidambaricola</h1>
<p>Taxillus limprichtii var. liquidambaricola, commonly known as the mistletoe of the maple, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of maple trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense clusters on the host's branches.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions where its host trees are abundant.</p>
