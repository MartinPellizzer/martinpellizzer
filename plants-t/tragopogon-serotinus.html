                    <h1>Tragopogon serotinus</h1>
<p>Tragopogon serotinus, commonly known as late yellow flower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a distinctive, hollow, leafy stem. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces a tall, flowering stem with a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Tragopogon serotinus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the creation of new, often sterile, hybrid forms.</p>
