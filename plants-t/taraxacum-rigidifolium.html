                    <h1>Taraxacum rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigidleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and deeply lobed, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
