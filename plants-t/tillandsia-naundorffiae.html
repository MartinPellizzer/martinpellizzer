                    <h1>Tillandsia naundorffiae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia naundorffiae, commonly known as the Naundorf's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to survive in a variety of ecological niches, including tree canopies and rocky outcrops.</p>
