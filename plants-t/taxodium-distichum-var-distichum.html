                    <h1>Taxodium distichum var. distichum</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum var. distichum, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive flaky, reddish-brown bark and its ability to produce "knees," which are root protuberances that emerge from the water. The tree has needle-like leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall before dropping, and it produces cones that contain seeds. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and floodplains.</p>
<p>The bald cypress is valued for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its ornamental qualities.</p>
