<p>Trixis hexantha, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in sandy soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Trixis hexantha plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
