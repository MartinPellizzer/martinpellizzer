                    <h1>Tydaea × hillii</h1>
<p>Tydaea × hillii, commonly known as the hybrid reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Tydaea canadensis and Tydaea angustifolia, resulting in unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that contribute to wetland vegetation structure. Its culms are slender and erect, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
