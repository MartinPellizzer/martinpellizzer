                    <h1>Tillandsia longiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its most distinctive characteristic is its long, pendant inflorescence bearing small, white to pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia longiflora is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
