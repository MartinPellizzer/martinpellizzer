                    <h1>Trixis frutescens var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Trixis frutescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf trixis, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
