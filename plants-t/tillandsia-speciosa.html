                    <h1>Tillandsia speciosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia speciosa, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps in water retention. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish.</p>
