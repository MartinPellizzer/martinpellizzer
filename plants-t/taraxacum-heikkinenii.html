The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forest edges or open meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
