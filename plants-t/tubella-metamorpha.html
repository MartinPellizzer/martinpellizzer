                    <h1>Tubella metamorpha</h1>
<p>Tubella metamorpha, commonly known as the spiral sponge or spiral tubellarian, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of tube-like structures called ostia, which are used for water filtration. The body of Tubella metamorpha is typically elongated and cylindrical, with a soft, porous texture. It is found in shallow coastal waters and is often attached to substrates such as rocks or shells.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through filter feeding.</p>
