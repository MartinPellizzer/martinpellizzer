<p>Tillandsia duratii subsp.</p>
<p>streptocarpa, commonly known as the Streptocarpic Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers.</p>
<p>This species is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
