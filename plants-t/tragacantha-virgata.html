                    <h1>Tragacantha virgata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha virgata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha virgata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
