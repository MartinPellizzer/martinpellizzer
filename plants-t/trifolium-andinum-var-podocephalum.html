                    <h1>Trifolium andinum var. podocephalum</h1>
<p>Trifolium andinum var. podocephalum, commonly known as the Andean clover, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, purple or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat.</p>
