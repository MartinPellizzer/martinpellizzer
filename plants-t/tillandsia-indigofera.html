                    <h1>Tillandsia indigofera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia indigofera, commonly known as the Indigo Fern, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, making it an epiphytic plant.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
