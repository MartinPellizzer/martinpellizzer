                    <h1>Trichomanes foxworthyi</h1>
<p>Trichomanes foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes foxworthyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
