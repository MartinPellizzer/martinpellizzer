                    <h1>Thelymitra spiralis var. pallida</h1>
<p>Thelymitra spiralis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale spiraled rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Its flowers have a distinct spiral arrangement of petals and sepals, which is a defining feature of the Thelymitra genus.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form and is often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and light conditions.</p>
