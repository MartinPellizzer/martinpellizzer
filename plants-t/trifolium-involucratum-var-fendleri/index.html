                            <h1>Trifolium Involucratum Var. Fendleri</h1>
<p>Fendler's clover, scientifically known as Trifolium involucratum var. fendleri, is a rare and native flowering plant found primarily in the western United States. This variety of clover is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Fendler's clover is considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its dwindling populations.</p>
