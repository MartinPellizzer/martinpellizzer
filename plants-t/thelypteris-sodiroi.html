<p>Thelypteris sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
