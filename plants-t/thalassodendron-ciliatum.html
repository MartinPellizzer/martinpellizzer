<p>Thalassodendron ciliatum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, thriving in saline and sandy soils. The plant features showy, hibiscus-like flowers that are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Thalassodendron ciliatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
