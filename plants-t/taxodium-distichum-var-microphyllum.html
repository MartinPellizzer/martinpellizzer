                    <h1>Taxodium distichum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are closely packed along the branches. This variety is known for its ability to tolerate wet, swampy conditions, making it a common species in floodplain forests. The tree produces small, spherical cones and has a unique ability to produce "knees" â€” root projections that emerge from the water.</p>
<p>Its foliage turns a striking reddish-brown in the fall, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
