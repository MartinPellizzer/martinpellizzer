<p>Trichocereus huascha subsp.</p>
<p>robustus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and is often used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white, fine spines, which provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its psychoactive properties, particularly due to the presence of mescaline.</p>
