<p>Tium inyoense, commonly known as the Inyo tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. It is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental changes due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and endangered species from habitat loss and climate change impacts.</p>
