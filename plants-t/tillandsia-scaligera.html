                    <h1>Tillandsia scaligera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia scaligera, commonly known as the scalloped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered with a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia scaligera is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
