                    <h1>Thouinia striata var. portoricensis</h1>
<p>Thouinia striata var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
