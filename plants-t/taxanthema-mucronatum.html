                    <h1>Taxanthema mucronatum</h1>
<p>Taxanthema mucronatum, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of white to grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact, cushion-like structure. Taxanthema mucronatum is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, exhibiting resilience to cold, wind, and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
