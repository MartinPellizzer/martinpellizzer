                    <h1>Trichera midzorensis</h1>
<p>Trichera midzorensis, commonly known as the Zambian cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Zambia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichera midzorensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
