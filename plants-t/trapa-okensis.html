<p>Trapa okensis, commonly known as the Okinawan water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia, particularly found in the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure, with submerged leaves that are thread-like. The plant produces distinctive spiny fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by water. Trapa okensis thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for aquatic ecosystems and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
