                    <h1>Timonius avenis f. triflora</h1>
<p>Timonius avenis f. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered oatgrass, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the genus Timonius.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences that typically bear three flowers. The plant is native to specific regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a silver-gray hue that distinguishes it from other grass species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
