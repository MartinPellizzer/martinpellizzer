                    <h1>Tillandsia krahnii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia krahnii, commonly known as the Krahn's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia krahnii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
