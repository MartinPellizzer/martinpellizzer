                    <h1>Tapinanthus sansibarensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus sansibarensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, creeping stem that can spread over the host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be invasive and detrimental to the health of its host plants.</p>
