                    <h1>Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. pseudolongipes</h1>
<p>Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. pseudolongipes, commonly known as the Oʻahu false hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oʻahu.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
