                    <h1>Thecophyllum irazuense</h1>
<p>Thecophyllum irazuense, commonly known as the Iraz√∫ fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thecophyllum irazuense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
