                    <h1>Toxicodendron tenuinerve</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron tenuinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined poison ivy, is a woody shrub native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically alternate and have a distinct, narrow venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided or managed carefully in natural habitats.</p>
