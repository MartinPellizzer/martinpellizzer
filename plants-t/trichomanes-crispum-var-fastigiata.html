                    <h1>Trichomanes crispum var. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Trichomanes crispum var. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright holly fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, upright fronds that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The varietal form, fastigiata, is distinguished by its more compact and upright growth habit compared to the typical form.</p>
