                    <h1>Triticum salsuginosum</h1>
<p>Triticum salsuginosum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in soils with high salt content. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is adapted to absorb water from deep within the soil, making it drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Triticum salsuginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in saline habitats.</p>
