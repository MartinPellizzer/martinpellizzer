                    <h1>Tectaria fernandensis</h1>
<p>Tectaria fernandensis, commonly known as the São Tomé fern, is a species of fern native to the island of São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along a central rachis.</p>
<p>Tectaria fernandensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
