                    <h1>Tretorhiza</h1>
<p>Tretorhiza, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Tretorhiza species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they have adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. They possess a well-developed root system that helps them store water and nutrients, making them resilient to drought.</p>
<p>The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and beetles, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats.</p>
