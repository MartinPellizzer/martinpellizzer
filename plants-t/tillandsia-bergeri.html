                    <h1>Tillandsia bergeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bergeri, commonly known as the Berger's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
