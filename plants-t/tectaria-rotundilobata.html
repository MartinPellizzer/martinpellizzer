                <h1>Tectaria rotundilobata</h1>
<p>Tectaria rotundilobata, commonly known as the rounded-lobed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>Tectaria rotundilobata is often found in association with other epiphytic plants, thriving on tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of its habitat.</p>
