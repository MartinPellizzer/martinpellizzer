<p>Tragacantha coronilla, commonly known as crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a distinctive pod-like fruit that contains several seeds. It is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
