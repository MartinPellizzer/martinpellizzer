                    <h1>Thouinidium matudae</h1>
<p>Thouinidium matudae, commonly known as the Matudae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Thouinidium matudae is considered critically endangered.</p>
