<p>Thunbergia barbata, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Thunbergia barbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
