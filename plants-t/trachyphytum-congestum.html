                    <h1>Trachyphytum congestum</h1>
<p>Trachyphytum congestum, commonly known as the clustered roughleaf, is a unique species native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact growth habit, which help it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle aesthetic to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Trachyphytum congestum is well adapted to drought and heat, making it a resilient addition to xeriscaping efforts.</p>
