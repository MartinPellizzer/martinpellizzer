                    <h1>Taeniophyllum malianum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum malianum, commonly known as the Malian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has small, leathery leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both its host and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
