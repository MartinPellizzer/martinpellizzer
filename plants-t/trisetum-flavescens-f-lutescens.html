                    <h1>Trisetum flavescens f. lutescens</h1>
<p>Trisetum flavescens f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden tuft grass, is a variant of the slender false brome.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The leaves are typically bright yellow to golden in color, which distinguishes it from the more common green form of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its attractive color and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
