                    <h1>Tapinanthus remotus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus remotus, commonly known as the ghost flower or parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often going unnoticed due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
