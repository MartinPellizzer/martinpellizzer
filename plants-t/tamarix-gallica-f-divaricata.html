                    <h1>Tamarix gallica f. divaricata</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica f. divaricata, commonly known as the silver thorn, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in arid climates.</p>
