                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides var. robusta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides var. robusta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives by attaching itself to trees in humid environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, gray-green foliage. This variety is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters and ability to grow in a wide range of climates. It plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree.</p>
