<p>Thelypteris arrecta, commonly known as the upright water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically erect and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris arrecta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
