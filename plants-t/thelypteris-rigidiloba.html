                    <h1>Thelypteris rigidiloba</h1>
<p>Thelypteris rigidiloba, commonly known as the rigid frond fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rigid, upright growth habit. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rigidiloba is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
