                    <h1>Triticum caninum vaginans</h1>
<p>Triticum caninum vaginans, commonly known as the dog's wheat or goat's wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its seeds are encased in a thin, membranous husk, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of genetic diversity for wheat improvement.</p>
