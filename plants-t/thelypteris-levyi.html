<p>Thelypteris levyi, commonly known as the Levys' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Thelypteris levyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
