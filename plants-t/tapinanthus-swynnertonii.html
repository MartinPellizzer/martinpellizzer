                    <h1>Tapinanthus swynnertonii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus swynnertonii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, often attaching itself to the stems or roots of other species. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting insects for pollination. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic nature and striking appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
