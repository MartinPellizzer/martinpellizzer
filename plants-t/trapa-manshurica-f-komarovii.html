The plant typically grows in shallow waters, where its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and ecological studies.</p>
