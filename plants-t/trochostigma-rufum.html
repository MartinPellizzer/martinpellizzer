                    <h1>Trochostigma rufum</h1>
<p>Trochostigma rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and short-lived. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it a temporary and elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies.</p>
