                    <h1>Tillandsia adscendens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia adscendens, commonly known as the ascending air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
