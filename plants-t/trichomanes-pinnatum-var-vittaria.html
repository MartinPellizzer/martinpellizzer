<p>Trichomanes pinnatum var. vittaria, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle veining pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
