                    <h1>Tillandsia subimbricata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subimbricata, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its foliage is typically green with a velvety texture, and it can produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia subimbricata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions.</p>
