<p>Trigonochilum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, horn-like spurred petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring.</p>
<p>The orchid's root system is fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
