                    <h1>Tillandsia erecta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia erecta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It does not require soil for nourishment, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant features dense, hanging clusters of thread-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It is often found on trees in the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host.</p>
