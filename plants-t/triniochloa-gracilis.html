                    <h1>Triniochloa gracilis</h1>
<p>Triniochloa gracilis, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clumps that help stabilize the surrounding environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Triniochloa gracilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
