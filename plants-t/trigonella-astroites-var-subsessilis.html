                    <h1>Trigonella astroites var. subsessilis</h1>
<p>Trigonella astroites var. subsessilis, commonly known as the small-leaved fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, hairy pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other fenugreek species, particularly in its leaf and flower morphology.</p>
