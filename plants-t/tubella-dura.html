                    <h1>Tubella dura</h1>
<p>Tubella dura, commonly known as the hard tuber, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fleshy tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tubella dura is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties.</p>
