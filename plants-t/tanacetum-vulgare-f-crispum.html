                    <h1>Tanacetum vulgare f. crispum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum vulgare f. crispum, commonly known as curly leaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and allelopathic properties.</p>
