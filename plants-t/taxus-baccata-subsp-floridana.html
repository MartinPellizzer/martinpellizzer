<p>Taxus baccata subsp.</p>
<p>floridana, commonly known as the Florida yew, is a rare and relict subspecies of the yew tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-orange berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
