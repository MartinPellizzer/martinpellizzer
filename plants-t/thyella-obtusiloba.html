<p>Thyella obtusiloba, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like leaves that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are covered in a fine, woolly coating, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Thyella obtusiloba plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
