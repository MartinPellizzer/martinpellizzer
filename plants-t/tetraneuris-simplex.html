                    <h1>Tetraneuris simplex</h1>
<p>Tetraneuris simplex, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Tetraneuris simplex is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water availability.</p>
