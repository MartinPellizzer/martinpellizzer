                    <h1>Tillandsia latifolia var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia latifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
