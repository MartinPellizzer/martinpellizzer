<p>Tillandsia polystachia var. alba, commonly known as the white-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow, white or pale green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces delicate, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often white or pale in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
