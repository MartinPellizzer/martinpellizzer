<p>Teesdalia conferta, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow ray flowers that bloom in summer. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Teesdalia conferta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
