<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that encase its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by animals. Tristagma ameghinoi is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native environment.</p>
