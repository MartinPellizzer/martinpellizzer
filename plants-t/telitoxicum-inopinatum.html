                    <h1>Telitoxicum inopinatum</h1>
<p>Telitoxicum inopinatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees in swamps. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Telitoxicum inopinatum remains critically endangered in the wild.</p>
