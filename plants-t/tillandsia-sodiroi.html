                    <h1>Tillandsia sodiroi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
