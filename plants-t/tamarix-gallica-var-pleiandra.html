<p>Tamarix gallica var. pleiandra, commonly known as the pink tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profuse display of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has feathery, scale-like leaves and produces woody, branching stems that can become quite woody with age. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a windbreak due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
