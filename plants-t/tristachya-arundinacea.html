                    <h1>Tristachya arundinacea</h1>
<p>Tristachya arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features hollow, bamboo-like stems that are often used in basketry and construction. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It thrives in wetland environments and is highly adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native habitats.</p>
