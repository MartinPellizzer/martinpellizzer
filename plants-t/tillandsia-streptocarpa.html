                    <h1>Tillandsia streptocarpa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia streptocarpa, commonly known as the Crimson Violet Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
