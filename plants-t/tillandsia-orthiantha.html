                    <h1>Tillandsia orthiantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia orthiantha, commonly known as the silver vellum airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a striking silvery appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Tillandsia orthiantha is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
