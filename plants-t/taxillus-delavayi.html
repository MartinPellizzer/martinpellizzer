                    <h1>Taxillus delavayi</h1>
<p>Taxillus delavayi, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host plants, primarily members of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract pollinators. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus delavayi is often found in mountainous regions of China and is an important component of its ecological community.</p>
