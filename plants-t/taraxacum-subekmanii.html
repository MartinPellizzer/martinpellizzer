                    <h1>Taraxacum subekmanii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subekmanii, commonly known as the Subekman's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a parachute-like structure called a pappus. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
