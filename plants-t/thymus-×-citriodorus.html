                    <h1>Thymus × citriodorus</h1>
<p>Thymus × citriodorus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a hybrid perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, slightly hairy, and often grey-green leaves that emit a citrus-like fragrance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Lemon thyme thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol and linalool, are valued in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
