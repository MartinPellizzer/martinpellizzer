<p>Tillandsia lajensis, commonly known as the Lajensia air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture. It produces small, colorful inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
