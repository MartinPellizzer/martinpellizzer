<p>Taraxacum erythrospermum subsp.</p>
<p>gotlandicum, commonly known as Gotland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Baltic region. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads and a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports the flowering head, which consists of numerous small, yellow tubular flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or calcareous soils and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
