                    <h1>Triticum durum var. ramoso-obscurum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. ramoso-obscurum, commonly known as the dark branched durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its dark-colored, branched glumes.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for semolina production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Its dark pigmentation is due to the accumulation of phenolic compounds, which contribute to its unique appearance and potential nutritional properties.</p>
<p>This variety is often studied for its role in traditional agriculture and its adaptability to various climatic conditions.</p>
