<p>Tanacetum polycephalum subsp.</p>
<p>polycephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which also contribute to its historical use in medicinal and pesticidal applications.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender leaves compared to other varieties within the Tanacetum genus.</p>
