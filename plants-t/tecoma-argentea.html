                    <h1>Tecoma argentea</h1>
<p>Tecoma argentea, commonly known as silver trumpet bush, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular, silver-gray flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick, corky layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tecoma argentea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
