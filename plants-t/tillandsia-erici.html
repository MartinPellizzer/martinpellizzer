                    <h1>Tillandsia erici</h1>
<p>Tillandsia erici, commonly known as the Eric's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
