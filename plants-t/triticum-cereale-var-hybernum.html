                    <h1>Triticum cereale var. hybernum</h1>
<p>Triticum cereale var. hybernum, commonly known as the hexaploid wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its hexaploid genome, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Botanically, it features spikelets that are typically arranged in a compact, cylindrical inflorescence, with lemmas and paleas that protect the florets. The grains are usually hard and have a high protein content, making them valuable for bread-making.</p>
<p>Its morphology and genetic makeup make it an important species in both agricultural and botanical studies.</p>
