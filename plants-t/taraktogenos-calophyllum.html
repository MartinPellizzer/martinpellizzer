<p>Taraktogenos calophyllum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and the fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by water.</p>
