                    <h1>Tormentilla erecta parviflora</h1>
<p>Tormentilla erecta parviflora, commonly known as the slender willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
