                    <h1>Trisetum spicatum var. majus</h1>
<p>Trisetum spicatum var. majus, commonly known as the tall quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
