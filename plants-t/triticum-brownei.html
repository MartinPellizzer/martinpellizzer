                    <h1>Triticum brownei</h1>
<p>Triticum brownei, commonly known as the Brown's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like structure with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear florets with three bracts, typical of the wheat genus. Triticum brownei is notable for its genetic diversity and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
