                    <h1>Triodon decumbens</h1>
<p>Triodon decumbens, commonly known as the creeping triodon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
