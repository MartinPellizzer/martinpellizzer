<p>Thelypteris andicola, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and often have a wavy or serrated edge. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, forested areas at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across rocky or soil-covered substrates.</p>
<p>Thelypteris andicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
