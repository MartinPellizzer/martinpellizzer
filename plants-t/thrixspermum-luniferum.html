<p>Thrixspermum luniferum, commonly known as the moon-bearing thrix, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its scientific name reflects its association with the moon, as its nocturnal blooming pattern is believed to be influenced by lunar cycles.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
