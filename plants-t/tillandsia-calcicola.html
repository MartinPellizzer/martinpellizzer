                    <h1>Tillandsia calcicola</h1>
<p>Tillandsia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous environments, such as limestone rocks and cliffs, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its substrate while also facilitating water uptake. Its foliage is typically grayish-green, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tillandsia calcicola is a rosette-forming plant that produces small, white or pale pink flowers, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
