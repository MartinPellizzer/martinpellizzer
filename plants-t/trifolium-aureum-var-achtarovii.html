<p>Trifolium aureum var. achtarovii, commonly known as the Achtarovii yellow clover, is a variant of the yellow clover species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight pubescence. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
