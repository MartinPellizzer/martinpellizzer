<p>Toxicodendron acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of three. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in woodland and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant is known for causing a skin rash due to the presence of urushiol, an oily resin found in its leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
