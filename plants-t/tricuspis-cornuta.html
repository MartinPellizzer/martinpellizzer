<p>Tricuspis cornuta, commonly known as the horned tricuspis, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and spiky, horn-like structures on its stems.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual morphology.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
