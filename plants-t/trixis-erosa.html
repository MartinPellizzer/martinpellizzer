                    <h1>Trixis erosa</h1>
<p>Trixis erosa, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Trixis erosa plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
