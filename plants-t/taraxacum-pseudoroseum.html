<p>Taraxacum pseudoroseum, commonly known as the pink dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright pink to rose-colored flowers, which contrast with its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower head, which consists of numerous small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique floral coloration.</p>
