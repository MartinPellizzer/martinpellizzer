                    <h1>Triticum sunpanii</h1>
<p>Triticum sunpanii, commonly known as the Sunpanii wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the wheat genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including slender stems and small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in wheat breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
