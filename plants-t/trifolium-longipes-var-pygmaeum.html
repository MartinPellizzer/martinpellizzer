<p>Trifolium longipes var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf longipes clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, with a hairy texture and a pale green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
