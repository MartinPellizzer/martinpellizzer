<p>Taraxacum laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>schroeterianum, commonly known as the Schr√∂ter's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that becomes fibrous and persists after flowering. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its morphological variation and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance.</p>
