                    <h1>Tillandsia pseudostricta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pseudostricta, commonly known as the silver rosette air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped structure composed of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
