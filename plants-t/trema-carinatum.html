                    <h1>Trema carinatum</h1>
<p>Trema carinatum, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Trema carinatum is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils.</p>
