<p>Thelocactus bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored thorn cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a distinct yellowish or orange coloration on the upper parts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its consistent bicoloration, which sets it apart from other similar cactus species.</p>
