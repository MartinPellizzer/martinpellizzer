                    <h1>Taraxacum grypodiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum grypodiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which develop into a distinctive spherical seed head with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
