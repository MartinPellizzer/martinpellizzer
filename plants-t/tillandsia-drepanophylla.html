                    <h1>Tillandsia drepanophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia drepanophylla, commonly known as the panama hat air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, umbrella-like structure. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where traditional soil-based plants might struggle.</p>
