<p>Trichocentrum andrewsiae, commonly known as the Andrews' spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, often with a contrasting red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum andrewsiae is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
