                    <h1>Trifolium gracilentum var. reductum</h1>
<p>Trifolium gracilentum var. reductum, commonly known as the reduced clover, is a lesser-known variant of the trifoliate clover species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to its parent species. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves with three leaflets that are often more rounded and shorter in length. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant variation and adaptation.</p>
