<p>Taraxacum argilliticola, commonly known as the clay dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to thrive in clay-rich soils. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed ball with bristly seeds. It is often found in moist, calcareous environments, such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
