                    <h1>Tillandsia oxapampae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia oxapampae, commonly known as the Oxapampa air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
