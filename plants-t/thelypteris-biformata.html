                    <h1>Thelypteris biformata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris biformata, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
