<p>Trifolium roscidum, commonly known as the dewy clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in temperate climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Trifolium roscidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
