                    <h1>Tamarix austroafricana</h1>
<p>Tamarix austroafricana, commonly known as the Namib Desert tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink or pale red flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>
<p>Tamarix austroafricana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
