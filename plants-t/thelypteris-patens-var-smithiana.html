                    <h1>Thelypteris patens var. smithiana</h1>
<p>Thelypteris patens var. smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its broad, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize suitable habitats.</p>
