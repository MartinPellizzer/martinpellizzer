<p>Tubella carmeniae, commonly known as the Carmen's tube worm, is a species of polychaete annelid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and the presence of a tubular structure on its head. This marine organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it inhabits sandy or muddy substrates. The tubular structure is believed to serve as a feeding organ, helping the animal filter food from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and specialized anatomy make it an interesting subject for marine biological studies.</p>
