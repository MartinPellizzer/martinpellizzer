                    <h1>Taraxacum bulbosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that rises from the center of the rosette, topped with a flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Taraxacum bulbosum is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
