<p>Tephroseris hyperborealis subsp.</p>
<p>wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel Island saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions, particularly found on Wrangel Island in the Chukchi Sea. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky and barren environments, often growing on tundra and coastal cliffs. It is adapted to cold climates and has a specialized root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
