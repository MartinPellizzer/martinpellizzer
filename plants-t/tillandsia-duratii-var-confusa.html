                    <h1>Tillandsia duratii var. confusa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia duratii var. confusa, commonly known as the cloud fern tillandsia, is a rare epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine trichomes, which aid in water absorption from the air.</p>
<p>This variety is highly sought after by bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and challenging cultivation requirements.</p>
