                    <h1>Tillandsia ionantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ionantha, commonly known as the silver pine or miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ionantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
