                    <h1>Theodorea auriculata</h1>
<p>Theodorea auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Theodorea auriculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
