                    <h1>Tongoloa stewardii</h1>
<p>Tongoloa stewardii, commonly known as the Steward's tongue plant, is a unique species native to the island of Tongatapu in the Tonga archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to the island's dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tongoloa stewardii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
