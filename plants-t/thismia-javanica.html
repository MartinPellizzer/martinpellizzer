                    <h1>Thismia javanica</h1>
<p>Thismia javanica, commonly known as the Java ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its unique, often pale or translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, with a distinctive shape that resembles a ghostly or spectral form.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Thismia javanica is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
