                    <h1>Tillandsia carrierei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carrierei, commonly known as the Carri√®re's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia carrierei is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
