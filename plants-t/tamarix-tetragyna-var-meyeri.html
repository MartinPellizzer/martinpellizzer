                    <h1>Tamarix tetragyna var. meyeri</h1>
<p>Tamarix tetragyna var. meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces pink to red flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it resilient in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common species in restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
