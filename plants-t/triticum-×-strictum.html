                    <h1>Triticum × strictum</h1>
<p>Triticum × strictum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other wild grasses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are typical of many grass species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, each containing a single grain. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for genetic research due to its potential contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
<p>Triticum × strictum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, making it a resilient wild relative of cultivated wheat.</p>
