<p>Thelypteris stipellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf matted shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous stolons, which help in spreading and forming colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance.</p>
