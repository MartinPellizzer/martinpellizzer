                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. rubrum</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. rubrum, commonly known as red einkorn, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is a diploid wheat with a small genome size and is characterized by its reddish husk and high protein content. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets with awns. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>The grain is harvested when the husks turn from green to a reddish-brown color, indicating maturity.</p>
