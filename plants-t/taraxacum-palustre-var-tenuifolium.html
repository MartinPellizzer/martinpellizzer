<p>Taraxacum palustre var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed ball, characteristic of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other dandelion species.</p>
