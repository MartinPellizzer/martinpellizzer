<p>Theopsis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to dandelions, and it is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Theopsis fluviatilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
