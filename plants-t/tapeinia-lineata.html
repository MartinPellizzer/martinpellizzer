<p>Tapeinia lineata, commonly known as the lineated rust fungus, is a parasitic plant pathogen that primarily affects grasses.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pucciniales and is characterized by its distinct, yellow-orange pustules that appear on the leaves of its host plants. The fungus produces spores in chains, which are released into the air to infect new hosts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in agricultural and natural grassland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental grasses.</p>
