<p>Turbinicarpus subterraneus subsp.</p>
<p>zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and sparsely distributed, white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
