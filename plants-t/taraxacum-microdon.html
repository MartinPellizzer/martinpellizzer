<p>Taraxacum microdon, commonly known as the microdon dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive spherical, spiky seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum microdon is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
