<p>Thelocactus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's thistle cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, often forming a dense, columnar structure. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne at the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Thelocactus johnsonii is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
