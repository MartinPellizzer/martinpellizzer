<p>Tmesipteris tugana, commonly known as the Tugana water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing minerals from the water.</p>
<p>Tmesipteris tugana plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
