                    <h1>Tillandsia grandis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia grandis, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia grandis is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
