                    <h1>Thunbergianthus ruwenzoriensis</h1>
<p>Thunbergianthus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mistflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, velvety blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the cooler months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise subtle appearance. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora and adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
