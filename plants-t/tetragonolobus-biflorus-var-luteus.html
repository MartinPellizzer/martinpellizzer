<p>Tetragonolobus biflorus var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a legume characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
