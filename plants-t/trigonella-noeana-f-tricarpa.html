                    <h1>Trigonella noeana f. tricarpa</h1>
<p>Trigonella noeana f. tricarpa, commonly known as the three-seeded fenugreek, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the fenugreek genus.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive three-lobed pods, which give it its specific epithet "tricarpa.". Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
