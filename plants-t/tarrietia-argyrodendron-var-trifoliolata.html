                    <h1>Tarrietia argyrodendron var. trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Tarrietia argyrodendron var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
