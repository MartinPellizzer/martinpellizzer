                    <h1>Taraxacum anadyricum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum anadyricum, commonly known as the Anadyr dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and alpine meadows, where it forms a rosette of narrow, silver-haired leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
