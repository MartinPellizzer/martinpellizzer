<p>Trichomanes multifidum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, evergreen moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant forms dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor, often found in temperate and subarctic regions. Trichomanes multifidum reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the stems.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth pattern make it an important component of many forest ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
