                    <h1>Triticum tenuiculum</h1>
<p>Triticum tenuiculum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikes that bear numerousé¢– (glumes) and lemma-like structures. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in wheat breeding programs.</p>
