                    <h1>Tragia urticifolia var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Tragia urticifolia var. laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf tragia, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
