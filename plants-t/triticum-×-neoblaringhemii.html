                    <h1>Triticum × neoblaringhemii</h1>
<p>Triticum × neoblaringhemii, commonly known as the hybrid wheat, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii.</p>
<p>It possesses a genome composition of AABBRR, combining the genomes of its parental species. This plant is notable for its potential in wheat breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The botanical features include robust growth habits and the ability to thrive in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its development has contributed to the creation of new wheat varieties with improved traits such as yield and disease resistance.</p>
