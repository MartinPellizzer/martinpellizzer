                    <h1>Trasus</h1>
<p>Trasus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, translucent, waxy flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the branches of trees in swampy areas. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Trasus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
