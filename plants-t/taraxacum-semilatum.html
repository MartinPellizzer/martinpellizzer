                    <h1>Taraxacum semilatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum semilatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical seed sphere with white pappus. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
