                    <h1>Taraxacum nitens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum nitens, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, tall, leafless stem topped with a composite flower head that transitions from yellow to white as it matures. Its flowers are followed by a spherical, hairy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind.</p>
<p>Taraxacum nitens is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
