<p>Tinantia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fern or giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnate segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Tinantia macrophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
