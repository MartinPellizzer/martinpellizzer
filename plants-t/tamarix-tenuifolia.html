<p>Tamarix tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often blue-green leaves and small, pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or saline soils. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
