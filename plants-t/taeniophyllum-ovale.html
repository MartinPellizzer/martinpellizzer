                    <h1>Taeniophyllum ovale</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum ovale, commonly known as the oval taeniophyllum, is a small, epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum ovale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
