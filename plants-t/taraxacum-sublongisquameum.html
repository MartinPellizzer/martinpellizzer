<p>Taraxacum sublongisquameum, commonly known as the long-scale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, white, pappus-equipped seed head that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
