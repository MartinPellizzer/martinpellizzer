                    <h1>Tillandsia inconspicua</h1>
<p>Tillandsia inconspicua, commonly known as the small air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid forest environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
