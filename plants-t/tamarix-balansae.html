<p>Tamarix balansae, commonly known as the Balansae tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments.</p>
<p>Tamarix balansae is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in arid areas.</p>
