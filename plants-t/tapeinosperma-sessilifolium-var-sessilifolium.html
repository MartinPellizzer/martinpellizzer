                    <h1>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium var. sessilifolium</h1>
<p>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kangaroo apple, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is a component of the fynbos vegetation in its native range.</p>
