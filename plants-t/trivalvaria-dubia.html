                    <h1>Trivalvaria dubia</h1>
<p>Trivalvaria dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Trivalvaria dubia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
