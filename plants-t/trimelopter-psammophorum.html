<p>Trimelopter psammophorum, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to withstand harsh conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
