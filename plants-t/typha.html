                    <h1>Typha</h1>
<p>Typha, commonly known as cattail, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants found in wetlands around the world.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, brownish flower spike that resembles a tail, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. Typha species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to filter water and stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>They also provide habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
