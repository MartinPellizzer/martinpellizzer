<p>Thelypteris jaculosa, commonly known as the spurred water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are released during the wet season.</p>
<p>The spurred water fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
