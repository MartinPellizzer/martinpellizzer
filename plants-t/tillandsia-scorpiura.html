                    <h1>Tillandsia scorpiura</h1>
<p>Tillandsia scorpiura, commonly known as the Scorpioid air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a subtle beauty to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for environments with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
