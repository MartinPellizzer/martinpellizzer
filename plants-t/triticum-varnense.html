                    <h1>Triticum varnense</h1>
<p>Triticum varnense, commonly known as the Armenian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, tan-colored grains. This plant is often found in rocky soils and high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs.</p>
<p>Triticum varnense is also valued for its role in ecological studies and as a source of genetic diversity in cereal crops.</p>
