                    <h1>Topobea tetroici</h1>
<p>Topobea tetroici, commonly known as the four-cornered topobea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Topobea tetroici plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
