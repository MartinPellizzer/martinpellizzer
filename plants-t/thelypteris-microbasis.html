<p>Thelypteris microbasis, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris microbasis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
