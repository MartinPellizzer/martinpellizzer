                    <h1>Tetranthera salicifolia var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Tetranthera salicifolia var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender willow fern, is a variant of the willow fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in moisture retention.</p>
