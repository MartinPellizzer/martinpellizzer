<p>Trichosanthes cucumerina var. lobata, commonly known as the lobed bitter melon, is a variant of the bitter melon species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The fruit is typically elongated, with a warty surface and a bitter taste, though it is used in traditional medicine and cooking. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other Trichosanthes species, particularly in leaf morphology and fruit structure.</p>
