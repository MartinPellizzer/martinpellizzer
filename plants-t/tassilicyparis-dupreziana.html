                    <h1>Tassilicyparis dupreziana</h1>
<p>Tassilicyparis dupreziana, commonly known as the Duprez's cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, typical of coniferous species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relict species with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical specimen from further decline.</p>
