<p>Tillandsia valenzuelana, commonly known as the Valenzuelan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia valenzuelana is popular as a decorative plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
