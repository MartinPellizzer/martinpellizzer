                    <h1>Thrixspermum tsii</h1>
<p>Thrixspermum tsii, commonly known as the Chinese thrixspermum, is a rare and enigmatic member of the family Celastraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and are followed by small, red berries that persist into the winter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thrixspermum tsii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
