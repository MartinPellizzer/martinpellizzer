<p>Thlaspi abulense var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils across northern regions. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its unique ability to trap small aquatic organisms in its bladder-like structures, which are specialized leaves.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nutrient cycling and its adaptation to wetland environments.</p>
