                    <h1>Tillandsia mezii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mezii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia mezii is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
