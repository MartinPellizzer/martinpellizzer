                    <h1>Thelypteris sancta var. magna</h1>
<p>Thelypteris sancta var. magna, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Athyriaceae.</p>
