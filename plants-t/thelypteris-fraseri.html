<p>Thelypteris fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
