                    <h1>Tapinanthus kisantuensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus kisantuensis, commonly known as the Kisantu dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit. It is often found in moist, forested areas and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying plant parasitism.</p>
