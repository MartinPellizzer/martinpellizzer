                    <h1>Tapinanthus rufescens</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with fine, thread-like roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found parasitizing members of the legume family.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants.</p>
