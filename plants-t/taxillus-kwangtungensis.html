                    <h1>Taxillus kwangtungensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to southern China and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in ecological interactions and biodiversity.</p>
