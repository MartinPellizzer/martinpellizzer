                    <h1>Typhonium phuocbinhense</h1>
<p>Typhonium phuocbinhense, commonly known as Phuoc Binh arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Vietnam, specifically found in the Phuoc Binh region, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, typical of many arum species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
