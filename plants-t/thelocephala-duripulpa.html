                    <h1>Thelocephala duripulpa</h1>
<p>Thelocephala duripulpa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found on stone surfaces in deserts and mountainous regions. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
