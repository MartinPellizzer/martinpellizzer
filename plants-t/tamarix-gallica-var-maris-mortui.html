                    <h1>Tamarix gallica var. maris-mortui</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica var. maris-mortui, commonly known as the Sea Lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for coastal landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
