                    <h1>Tetranthus berteroi</h1>
<p>Tetranthus berteroi, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Tetranthus berteroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
