                    <h1>Tragacantha lepidantha</h1>
<p>Tragacantha lepidantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha lepidantha is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
