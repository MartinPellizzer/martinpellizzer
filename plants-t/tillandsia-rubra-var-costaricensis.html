                    <h1>Tillandsia rubra var. costaricensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rubra var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among bromeliophiles for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
