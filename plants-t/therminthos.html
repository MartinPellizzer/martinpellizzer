                    <h1>Therminthos</h1>
<p>Therminthos, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically small and narrow, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Therminthos is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
