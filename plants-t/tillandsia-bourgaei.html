                    <h1>Tillandsia bourgaei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bourgaei, commonly known as the Bourgae's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bourgaei is well adapted to humid, shaded conditions and requires minimal soil contact for growth.</p>
