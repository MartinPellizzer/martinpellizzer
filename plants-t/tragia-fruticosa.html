                    <h1>Tragia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Tragia fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule that bursts open when mature to disperse seeds.</p>
<p>Tragia fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
