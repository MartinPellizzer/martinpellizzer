<p>Trichomanes craspedoneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Trichomanes craspedoneurum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
