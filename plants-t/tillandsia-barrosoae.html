                    <h1>Tillandsia barrosoae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia barrosoae, commonly known as the Barroso's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
