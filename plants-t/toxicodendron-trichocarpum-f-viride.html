                    <h1>Toxicodendron trichocarpum f. viride</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron trichocarpum f. viride, commonly known as the green-fruited sumac, is a variant of the staghorn sumac native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and green, lobed leaves that are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clusters of green, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic resin found in its leaves and stems.</p>
