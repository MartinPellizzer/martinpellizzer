                            <h1>Tephrosia Polyphylla</h1>
<p>Tephrosia polyphylla is a unique flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is known for its striking clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its leaves are compound and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Despite its beauty, Tephrosia polyphylla is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries.</p>
