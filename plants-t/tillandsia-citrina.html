<p>Tillandsia citrina, commonly known as the yellow tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves rather than roots is a key feature of its botanical adaptation.</p>
