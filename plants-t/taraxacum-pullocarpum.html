                    <h1>Taraxacum pullocarpum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pullocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a pappus, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure.</p>
