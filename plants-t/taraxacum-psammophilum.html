                    <h1>Taraxacum psammophilum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Taraxacum psammophilum is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
