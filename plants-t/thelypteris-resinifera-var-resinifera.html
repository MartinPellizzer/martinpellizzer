                    <h1>Thelypteris resinifera var. resinifera</h1>
<p>Thelypteris resinifera var. resinifera, commonly known as the resinous water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in moist soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
