                    <h1>Thismia labiata</h1>
<p>Thismia labiata, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces striking, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is typically found growing epiphytically on tree trunks or branches in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
