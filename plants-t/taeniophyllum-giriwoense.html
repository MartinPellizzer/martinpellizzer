<p>Taeniophyllum giriwoense, commonly known as the Giriwoen moss, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
