                    <h1>Telipogon vampyrus</h1>
<p>Telipogon vampyrus, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and short, hairy stems. Native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical forests in Southeast Asia, it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant's unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
