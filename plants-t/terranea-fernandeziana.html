                    <h1>Terranea fernandeziana</h1>
<p>Terranea fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in moist soil near streams and coastal areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Terranea fernandeziana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
