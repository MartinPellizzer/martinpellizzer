<p>Trachomitum venetum subsp.</p>
<p>armenum, commonly known as Armenian trachomitum, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in terminal clusters on the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
