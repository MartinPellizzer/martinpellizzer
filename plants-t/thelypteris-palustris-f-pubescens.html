                    <h1>Thelypteris palustris f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Thelypteris palustris f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy swamp fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to wetland habitats in North America, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
