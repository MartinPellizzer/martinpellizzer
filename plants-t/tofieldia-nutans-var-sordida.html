<p>Tofieldia nutans var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid nodding sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clumps, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which droops downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Cyperaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments.</p>
