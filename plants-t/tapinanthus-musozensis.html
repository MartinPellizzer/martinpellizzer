<p>Tapinanthus musozensis, commonly known as the East African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an invasive species in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
