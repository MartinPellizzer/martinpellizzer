                    <h1>Tilia roseana</h1>
<p>Tilia roseana, commonly known as the roseleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are tinged with pink or red on the underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The bark of Tilia roseana is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic value.</p>
