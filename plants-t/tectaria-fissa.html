                    <h1>Tectaria fissa</h1>
<p>Tectaria fissa, commonly known as the split shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, divided fronds that often resemble a shield, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually leathery and have a dense, velvety texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat.</p>
