                    <h1>Typha × suwensis</h1>
<p>Typha × suwensis, commonly known as the hybrid cattail, is a wetland plant that results from the cross between Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that produce a large amount of wind-pollinated pollen. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Typha × suwensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
