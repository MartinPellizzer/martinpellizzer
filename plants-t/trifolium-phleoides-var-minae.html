                    <h1>Trifolium phleoides var. minae</h1>
<p>Trifolium phleoides var. minae, commonly known as the Minah's clover, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, often found in grassland and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
