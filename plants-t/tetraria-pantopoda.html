                    <h1>Tetraria pantopoda</h1>
<p>Tetraria pantopoda, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown color, with leaf-like structures that are often curved and have a distinct midrib. Tetraria pantopoda is typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
