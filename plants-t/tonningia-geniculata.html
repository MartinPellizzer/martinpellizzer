                    <h1>Tonningia geniculata</h1>
<p>Tonningia geniculata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, twisting fronds.</p>
<p>It is a climbing epiphytic plant that thrives in humid tropical environments, often found on trees in the understory of rainforests. The plant's fronds are spirally arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance, and they are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tonningia geniculata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
