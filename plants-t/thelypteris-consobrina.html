                    <h1>Thelypteris consobrina</h1>
<p>Thelypteris consobrina, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure that distinguishes it from other ferns. Thelypteris consobrina thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a ground cover in forest ecosystems.</p>
