                    <h1>Terebinthus heterophylla</h1>
<p>Terebinthus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable terebinth, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from narrow and linear to broad and ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a rough, fissured bark, and it is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Terebinthus heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
