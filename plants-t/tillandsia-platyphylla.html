                    <h1>Tillandsia platyphylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
