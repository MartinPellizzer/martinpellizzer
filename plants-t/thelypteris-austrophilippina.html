<p>Thelypteris austrophilippina, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, floating mats on slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Thelypteris austrophilippina plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
