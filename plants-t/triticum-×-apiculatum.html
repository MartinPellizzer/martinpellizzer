                    <h1>Triticum × apiculatum</h1>
<p>Triticum × apiculatum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are often hairy and contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for improving wheat varieties.</p>
