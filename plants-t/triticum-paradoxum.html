                    <h1>Triticum paradoxum</h1>
<p>Triticum paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique genetic makeup, which includes a combination of wild and domesticated wheat traits. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, often requiring specific conditions for germination.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum paradoxum is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and crop resilience.</p>
