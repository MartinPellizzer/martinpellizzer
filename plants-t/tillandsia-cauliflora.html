                    <h1>Tillandsia cauliflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cauliflora, commonly known as the pineapple air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces offsets called pups, which can be separated and grown independently. Tillandsia cauliflora is known for its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>It blooms with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
