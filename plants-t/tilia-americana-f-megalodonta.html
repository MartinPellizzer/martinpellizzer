                    <h1>Tilia americana f. megalodonta</h1>
<p>Tilia americana f. megalodonta, commonly known as the giant American linden, is a distinctive botanical variant of the American linden tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, with a broader leaf blade and a more pronounced lobing. The plant exhibits a slower growth rate and a more upright habit, making it a unique ornamental choice. Its flowers are similar to those of the standard Tilia americana, producing fragrant, clustered blooms in early summer.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its unique foliage.</p>
