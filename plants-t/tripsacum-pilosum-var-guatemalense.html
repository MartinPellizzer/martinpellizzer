                    <h1>Tripsacum pilosum var. guatemalense</h1>
<p>Tripsacum pilosum var. guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan wild maize, is a perennial grass native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to maize, exhibiting similar structural features. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetland or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a genetic resource for maize improvement and its ecological role in native ecosystems.</p>
