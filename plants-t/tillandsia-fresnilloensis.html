                    <h1>Tillandsia fresnilloensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fresnilloensis, commonly known as the Fresnillo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
