<p>Triticum segetale, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in fields. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in varied environments.</p>
<p>Triticum segetale is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
