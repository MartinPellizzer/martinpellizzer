                    <h1>Thismia huangii</h1>
<p>Thismia huangii, commonly known as the Huang's starplant, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae, which is characterized by its unique, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph, relying on fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, Thismia huangii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
