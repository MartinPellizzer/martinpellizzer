<p>Thlaspi alpinum, commonly known as alpine cabbages or rock cabbages, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions or mats to withstand harsh conditions. Its small, green leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Thlaspi alpinum produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
