                    <h1>Tetrapogon villosus</h1>
<p>Tetrapogon villosus, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tetrapogon villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
