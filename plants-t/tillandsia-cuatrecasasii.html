                    <h1>Tillandsia cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and small white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
