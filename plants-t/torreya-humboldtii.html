<p>Torreya humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody cones containing edible, fleshy seeds. Torreya humboldtii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
