<p>Taraxacum atlanticola, commonly known as the Atlantic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its habitat.</p>
