<p>Tillandsia spiculosa var. palmana, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
