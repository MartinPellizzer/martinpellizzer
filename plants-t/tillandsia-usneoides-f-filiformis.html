                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides f. filiformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides f. filiformis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives on trees in humid environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, thread-like structures. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging strands that form dense, moss-like clusters. It is often mistaken for a parasitic plant, but it does not harm its host.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its delicate, silver-green foliage and its role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
