                    <h1>Tephrosia ascendens</h1>
<p>Tephrosia ascendens, commonly known as the climbing tephrosia, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.</p>
