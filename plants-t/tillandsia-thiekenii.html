<p>Tillandsia thiekenii, commonly known as the Tenerife air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to coastal climates.</p>
<p>Tillandsia thiekenii is known for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
