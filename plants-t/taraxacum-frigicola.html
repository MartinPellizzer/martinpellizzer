<p>Taraxacum frigicola, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This species thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head, from which lightweight seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Taraxacum frigicola is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and is often considered an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
