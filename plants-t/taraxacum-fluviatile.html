                    <h1>Taraxacum fluviatile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum fluviatile, commonly known as the river dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
