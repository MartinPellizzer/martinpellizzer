                    <h1>Tillandsia lindenii var. caeca</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lindenii var. caeca, commonly known as the caeca air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
