<p>Tylecarpus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy purple or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Tylecarpus carolinensis is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas.</p>
