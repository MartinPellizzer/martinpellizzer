                    <h1>Trapa verbanensis</h1>
<p>Trapa verbanensis, commonly known as the Verbanian water chestnut, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are circular and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help in buoyancy and light reflection. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense colonies that can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
