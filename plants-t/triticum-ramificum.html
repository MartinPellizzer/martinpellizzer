<p>Triticum ramificum, commonly known as the branched wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, branched husk, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Triticum ramificum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
