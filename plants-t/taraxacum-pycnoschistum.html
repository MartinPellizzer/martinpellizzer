                    <h1>Taraxacum pycnoschistum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pycnoschistum, commonly known as the dense-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a dense cluster. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that rises above the leaves, bearing a yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common yet distinctive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
