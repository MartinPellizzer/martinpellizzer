<p>Taxus baccata var. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing variant of the European yew.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces small, reddish-orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions.</p>
