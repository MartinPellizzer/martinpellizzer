                    <h1>Tilia venulosa var. multinervis</h1>
<p>Tilia venulosa var. multinervis, commonly known as the multivenered linden, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the linden tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely veined leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other linden species. The plant is native to parts of eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers, which appear in early summer, are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, sweet scent that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
