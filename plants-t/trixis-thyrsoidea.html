<p>Trixis thyrsoidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. Its leaves are hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trixis thyrsoidea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
