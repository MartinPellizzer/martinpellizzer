                    <h1>Tillandsia nuttalliana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nuttalliana, commonly known as the Nuttall's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
