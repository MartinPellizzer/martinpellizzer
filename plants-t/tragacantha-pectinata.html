                    <h1>Tragacantha pectinata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha pectinata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods that contain the valuable gum tragacanth. This gum is used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, due to its thickening and binding properties.</p>
<p>Tragacantha pectinata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and economically important species in its native range.</p>
