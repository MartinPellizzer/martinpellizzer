                    <h1>Tamarix gallica var. subpatens</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica var. subpatens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or pale pink flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody pods. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species for coastal and dryland areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it both useful for erosion control and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
