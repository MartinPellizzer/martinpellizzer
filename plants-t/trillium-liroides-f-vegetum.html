<p>Trillium liroides f. vegetum, commonly known as the green-flowered trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the trillium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, almost entirely green flowers, which set it apart from the typical white or pink flowers of other trillium species. This plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. Its foliage consists of three large, heart-shaped leaves that emerge before the flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is a perennial herb that produces a single, upright stem bearing the distinctive green blooms.</p>
