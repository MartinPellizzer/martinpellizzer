                    <h1>Tragacantha crassa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha crassa, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
