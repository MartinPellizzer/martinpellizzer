                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. mansfeldii</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. mansfeldii, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Fertile Crescent and exhibits a range of morphological and genetic traits that make it valuable for genetic research. This plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, hard grains that are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest for its potential contributions to improving drought resistance and yield in cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
