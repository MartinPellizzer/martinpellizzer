                    <h1>Taraxacum atrox</h1>
<p>Taraxacum atrox, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion family. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Taraxacum atrox is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
