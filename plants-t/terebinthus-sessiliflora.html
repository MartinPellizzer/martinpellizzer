                    <h1>Terebinthus sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Terebinthus sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaf terebinth, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
