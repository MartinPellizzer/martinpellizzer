                    <h1>Tillandsia kurt-horstii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kurt-horstii, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
