                    <h1>Taxillus caloreas var. fargesii</h1>
<p>Taxillus caloreas var. fargesii, commonly known as the parasitic vine or Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus Fagus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small berries that contain the seeds. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth and health of its host trees if not managed.</p>
