                    <h1>Triticum magellanicum var. pubiflorum</h1>
<p>Triticum magellanicum var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the Magellanic wheat, is a rare and lesser-known variety of wheat native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) florets, which give it its specific epithet "pubiflorum.". The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. It has a compact growth habit with slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders.</p>
