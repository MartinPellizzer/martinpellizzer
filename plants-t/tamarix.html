                    <h1>Tamarix</h1>
<p>Tamarix, commonly known as the salt cedar or tamarisk, is a genus of about 100 species of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs or small trees are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. They are characterized by their feathery leaves, which are often reduced to scale-like structures, and their pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. Tamarix species are adapted to saline and drought conditions, making them resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Their rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to their classification as invasive in many regions.</p>
