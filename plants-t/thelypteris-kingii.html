<p>Thelypteris kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris kingii plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals.</p>
