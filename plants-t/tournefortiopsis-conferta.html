                    <h1>Tournefortiopsis conferta</h1>
<p>Tournefortiopsis conferta, commonly known as the dense turban snakeweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its tough appearance, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
