                    <h1>Trisetum neglectum</h1>
<p>Trisetum neglectum, commonly known as the neglected trisetum, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Trisetum neglectum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
