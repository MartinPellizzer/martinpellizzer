                    <h1>Trigonia macrostachya</h1>
<p>Trigonia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
