<p>Tamarix cupressiformis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for bark, giving it a unique, almost woody appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Tamarix cupressiformis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
