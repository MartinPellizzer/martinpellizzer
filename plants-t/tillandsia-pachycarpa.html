<p>Tillandsia pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a striking violet or purple coloration.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pachycarpa is popular among collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
