                    <h1>Tillandsia carnosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carnosa, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often pink or red, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
