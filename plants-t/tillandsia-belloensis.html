                    <h1>Tillandsia belloensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia belloensis, commonly known as the Bello's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
