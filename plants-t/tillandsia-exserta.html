<p>Tillandsia exserta, commonly known as the "Tillandsia exserta" or "Air Plant," is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid climates. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia exserta produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
