                    <h1>Tetraria fasciata</h1>
<p>Tetraria fasciata, commonly known as the ribboned cushion moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its distinctive, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in two rows. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stems known as setae.</p>
<p>Tetraria fasciata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
