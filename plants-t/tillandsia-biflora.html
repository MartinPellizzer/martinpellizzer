                    <h1>Tillandsia biflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces two showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia biflora is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
