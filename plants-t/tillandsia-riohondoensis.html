                    <h1>Tillandsia riohondoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia riohondoensis, commonly known as the Rio Hondo airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions by capturing water and nutrients through its foliage.</p>
