<p>Tubella jimburae, commonly known as the Jimbura tubeworm, is a species of marine polychaete annelid found in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and the presence of a distinctive, tubular structure on its head. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its classification within the phylum Annelida, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in sandy seabed environments and is often found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>Tubella jimburae plays a role in sediment stabilization and serves as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
