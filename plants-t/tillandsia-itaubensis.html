                    <h1>Tillandsia itaubensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia itaubensis, commonly known as the Ita√∫ba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among collectors and indoor gardeners.</p>
