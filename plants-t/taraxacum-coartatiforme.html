                    <h1>Taraxacum coartatiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum coartatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a capsule that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The species is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its distinctive leaf shape and smaller flower head.</p>
