<p>Taeniophyllum appendiculatum, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure with leaf-like appendages that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum appendiculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
