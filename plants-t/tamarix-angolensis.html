                    <h1>Tamarix angolensis</h1>
<p>Tamarix angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces compact, spherical seed pods that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and saline soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix angolensis is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
