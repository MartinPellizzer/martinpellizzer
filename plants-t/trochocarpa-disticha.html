<p>Trochocarpa disticha, commonly known as the twin-leaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Trochocarpa disticha is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high sunlight exposure.</p>
