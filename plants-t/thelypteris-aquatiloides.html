<p>Thelypteris aquatiloides, commonly known as the water shield fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are adapted to thrive in waterlogged or submerged conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the surface of still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>Thelypteris aquatiloides plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
