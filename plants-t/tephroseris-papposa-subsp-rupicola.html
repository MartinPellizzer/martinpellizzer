<p>Tephroseris papposa subsp.</p>
<p>rupicola, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem bearing yellow flowers that are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
