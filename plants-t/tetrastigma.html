<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in its growth along supports. The leaves are typically lobed or deeply divided, with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. Tetrastigma species are native to Asia, particularly China, and are often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>These plants produce small, greenish-white flowers and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
