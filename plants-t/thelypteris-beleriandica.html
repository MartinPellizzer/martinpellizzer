<p>It is a medium-sized fern with lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Thelypteris beleriandica plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
