                    <h1>Tormentilla sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Tormentilla sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
