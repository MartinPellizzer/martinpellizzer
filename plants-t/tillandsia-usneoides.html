                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that attaches itself to trees without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Latin America. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its aerial roots. Its long, hanging strands create a dense, lace-like appearance, often giving the illusion of a living carpet on trees.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to photosynthesize and its unique structure that allows it to survive in a variety of ecological niches.</p>
