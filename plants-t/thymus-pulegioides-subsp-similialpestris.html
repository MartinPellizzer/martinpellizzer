<p>Thymus pulegioides subsp.</p>
<p>similialpestris, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
