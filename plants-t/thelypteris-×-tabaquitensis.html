                    <h1>Thelypteris × tabaquitensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × tabaquitensis, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Thelypteris acutifolia and Thelypteris jamaicensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous layer called an indusium. Thelypteris × tabaquitensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the fern family.</p>
