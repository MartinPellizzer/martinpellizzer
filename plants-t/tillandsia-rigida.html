                    <h1>Tillandsia rigida</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rigida, commonly known as the rigid air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rigida is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to survive with minimal care.</p>
