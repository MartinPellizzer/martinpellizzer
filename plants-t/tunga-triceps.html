                    <h1>Tunga triceps</h1>
<p>Tunga triceps, commonly known as the chigoe flea, is a parasitic insect that primarily infests the skin of mammals, including humans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tungidae and is known for its unique life cycle, which involves a larval stage that burrows into the skin. The adult flea does not feed on blood but relies on the host's immune response for sustenance. Botanically, it is not a plant but an arthropod, so its study falls under zoology rather than botany.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact on plant hosts can be significant due to the stress caused by infestation.</p>
