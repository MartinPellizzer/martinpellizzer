                    <h1>Tarachia polystichoides</h1>
<p>Tarachia polystichoides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and ability to store water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a low profile and minimal water requirements.</p>
