                    <h1>Trichomanes muscoides var. minus</h1>
<p>Trichomanes muscoides var. minus, commonly known as the lesser tassel fern, is a small, terrestrial fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically clustered on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its diminutive size and specialized habitat, it is a relatively rare and less commonly encountered fern species.</p>
