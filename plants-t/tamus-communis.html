                    <h1>Tamus communis</h1>
<p>Tamus communis, commonly known as the common bird's-nest, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that form a protective layer around its flowering structures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in a central umbel that resembles a bird's nest, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
