                    <h1>Tragia mitis var. cinerea</h1>
<p>Tragia mitis var. cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf tragia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Tragia mitis var. cinerea is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
