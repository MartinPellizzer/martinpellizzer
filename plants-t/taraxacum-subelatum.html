                    <h1>Taraxacum subelatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subelatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports its showy, wind-pollinated inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum subelatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
