                    <h1>Taraxacum falcatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum falcatum, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often hairy stem that supports the flower head. Its seeds are dispersed by the wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus.</p>
<p>Taraxacum falcatum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
