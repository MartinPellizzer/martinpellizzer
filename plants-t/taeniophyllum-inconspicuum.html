                    <h1>Taeniophyllum inconspicuum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum inconspicuum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It grows on trees and rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its subtle appearance and limited distribution, it is a rare and understudied species in the botanical world.</p>
