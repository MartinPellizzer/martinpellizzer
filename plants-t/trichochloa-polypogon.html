                    <h1>Trichochloa polypogon</h1>
<p>Trichochloa polypogon, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, marshes, and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Trichochloa polypogon is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals.</p>
