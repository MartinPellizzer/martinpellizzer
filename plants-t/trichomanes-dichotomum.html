<p>Trichomanes dichotomum, commonly known as the fork fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dichotomous branching fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually short and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trichomanes dichotomum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the understory vegetation of humid forests.</p>
