                    <h1>Trixis verbasciformis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Trixis verbasciformis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate trixis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, woolly leaves that are lanceolate in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces upright, branching stems that bear yellow-orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical forms of Trixis verbasciformis.</p>
