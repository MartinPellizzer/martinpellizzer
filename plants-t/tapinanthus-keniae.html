                    <h1>Tapinanthus keniae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus keniae, commonly known as the Kenyan dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to eastern Africa, particularly Kenya. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure that allows it to attach to its host. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death.</p>
