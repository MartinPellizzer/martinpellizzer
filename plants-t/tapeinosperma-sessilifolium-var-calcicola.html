                    <h1>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola variant of the sessilifoliate tapeinosperma, is a plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic adaptations. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich areas.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
