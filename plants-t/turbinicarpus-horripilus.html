<p>Turbinicarpus horripilus, commonly known as the hairy turbinated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
