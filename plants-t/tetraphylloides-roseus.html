                    <h1>Tetraphylloides roseus</h1>
<p>Tetraphylloides roseus, commonly known as the rose-colored liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a dense, cushion-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tetraphylloides roseus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
