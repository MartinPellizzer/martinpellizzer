                    <h1>Toelkenia lactea</h1>
<p>Toelkenia lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Toelkenia lactea is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains chemicals that can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
