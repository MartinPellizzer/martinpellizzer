<p>Tephroseris helenitis subsp.</p>
<p>salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg helenean, is a rare alpine plant native to the Central Alps. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
