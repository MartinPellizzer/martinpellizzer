<p>Trichomanes rhizophyllum, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant possesses a rhizome that allows it to spread horizontally along the substrate, forming dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes rhizophyllum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
