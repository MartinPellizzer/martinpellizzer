                    <h1>Tillandsia nervata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nervata, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nervata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
