<p>Toxicodendron copallinum, commonly known as the copallinum sumac, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Like other members of the Anacardiaceae family, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans.</p>
