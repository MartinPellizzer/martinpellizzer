                    <h1>Tetraria involucrata</h1>
<p>Tetraria involucrata, commonly known as the curled cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly curled thallus that resembles a small cup or shell, providing a unique habitat for microorganisms. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, typical of lichen biology. It is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized morphology make it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
