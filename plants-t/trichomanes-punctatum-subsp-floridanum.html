<p>Trichomanes punctatum subsp.</p>
<p>floridanum, commonly known as Florida maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in minute, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
