<p>Tanacetum multicaule, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic and emit a sharp, camphor-like scent. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Tanacetum multicaule is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
