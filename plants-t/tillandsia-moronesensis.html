<p>Tillandsia moronesensis, commonly known as the Morones' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia moronesensis is adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect light conditions.</p>
