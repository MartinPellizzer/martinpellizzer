<p>Telis halophila, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small greenish-white flowers, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Telis halophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
