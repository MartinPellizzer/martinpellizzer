                    <h1>Thuja kongoensis</h1>
<p>Thuja kongoensis, commonly known as the African thuja, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high altitudes of central and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable species for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
