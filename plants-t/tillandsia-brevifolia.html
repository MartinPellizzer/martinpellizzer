                    <h1>Tillandsia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are short and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white in color.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions.</p>
