                    <h1>Tectaria phaeocaulos</h1>
<p>Tectaria phaeocaulos, commonly known as the dark-stemmed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark-colored stems and broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
