<p>Trifolium fucatum var. gambelii, commonly known as Gambel's red clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is an important forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
