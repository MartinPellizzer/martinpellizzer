                    <h1>Tormentilla erecta var. sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Tormentilla erecta var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparsely-flowered willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on very short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and hardy nature, it is a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
