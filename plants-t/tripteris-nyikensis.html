<p>Tripteris nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyik√©nsis tripteris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Tripteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several narrow, serrated leaflets. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tripteris nyikensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
