                    <h1>Taraxacum caloschistum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum caloschistum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, hollow stem with bracts, typical of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are usually basal, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum caloschistum is often found in limestone soils and is well-suited to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained habitats.</p>
