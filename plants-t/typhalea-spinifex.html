                    <h1>Typhalea spinifex</h1>
<p>Typhalea spinifex, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of wiry, needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, featuring deep root systems and waxy leaf coatings to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Typhalea spinifex plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
