                    <h1>Trevirana heterophylla</h1>
<p>Trevirana heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf trevirana, is a unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its morphological variation, with leaves that can differ significantly in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trevirana heterophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
