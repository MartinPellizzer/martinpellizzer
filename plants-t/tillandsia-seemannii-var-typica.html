<p>Tillandsia seemannii var. typica, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a silvery-white coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive pink or red hue.</p>
<p>This species is popular in horticulture due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
