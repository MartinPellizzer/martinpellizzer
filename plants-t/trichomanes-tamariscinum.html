The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
