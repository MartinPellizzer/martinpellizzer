                    <h1>Thelypodiopsis sagittata var. ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Thelypodiopsis sagittata var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white or greenish flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water efficiently, adapting to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, contributing to the stabilization of dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
