                    <h1>Tapinanthus entebbensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus entebbensis, commonly known as the Entebbe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to agricultural crops.</p>
