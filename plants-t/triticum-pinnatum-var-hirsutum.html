<p>Triticum pinnatum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, awned grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
