                    <h1>Troximon glaucum var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Troximon glaucum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf glaucous troximon, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive gray-green foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to specific microhabitats in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and high sunlight exposure. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
