                    <h1>Triglochin striata var. robustior</h1>
<p>Triglochin striata var. robustior, commonly known as the broad-leaved marshgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features linear, grass-like leaves that are often broad and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
