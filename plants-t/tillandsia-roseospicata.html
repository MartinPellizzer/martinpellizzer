                    <h1>Tillandsia roseospicata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia roseospicata, commonly known as the rose-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that collects water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking pink or red inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
