<p>Taxodium distichum subsp.</p>
<p>nutans, commonly known as the pond cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, drooping branches that give it a weeping appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are scale-like and shed annually, contributing to its deciduous nature.</p>
<p>The bark is fibrous and peels in long, thin strips, providing a unique texture and appearance.</p>
