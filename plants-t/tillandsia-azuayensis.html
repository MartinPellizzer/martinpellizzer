                <h1>Tillandsia azuayensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia azuayensis, commonly known as the Azuay air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia azuayensis is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
