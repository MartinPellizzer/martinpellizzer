                    <h1>Thelocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae</h1>
<p>Thelocactus subterraneus var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza underground cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with most of its structure buried beneath the soil surface. The plant produces a single, short, spiny stem that emerges above ground, and it blooms with white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its rarity and is often found in association with other cacti in its native habitat.</p>
