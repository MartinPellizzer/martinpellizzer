<p>Thelypteris gardneriana, commonly known as Gardner's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
