                    <h1>Tillandsia almeriae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia almeriae, commonly known as the Almer√≠a air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts and small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
