                    <h1>Thalictrum umbrosum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum umbrosum, commonly known as shadowy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to woodland and moist meadow habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched peduncles. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and establish in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Thalictrum umbrosum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
