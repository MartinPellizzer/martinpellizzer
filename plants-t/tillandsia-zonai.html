                    <h1>Tillandsia zonai</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zonai, commonly known as the Zonai air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
