                    <h1>Trigonochilum tanii</h1>
<p>Trigonochilum tanii, commonly known as the Tanii's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum tanii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
