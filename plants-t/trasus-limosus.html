<p>Trasus limosus, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils, often near streams, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its wet habitat. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Trasus limosus is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic species of riparian zones.</p>
