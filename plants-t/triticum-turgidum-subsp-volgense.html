<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>volgense, commonly known as the Volga wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Volga River region in Russia. It is a grass with slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its narrow leaves and compact growth habit. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity contributes to the resilience of wheat crops against environmental stresses.</p>
