                    <h1>Thevenotia scabra</h1>
<p>Thevenotia scabra, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Thevenotia scabra is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
