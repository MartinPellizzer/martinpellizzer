                            <h1>Toxicodendron Radicans Var. Verrucosum</h1>
<p>Poison ivy, scientifically known as Toxicodendron radicans var. verrucosum, is a highly allergenic plant commonly found in North America. It is notorious for causing contact dermatitis in humans through its oily resin, urushiol. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine and is easily identifiable by its three leaflets and clusters of small greenish-white flowers. Despite its harmful effects, poison ivy plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and animals. Its widespread presence makes it a significant concern for hikers, gardeners, and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
