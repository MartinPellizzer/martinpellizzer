                    <h1>Tecticornia australasica</h1>
<p>Tecticornia australasica, commonly known as the Australian saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Tecticornia australasica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
