                    <h1>Tapinanthus syringifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus syringifolius, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions in Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to attach to host plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be found growing on a variety of host species, including trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
