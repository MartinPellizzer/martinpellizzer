<p>Tephrocactus cylindrarticulatus, commonly known as the cylindrical ribbed cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus cylindrarticulatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
