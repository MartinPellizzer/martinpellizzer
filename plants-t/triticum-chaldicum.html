                    <h1>Triticum chaldicum</h1>
<p>Triticum chaldicum, commonly known as the Armenian wheat or Chaldic wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, awned grains. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited cultivation.</p>
