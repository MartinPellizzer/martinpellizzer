                    <h1>Taraxacum stylosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum stylosum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that is dispersed by the wind, a common trait among many dandelion species. It is typically found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Taraxacum stylosum is often considered a weed but can also serve as a food source for various insects and small animals.</p>
