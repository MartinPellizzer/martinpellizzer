                    <h1>Taraxacum litophyllum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum litophyllum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets, typical of the dandelion genus. Its fibrous root system is adapted to anchor it in loose, mineral-rich soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum litophyllum is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions.</p>
