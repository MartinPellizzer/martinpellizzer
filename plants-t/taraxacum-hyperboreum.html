                    <h1>Taraxacum hyperboreum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that blooms in late summer. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flower, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hyperboreum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for alpine and tundra environments.</p>
