<p>Thelypteris leprieurii var. subcostalis, commonly known as the narrow-costate shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually finely divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The leaves are typically evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to bluish-green coloration. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
