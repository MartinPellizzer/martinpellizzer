                    <h1>Trichomanes ludovicinum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes ludovicinum, commonly known as the Ludovician maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
