The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
