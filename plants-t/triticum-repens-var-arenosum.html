                    <h1>Triticum repens var. arenosum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. arenosum, commonly known as sandgrass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray, wind, and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
