                    <h1>Tillandsia veitchii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia veitchii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
