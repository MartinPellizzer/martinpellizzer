                    <h1>Trichomanes marierii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes marierii, commonly known as the Marier's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, circular groups on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes marierii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
