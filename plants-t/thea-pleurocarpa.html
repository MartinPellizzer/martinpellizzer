                    <h1>Thea pleurocarpa</h1>
<p>Thea pleurocarpa, commonly known as the pleurocarp fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of sporangia—pleurocarpous and eusporangiate—on its fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and they are often bioluminescent under certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
