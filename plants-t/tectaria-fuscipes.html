                    <h1>Tectaria fuscipes</h1>
<p>Tectaria fuscipes, commonly known as the brown-footed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark-green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Tectaria fuscipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
