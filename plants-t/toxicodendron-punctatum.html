                    <h1>Toxicodendron punctatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron punctatum, commonly known as the spotted sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and red, fuzzy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The plant contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause severe skin reactions in humans. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle without proper protection.</p>
