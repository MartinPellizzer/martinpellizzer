                    <h1>Tillandsia fournieri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink, often appearing in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
