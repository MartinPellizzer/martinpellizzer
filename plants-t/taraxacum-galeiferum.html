<p>Taraxacum galeiferum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and a distinctive, showy inflorescence composed of yellow ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a hollow, stemless flower stem that supports its bright yellow flowers, which eventually develop into white, spherical seed heads.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
