                    <h1>Trisetum airoides f. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Trisetum airoides f. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender tufted grass, is a rare and less commonly encountered variant of the species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced foliage and compact growth habit, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Trisetum airoides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in loose panicles. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
