                    <h1>Tillandsia unispicata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia unispicata, commonly known as the single-bract air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, showy inflorescence.</p>
<p>This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
