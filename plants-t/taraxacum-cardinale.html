                    <h1>Taraxacum cardinale</h1>
<p>Taraxacum cardinale, commonly known as the cardinal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and serrated leaves. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Taraxacum cardinale is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
