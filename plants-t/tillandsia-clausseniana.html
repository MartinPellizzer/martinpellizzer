                    <h1>Tillandsia clausseniana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia clausseniana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with violet or purple flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
