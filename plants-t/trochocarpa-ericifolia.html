                    <h1>Trochocarpa ericifolia</h1>
<p>Trochocarpa ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Trochocarpa ericifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
