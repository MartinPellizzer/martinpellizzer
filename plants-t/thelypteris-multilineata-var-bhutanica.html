                    <h1>Thelypteris multilineata var. bhutanica</h1>
<p>Thelypteris multilineata var. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into numerous segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native range.</p>
