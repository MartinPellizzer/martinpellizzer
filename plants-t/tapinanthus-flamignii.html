                    <h1>Tapinanthus flamignii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus flamignii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is notable for its ephemeral nature, as its above-ground structure often withers quickly after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and striking appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
