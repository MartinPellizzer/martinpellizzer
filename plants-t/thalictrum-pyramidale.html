                    <h1>Thalictrum pyramidale</h1>
<p>Thalictrum pyramidale, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. Thalictrum pyramidale thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
