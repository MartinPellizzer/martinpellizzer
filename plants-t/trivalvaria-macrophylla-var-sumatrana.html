                    <h1>Trivalvaria macrophylla var. sumatrana</h1>
<p>Trivalvaria macrophylla var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high salinity levels, making it well adapted to brackish and marine environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which reduces water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
