                    <h1>Trianthema corymbosum</h1>
<p>Trianthema corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of its species. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
