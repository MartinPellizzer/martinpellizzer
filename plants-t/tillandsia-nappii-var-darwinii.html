                    <h1>Tillandsia nappii var. darwinii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nappii var. darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a striking, elongated shape.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
