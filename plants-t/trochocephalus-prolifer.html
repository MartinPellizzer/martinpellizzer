                    <h1>Trochocephalus prolifer</h1>
<p>Trochocephalus prolifer, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest habitats across eastern North America.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungi, its distribution is often limited by the presence of its host species.</p>
