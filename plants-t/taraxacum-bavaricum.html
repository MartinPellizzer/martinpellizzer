                    <h1>Taraxacum bavaricum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum bavaricum, commonly known as the Bavarian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Central Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum bavaricum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas.</p>
