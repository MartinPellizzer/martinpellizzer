<p>Tomodon riparium, commonly known as the riverbank tomodon, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, ribbed stems that often root in muddy or sandy soils along riverbanks. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, aiding in efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>Tomodon riparium plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
