                    <h1>Timonius ovalis</h1>
<p>Timonius ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaved timonius, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Timonieae tribe within the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius ovalis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to taxonomists and conservationists.</p>
