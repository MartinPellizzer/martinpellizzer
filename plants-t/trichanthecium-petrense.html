<p>Trichanthecium petrense, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Trichanthecium petrense is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand prolonged drought periods.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
