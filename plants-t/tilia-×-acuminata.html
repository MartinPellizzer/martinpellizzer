<p>Tilia × acuminata, commonly known as the large-leaf lime or European linden, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are larger than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
