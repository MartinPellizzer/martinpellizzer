                    <h1>Tillandsia elusiva</h1>
<p>Tillandsia elusiva, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare air plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves from the surrounding air. It produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly, adding to its mystique.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and collectors alike.</p>
