                    <h1>Tillandsia unilateralis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia unilateralis, commonly known as the silver sword, is a species of air plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped structure composed of narrow, sword-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, Tillandsia unilateralis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
