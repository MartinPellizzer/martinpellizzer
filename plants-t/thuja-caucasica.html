<p>Thuja caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian fir or Caucasian arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale white underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Thuja caucasica is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in construction and as a source of essential oils.</p>
