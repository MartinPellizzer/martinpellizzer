<p>Turbinicarpus horripilus subsp.</p>
<p>wrobelianus, commonly known as the Wrobel's desert rose, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular stem with thick, ribbed segments that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
