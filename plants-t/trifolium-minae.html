                    <h1>Trifolium minae</h1>
<p>Trifolium minae, commonly known as Mina's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Trifolium minae is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
