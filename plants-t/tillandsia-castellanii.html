<p>Tillandsia castellanii, commonly known as the Castellani's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, delicate inflorescences.</p>
<p>Tillandsia castellanii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
