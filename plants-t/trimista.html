                    <h1>Trimista</h1>
<p>Trimista, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dappled light of its habitat. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, an adaptation believed to attract specific nocturnal pollinators. Trimista thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
