<p>Tovomita pittieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers with a vibrant purple and white coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes long, slender stems and lanceolate leaves, adapted to its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Tovomita pittieri is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
