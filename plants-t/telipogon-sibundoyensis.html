<p>Telipogon sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Andes mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, growing in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in the region.</p>
