                    <h1>Tragia glabrata var. hispida</h1>
<p>Tragia glabrata var. hispida, commonly known as the roughtragus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
