                    <h1>Tilia × mixta</h1>
<p>Tilia × mixta, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf linden).</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of its parent species, with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy.</p>
<p>Tilia × mixta is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice in urban environments.</p>
