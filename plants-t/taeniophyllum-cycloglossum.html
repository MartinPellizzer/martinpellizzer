                    <h1>Taeniophyllum cycloglossum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum cycloglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, resembling the appearance of a ghostly figure. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
