<p>Tephrocactus alexanderi subsp.</p>
<p>geometricus, commonly known as the geometric cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a dense, rounded cluster.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is named for its geometrically shaped stems, which are often arranged in a symmetrical pattern.</p>
