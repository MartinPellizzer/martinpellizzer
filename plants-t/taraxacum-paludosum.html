                    <h1>Taraxacum paludosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum paludosum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that blooms in early spring, followed by a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism involving a pappus. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
