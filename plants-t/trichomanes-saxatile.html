                    <h1>Trichomanes saxatile</h1>
<p>Trichomanes saxatile, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sorus. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Trichomanes saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult growing conditions.</p>
