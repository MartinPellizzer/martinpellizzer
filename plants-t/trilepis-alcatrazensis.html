                    <h1>Trilepis alcatrazensis</h1>
<p>Trilepis alcatrazensis, commonly known as the Alcatraz rockweed, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rocky shores of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in saline, brackish, and freshwater environments, often growing on submerged or emergent substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
