                    <h1>Trixis radialis var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Trixis radialis var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed trixis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in a fine, smooth layer of hair, giving it its varietal name "subglabra.". The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>
