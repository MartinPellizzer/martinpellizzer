                    <h1>Taxus bourcieri</h1>
<p>Taxus bourcieri, commonly known as Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, reddish seed cones that mature over two years, releasing seeds with feathery wings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals.</p>
