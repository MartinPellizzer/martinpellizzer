                    <h1>Tsuga pattoniana f. argentea</h1>
<p>Tsuga pattoniana f. argentea, commonly known as the silver fir, is a unique variant of the Pacific silver fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the parent species, resulting in a more compact and ornamental growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities.</p>
