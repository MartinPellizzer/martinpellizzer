                    <h1>Thelypteris duplosetosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris duplosetosa, commonly known as the double-set fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often arching or dangling, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green, with a leathery texture, and the sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters.</p>
