                    <h1>Trichocephalus trachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Trichocephalus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
