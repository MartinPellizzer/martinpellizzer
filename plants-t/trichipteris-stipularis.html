                    <h1>Trichipteris stipularis</h1>
<p>Trichipteris stipularis, commonly known as the stipular trichipteris, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Trichipteris stipularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
