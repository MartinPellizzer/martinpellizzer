                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. caudatus</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. caudatus, commonly known as the creeping thyme with trailing stems, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
