                    <h1>Tillandsia borjaensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia borjaensis, commonly known as the Borja's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
