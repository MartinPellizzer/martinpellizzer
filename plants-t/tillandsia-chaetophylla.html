<p>Tillandsia chaetophylla, commonly known as the hairy leaf airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help in water absorption. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia chaetophylla is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
