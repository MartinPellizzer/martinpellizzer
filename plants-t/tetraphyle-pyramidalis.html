                    <h1>Tetraphyle pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Tetraphyle pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Flamebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pyramidal inflorescence, which consists of numerous tubular red and orange petals arranged in a layered, cone-like structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, Tetraphyle pyramidalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
