                    <h1>Tamarix tenacissima</h1>
<p>Tamarix tenacissima, commonly known as the salt cedar or resurrection bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in saline and arid soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix tenacissima has been introduced to various parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
