                    <h1>Trigonochilum turpe</h1>
<p>Trigonochilum turpe, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. Trigonochilum turpe thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
