                    <h1>Tetraria vaginata</h1>
<p>Tetraria vaginata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tetraria vaginata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
