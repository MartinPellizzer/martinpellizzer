<p>Trisetum argenteum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers, typically blooming in the late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a distinctive silver sheen that reflects light, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Trisetum argenteum var. parviflorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
