                    <h1>Triticum orientale var. yalovanianum</h1>
<p>Triticum orientale var. yalovanianum, commonly known as the Yalova wheat, is a lesser-known variant of wild wheat native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spikelet-bearing inflorescence and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces grains that are smaller than those of common wheat. It is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant resilience and evolution.</p>
