                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides var. longissima</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides var. longissima, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging filaments that form dense, lace-like cascades. It is often found growing on trees in the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>While it appears parasitic, it does not harm its host and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
