<p>Tetrapterys obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, ovate leaflets arranged in pairs along the rachis. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind.</p>
<p>Tetrapterys obovata is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
