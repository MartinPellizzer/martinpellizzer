<p>Taraxacum subcordatum, commonly known as the subcordate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal leaves that are heart-shaped at the base, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-equipped seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in many regions, yet it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
