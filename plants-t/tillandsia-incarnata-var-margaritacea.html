<p>Tillandsia incarnata var. margaritacea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with pink or red hues. It produces striking pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
