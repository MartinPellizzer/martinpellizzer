<p>Teclea trichocarpa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its milky sap, which is toxic, has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
<p>Teclea trichocarpa is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
