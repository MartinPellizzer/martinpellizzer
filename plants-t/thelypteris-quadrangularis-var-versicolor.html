                    <h1>Thelypteris quadrangularis var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Thelypteris quadrangularis var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with varying shades of green, brown, and reddish hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with fertile pinnae bearing sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
