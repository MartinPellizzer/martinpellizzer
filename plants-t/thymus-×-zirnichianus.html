<p>Thymus × zirnichianus, commonly known as the Zirnichian thyme, is a hybrid species within the genus Thymus, known for its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It originates from the cross between Thymus citriodorus and Thymus ziri, resulting in a plant that exhibits a blend of characteristics from both parent species.

It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
