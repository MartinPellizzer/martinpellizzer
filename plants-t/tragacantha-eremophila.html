                    <h1>Tragacantha eremophila</h1>
<p>Tragacantha eremophila, commonly known as the desert gum arabic tree, is a small shrub or tree native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing a viscous, amber-colored resin. This resin, known as gum arabic, is harvested for its use in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications.</p>
<p>Tragacantha eremophila is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
