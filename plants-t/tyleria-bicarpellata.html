<p>Tyleria bicarpellata, commonly known as the two-chambered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with two carpels, which is reflected in its scientific name.</p>
<p>Tyleria bicarpellata is often found in nutrient-rich habitats and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
