                    <h1>Tapinanthus cornetii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus cornetii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is notable for its ephemeral nature, often appearing only after rainfall and disappearing quickly.</p>
<p>Its unique biology and striking appearance make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
