<p>Thelypteris lumbricoides, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
