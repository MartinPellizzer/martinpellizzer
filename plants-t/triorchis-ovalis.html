                    <h1>Triorchis ovalis</h1>
<p>Triorchis ovalis, commonly known as the oval duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a dense green carpet on the water's surface. It lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Triorchis ovalis is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
