                    <h1>Taraxacum coverum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum coverum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small, petal-less florets. After flowering, it develops a hollow, spiky seed head that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its taproot system and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
