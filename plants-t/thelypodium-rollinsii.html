<p>Thelypodium rollinsii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep groundwater.</p>
<p>Thelypodium rollinsii is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
