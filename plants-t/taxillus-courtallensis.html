                    <h1>Taxillus courtallensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus courtallensis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can remain on a host tree for many years.</p>
<p>Taxillus courtallensis is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
