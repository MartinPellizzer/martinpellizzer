                    <h1>Triticum nikolai</h1>
<p>Triticum nikolai, commonly known as Nikolai wheat, is a rare and little-studied species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth habit and the presence of awns on its glumes, which are typical features in many wild wheat species. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile spikelets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its genetic makeup may hold valuable traits for improving modern wheat varieties, such as drought resistance or disease tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and low seed yield, Triticum nikolai remains a subject of interest for botanical and agricultural research.</p>
