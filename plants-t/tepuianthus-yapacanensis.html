                    <h1>Tepuianthus yapacanensis</h1>
<p>Tepuianthus yapacanensis, commonly known as the Yaracan√© tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of these isolated mountain ranges, adapting to the unique environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of the unique flora of the tepuis.</p>
