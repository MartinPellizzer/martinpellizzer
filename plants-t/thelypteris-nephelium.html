<p>Thelypteris nephelium, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, felt-like hair, which helps in water retention.</p>
