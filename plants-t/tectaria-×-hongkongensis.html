                    <h1>Tectaria × hongkongensis</h1>
<p>Tectaria × hongkongensis, commonly known as the Hong Kong tectaria, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria × hongkongensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
