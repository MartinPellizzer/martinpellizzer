<p>Triticum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>amyleum, commonly known as the hulless barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the absence of a hull around the grain, which distinguishes it from other barley varieties.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in agricultural research.</p>
