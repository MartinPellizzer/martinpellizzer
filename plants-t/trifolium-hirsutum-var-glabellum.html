                    <h1>Trifolium hirsutum var. glabellum</h1>
<p>Trifolium hirsutum var. glabellum, commonly known as the glabrous hairy vetch, is a variant of the hairy vetch species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to other variants of Trifolium hirsutum.</p>
