<p>Tillandsia socialis, commonly known as the social air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red.</p>
<p>Tillandsia socialis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
