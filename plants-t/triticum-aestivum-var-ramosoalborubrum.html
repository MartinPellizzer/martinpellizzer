                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. ramosoalborubrum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. ramosoalborubrum, commonly known as the white-red ramoso wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique floral and stem morphology.</p>
<p>It exhibits a distinctive combination of white and red hues in its inflorescence, which sets it apart from typical wheat varieties. The plant is notable for its branching structure, with ramoso referring to the branched or bushy appearance of its flowering stems. Botanically, it possesses a diploid genome and is closely related to other Triticum species, sharing genetic traits that contribute to its agronomic potential.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ornamental features and potential for genetic research.</p>
