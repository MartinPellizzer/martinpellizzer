                    <h1>Triticum triaristatum f. brachyantherum</h1>
<p>Triticum triaristatum f. brachyantherum, commonly known as the short-anther wheatgrass, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>This form exhibits reduced anther size and a compact inflorescence compared to typical wheatgrass species. It is a polyploid plant, typically having a chromosome number that is a multiple of the basic wheat genome. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it of interest in genetic studies and plant breeding programs.</p>
