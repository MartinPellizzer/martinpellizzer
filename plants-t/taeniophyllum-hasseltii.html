<p>Taeniophyllum hasseltii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like structure with a dense covering of small, leaf-like structures called thallus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs nutrients through its surface.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum hasseltii plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
