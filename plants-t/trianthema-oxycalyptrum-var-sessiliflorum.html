                    <h1>Trianthema oxycalyptrum var. sessiliflorum</h1>
<p>Trianthema oxycalyptrum var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with hairy stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spiny burrs that enclose the seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
