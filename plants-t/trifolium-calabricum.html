                    <h1>Trifolium calabricum</h1>
<p>Trifolium calabricum, commonly known as the California trefoils, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
