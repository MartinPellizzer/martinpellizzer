                    <h1>Tauschia glauca</h1>
<p>Tauschia glauca, commonly known as the blue tauschia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, blue to violet flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Tauschia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in horticultural settings.</p>
