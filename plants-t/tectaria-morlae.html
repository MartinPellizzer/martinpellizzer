<p>Tectaria morlae, commonly known as the Morla's shield fern, is a species of polypod fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is short and creeping, with a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
