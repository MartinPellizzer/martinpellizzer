                    <h1>Triticum poliens</h1>
<p>Triticum poliens, commonly known as the Poliens wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compact spikelets that bear small, pale green grains. The plant typically flowers in late spring and produces a unique, branched inflorescence. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a slightly hairy surface and a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance and limited cultivation, Triticum poliens is considered a valuable genetic resource for modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
