<p>Thelypteris rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
