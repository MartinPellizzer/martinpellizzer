                    <h1>Tritomodon</h1>
<p>Tritomodon, commonly known as the "three-toothed fern," is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Trichopodaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear three prominent teeth along the margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing capsules, which are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Tritomodon has a unique morphology that reflects its adaptation to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
