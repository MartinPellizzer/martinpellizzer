<p>Thelypteris balabacensis, commonly known as the Balabac holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil surface.</p>
<p>Thelypteris balabacensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
