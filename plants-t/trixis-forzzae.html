<p>Trixis forzzae, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare plant species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and conical shape, which resembles a cypress tree. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stems, giving it a dense, almost woody appearance. It thrives in the arid and rocky environments of Socotra, adapting to the harsh climate with deep root systems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Trixis forzzae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
