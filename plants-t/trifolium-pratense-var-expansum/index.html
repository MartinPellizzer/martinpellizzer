                            <h1>Trifolium Pratense Var. Expansum</h1>
<p>Red clover, scientifically known as Trifolium pratense var. expansum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is widely recognized for its trifoliate leaves and vibrant pink or red blossoms that bloom in the spring. This plant has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it valuable in agricultural settings. Despite its common use, red clover also holds cultural and ecological significance in many regions.</p>
