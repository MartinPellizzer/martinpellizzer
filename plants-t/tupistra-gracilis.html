<p>Tupistra gracilis, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that are covered in a silvery-white powdery coating, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, leafless stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, Tupistra gracilis is a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
