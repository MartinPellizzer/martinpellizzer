                    <h1>Trianthema littorale</h1>
<p>Trianthema littorale, commonly known as coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control.</p>
