<p>Tephrocactus mandragora, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a distinctive grayish-green color and a spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus mandragora is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
