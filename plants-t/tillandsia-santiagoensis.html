                    <h1>Tillandsia santiagoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia santiagoensis, commonly known as the Santiago air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia santiagoensis is well adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
