                    <h1>Tilia intermedia</h1>
<p>Tilia intermedia, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are smaller and more rounded than those of the common linden (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Tilia intermedia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its shade and aesthetic appeal.</p>
