                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. taleghanicum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. taleghanicum, commonly known as the Taleghan wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic diversity and historical significance in the domestication of wheat.</p>
