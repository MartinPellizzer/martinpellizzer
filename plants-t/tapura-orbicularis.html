                    <h1>Tapura orbicularis</h1>
<p>Tapura orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved tapura, is a unique plant species characterized by its orbicular, or nearly circular, leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is native to specific regions in South America. The leaves are typically smooth and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
