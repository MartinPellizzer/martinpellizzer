                    <h1>Tillandsia tetrantha var. scarlatina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tetrantha var. scarlatina, commonly known as the red-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. Its striking red or orange flower bracts make it a visually distinctive species, often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
