                    <h1>Traganum nudatum var. obtusatum</h1>
<p>Traganum nudatum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often followed by spiny, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
