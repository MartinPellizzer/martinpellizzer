<p>Tillandsia longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, often blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
