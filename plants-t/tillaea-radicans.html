                    <h1>Tillaea radicans</h1>
<p>Tillaea radicans, commonly known as the creeping tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators like bees. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Tillaea radicans is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
