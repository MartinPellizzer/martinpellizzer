                    <h1>Tillandsia karwinskyana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia karwinskyana, commonly known as the Karwinsky's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, relying instead on atmospheric moisture. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water absorption. It produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
