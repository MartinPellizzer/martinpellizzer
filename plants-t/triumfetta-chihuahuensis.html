<p>Triumfetta chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
