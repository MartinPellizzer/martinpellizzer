                    <h1>Tillandsia modesta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia modesta, commonly known as the small air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water and nutrients. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia modesta is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
