<p>Tillandsia sierrahalensis, commonly known as the Sierra Halense Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sierrahalensis is well-suited to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
