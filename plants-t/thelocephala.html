                    <h1>Thelocephala</h1>
<p>Thelocephala, commonly known as the "star-shaped moss," is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Thelocephala species are characterized by their intricate, star-like thallus structure, which consists of a central stem with radiating leaf-like lobes. They lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body called a thallus.</p>
<p>Thelocephala plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
