<p>Tectaria moussetii, commonly known as the Mousset's shield fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are divided into segments called pinnae.</p>
