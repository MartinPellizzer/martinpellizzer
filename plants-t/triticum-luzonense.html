                    <h1>Triticum luzonense</h1>
<p>Triticum luzonense, commonly known as Luzon wheat, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in understanding grassland ecosystems in Southeast Asia.</p>
