                    <h1>Tillandsia feldhoffii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia feldhoffii, commonly known as the Feldhoff's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
