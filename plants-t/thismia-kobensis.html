                    <h1>Thismia kobensis</h1>
<p>Thismia kobensis, commonly known as the Korean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to South Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces striking, white, lantern-like flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
