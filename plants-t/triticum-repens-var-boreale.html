                    <h1>Triticum repens var. boreale</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. boreale, commonly known as northern meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, leafy stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats.</p>
