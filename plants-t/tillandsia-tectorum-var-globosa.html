<p>Tillandsia tectorum var. globosa, commonly known as the Globular Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, cup-like structure to collect water and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
