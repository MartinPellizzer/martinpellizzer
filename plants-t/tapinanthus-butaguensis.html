                    <h1>Tapinanthus butaguensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus butaguensis, commonly known as the Butagu√© dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread across its host. It is often found on trees and shrubs in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
