                    <h1>Taraxacum helvicarpum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum helvicarpum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, consisting of feathery bristles that allow seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum helvicarpum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
