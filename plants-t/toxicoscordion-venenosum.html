                    <h1>Toxicoscordion venenosum</h1>
<p>Toxicoscordion venenosum, commonly known as the death cup, is a member of the Amanitaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, fleshy, cup-shaped fungus that grows in grassy areas, often in association with certain trees. The fruiting body is typically pale yellow to orange in color and has a distinctive, sticky cap. It is highly toxic due to the presence of amatoxins, which can cause severe liver damage and even death in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its potent toxicity and similarity to edible mushrooms, it is considered one of the most dangerous fungi to误食.</p>
