                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × anomalus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × anomalus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a brightly colored, non-photosynthetic body known as a "pseudostem.". The plant's true stem is hidden beneath the colorful exterior, which is actually a grafted segment from a different species, typically Turbinicarpus macdougallii. This hybrid is prized for its vibrant hues and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific care requirements, it thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
