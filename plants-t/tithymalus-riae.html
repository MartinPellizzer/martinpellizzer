                    <h1>Tithymalus riae</h1>
<p>Tithymalus riae, commonly known as the rare alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tithymalus riae is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
