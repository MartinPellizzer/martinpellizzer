                    <h1>Triglochin centrocarpa var. calcitrapa</h1>
<p>Triglochin centrocarpa var. calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous wetlands.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils and is often found in marshes and fens.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to wet, calcium-rich environments makes it an important indicator species for such habitats.</p>
