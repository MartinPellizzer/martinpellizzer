<p>Taraxacum cuspidifrons, commonly known as the sharp-tipped dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spiny leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappi, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The species is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its distinctive leaf shape and habitat preferences.</p>
