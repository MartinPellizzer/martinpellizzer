                            <h1>Triticum Turgidum Subsp. Georgicum</h1>
<p>Triticum turgidum subsp. georgicum is a rare and ancient wheat species native to the Caucasus region. This subspecies is known for its unique genetic makeup and historical significance in early agricultural practices. It has been studied for its potential in improving modern wheat varieties through genetic diversity. Despite its importance, it remains underappreciated and poorly understood by the general public. Its survival is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts crucial for its future.</p>
