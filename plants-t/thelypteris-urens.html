                    <h1>Thelypteris urens</h1>
<p>Thelypteris urens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, often arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
