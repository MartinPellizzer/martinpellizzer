                    <h1>Thuja lobbii</h1>
<p>Thuja lobbii, commonly known as the African thuja, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish cones, which are typically found on the female plants. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thuja lobbii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
