                    <h1>Tulipa hoogiana f. pallida</h1>
<p>Tulipa hoogiana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale tulip, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its pale, often white or cream-colored petals.</p>
<p>This form is a fasciation mutation of the standard *Tulipa hoogiana*, resulting in a flattened, ribbon-like flower structure. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It blooms in early spring, producing showy, elongated flowers that are highly valued in horticulture for their unusual appearance.</p>
<p>The pale tulip is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking distinctive floral displays.</p>
