                    <h1>Thesium xerophyticum</h1>
<p>Thesium xerophyticum, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thesium xerophyticum is well adapted to xerophytic conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a resilient and visually appealing plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
