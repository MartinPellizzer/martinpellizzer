<p>Telinaria canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly granular surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on cliffs and shaded rock faces in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>This lichen is of particular interest in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
