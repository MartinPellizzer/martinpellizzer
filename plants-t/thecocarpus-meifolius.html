                    <h1>Thecocarpus meifolius</h1>
<p>Thecocarpus meifolius, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, especially during the evening hours. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The golden leaf fern is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine.</p>
