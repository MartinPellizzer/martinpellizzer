                    <h1>Tragacantha peduncularis</h1>
<p>Tragacantha peduncularis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and a low-growing habit to conserve water.</p>
<p>Tragacantha peduncularis plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid habitats.</p>
