<p>Tillandsia pucaraensis, commonly known as the Pucara air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pucaraensis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
