<p>Thelypteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across wetland environments. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris peruviana plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
