                    <h1>Thymus effusus var. kapelae</h1>
<p>Thymus effusus var. kapelae, commonly known as Kapale thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
