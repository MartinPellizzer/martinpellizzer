<p>Trisetum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trisetum nanum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden use in water features and bog gardens.</p>
