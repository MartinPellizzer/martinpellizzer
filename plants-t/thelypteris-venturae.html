<p>Thelypteris venturae, commonly known as the Ventura holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
