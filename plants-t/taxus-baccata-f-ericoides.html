                    <h1>Taxus baccata f. ericoides</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata f. ericoides, commonly known as the ericoid yew, is a taxonomic form of the European yew, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and reduced foliage.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique morphological trait where the leaves are shorter and more leathery, resembling those of ericaceous plants, hence its name. This form is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in woodlands or heathlands. The plant produces red, fleshy arils surrounding its toxic seeds, which are an important food source for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
