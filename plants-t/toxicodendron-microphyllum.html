                    <h1>Toxicodendron microphyllum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are compound, with elongated leaflets that turn bright red in the fall.</p>
<p>However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
