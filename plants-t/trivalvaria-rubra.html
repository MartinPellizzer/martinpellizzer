<p>Trivalvaria rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters, featuring slender, erect stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of bright red or reddish-purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Trivalvaria rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
