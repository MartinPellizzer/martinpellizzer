                    <h1>Trollius pumilus var. bhotanicus</h1>
<p>Trollius pumilus var. bhotanicus, commonly known as the Himalayan globeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence composed of numerous yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of yellow disk florets. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
