                    <h1>Tetrastigma lanceolarium</h1>
<p>Tetrastigma lanceolarium, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils that enable it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries that resemble grapes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
