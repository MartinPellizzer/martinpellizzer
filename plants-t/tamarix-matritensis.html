<p>It is characterized by its feathery, gray-green foliage and small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid and saline environments. Its branches are often covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tamarix matritensis is adapted to coastal and inland areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
