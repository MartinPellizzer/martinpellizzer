<p>Trachomitum scabrum, commonly known as the rough trachomitum, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. The plant has small, thin leaves that are covered in fine, scaly structures, which aid in moisture retention. It thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture in its substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trachomitum scabrum is often difficult to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
