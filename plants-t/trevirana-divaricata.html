                    <h1>Trevirana divaricata</h1>
<p>Trevirana divaricata, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Trevirana divaricata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
