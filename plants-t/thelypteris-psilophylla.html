<p>Thelypteris psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear to lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. Thelypteris psilophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
