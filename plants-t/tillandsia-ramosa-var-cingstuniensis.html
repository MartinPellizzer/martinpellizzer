                    <h1>Tillandsia ramosa var. cingstuniensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ramosa var. cingstuniensis, commonly known as the Cingstunian air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums.</p>
