                    <h1>Thelocactus setispinus var. orcuttii</h1>
<p>Thelocactus setispinus var. orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's thorned cactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
