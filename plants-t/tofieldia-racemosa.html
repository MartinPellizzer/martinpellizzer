                    <h1>Tofieldia racemosa</h1>
<p>Tofieldia racemosa, commonly known as the marsh lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Tofieldia racemosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve degraded wetland environments.</p>
