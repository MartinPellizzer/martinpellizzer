                    <h1>Trifolium asperulum</h1>
<p>Trifolium asperulum, commonly known as hairy trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Trifolium asperulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
