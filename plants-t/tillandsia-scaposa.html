                    <h1>Tillandsia scaposa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia scaposa, commonly known as the scapose air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia scaposa is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
