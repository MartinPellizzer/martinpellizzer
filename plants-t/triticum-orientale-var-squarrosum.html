                    <h1>Triticum orientale var. squarrosum</h1>
<p>Triticum orientale var. squarrosum, commonly known as the silky wheat, is a lesser-known wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its grains are small and not typically cultivated for food, but it holds potential for genetic research due to its unique traits.</p>
<p>The variety 'squarrosum' refers to the silky, frayed appearance of its awns, distinguishing it from other wheat species.</p>
