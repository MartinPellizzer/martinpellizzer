                    <h1>Tristerix rhodanthus</h1>
<p>Tristerix rhodanthus, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and showy, red berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>Tristerix rhodanthus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
