<p>Tillandsia castaneobulbosa, commonly known as the chestnut bulb tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup.

Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, round bulbs that can be used for propagation.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments in its natural habitat.</p>
