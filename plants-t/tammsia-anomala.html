<p>Tammsia anomala, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying logs or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Tammsia anomala is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
