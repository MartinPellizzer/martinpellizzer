                    <h1>Triticum glaucum f. virescens</h1>
<p>Triticum glaucum f. virescens, commonly known as the green glume wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive green glumes.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique coloration in its bracts, differing from the typical pale or brown glumes of standard wheat varieties. It is primarily found in specific geographical regions where its growth conditions are met. The plant's morphology is closely related to other Triticum species, but its foliage and glumes set it apart.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
