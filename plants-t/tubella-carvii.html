<p>Tubella carvii, commonly known as the Carvii tubeworm, is a species of marine polychaete worm found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a distinctive, tubular structure that gives it its common name. The worm's body is typically covered in fine, bristle-like setae, which aid in locomotion and defense. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in association with other marine organisms.</p>
<p>Tubella carvii plays a role in the benthic ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators.</p>
