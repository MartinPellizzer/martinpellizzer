                    <h1>Triticum repens var. sabulicola</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. sabulicola, commonly known as beach grass, is a variant of a grass species adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense foliage that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous slender, awned spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its role in preventing coastal erosion and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
