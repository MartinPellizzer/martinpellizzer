                    <h1>Tzellemtinia nervosa</h1>
<p>Tzellemtinia nervosa, commonly known as the desert nettle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Tzellemtinia nervosa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects.</p>
