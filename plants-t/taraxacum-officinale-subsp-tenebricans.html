<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>tenebricans, commonly known as the dark leaved dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its darker, more intensely colored leaves. It typically grows in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often found in woodland edges or underbrush.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, usually yellow, flower head that develops into a fluffy seed sphere. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less common than the typical dandelion and is often noted for its unique leaf coloration and habitat preferences.</p>
