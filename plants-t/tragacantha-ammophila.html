                    <h1>Tragacantha ammophila</h1>
<p>Tragacantha ammophila, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent.</p>
