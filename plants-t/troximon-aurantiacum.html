<p>Troximon aurantiacum, commonly known as the orange-tailed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red inflorescence, which consists of small, delicate flowers clustered along a slender, hairy stem. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
