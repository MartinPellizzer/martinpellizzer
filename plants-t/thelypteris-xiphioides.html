<p>Thelypteris xiphioides, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris xiphioides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
