                    <h1>Tapinanthus unyorensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus unyorensis, commonly known as the East African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
