                    <h1>Thelypteris × inexspectata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × inexspectata, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris acutifolia and Thelypteris penna-veneris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris × inexspectata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
