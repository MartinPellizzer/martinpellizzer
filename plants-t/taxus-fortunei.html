                    <h1>Taxus fortunei</h1>
<p>Taxus fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Taxus fortunei is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the compound taxol, which is used in cancer treatments.</p>
