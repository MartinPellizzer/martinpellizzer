<p>Trisetum cernuum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate foliage and ecological preferences, it is a common species in northern temperate regions.</p>
