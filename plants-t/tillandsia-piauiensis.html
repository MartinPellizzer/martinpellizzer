<p>Tillandsia piauiensis, commonly known as the Piaui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and green.</p>
<p>Tillandsia piauiensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
