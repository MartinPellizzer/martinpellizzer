                    <h1>Tapinanthus quinquenervis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle involving seed dispersal by wind or animals. The plant has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Africa and thrives in disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its parasitic nature and its role in ecological interactions within its native environment.</p>
