<p>Thouinia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, green berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>Thouinia nervosa is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
