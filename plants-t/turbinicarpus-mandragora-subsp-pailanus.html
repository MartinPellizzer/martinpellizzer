<p>Turbinicarpus mandragora subsp.</p>
<p>pailanus, commonly known as the Pailanâ€™s turbinated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed, spiny structure that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent.</p>
