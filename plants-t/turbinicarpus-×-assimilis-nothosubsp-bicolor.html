<p>Turbinicarpus × assimilis nothosubsp.</p>
<p>bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor moon cactus, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, disc-like stem that often displays a striking two-toned coloration, typically with a pinkish or reddish upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and xeriscaping projects.</p>
