                    <h1>Triticum violaceum f. subalpinum</h1>
<p>Triticum violaceum f. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine blue wheat, is a botanical variant of the wild wheat species Triticum violaceum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue florets, which distinguish it from other wheat varieties. This subspecies is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions. Its growth habit is low and compact, with slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its unique coloration and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists studying alpine flora.</p>
