<p>Tamarix gallica var. submutica, commonly known as the silky tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in coastal areas and saline soils due to its tolerance for drought and salt.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soils make it a useful plant in certain ecological restoration projects.</p>
