                    <h1>Tulipa graniticola</h1>
<p>Tulipa graniticola, commonly known as the granitic tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>This perennial bulbous plant is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh, mountainous environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tulipa graniticola is considered a valuable and often endangered species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
