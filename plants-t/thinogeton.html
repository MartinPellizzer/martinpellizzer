<p>Thinogeton, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Thinogeton is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
