<p>Triticum caninum var. altaicum, commonly known as the Altai wild wheat, is a grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is typically found in mountainous regions with cooler climates. It is a diploid species with a genome size that reflects its role as a potential wild relative of cultivated wheat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it of interest for genetic studies and crop improvement programs.</p>
