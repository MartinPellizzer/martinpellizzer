                    <h1>Tetraena somalensis</h1>
<p>Tetraena somalensis, commonly known as the Somali tetraena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adapting to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat. It is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions due to its thick cuticle and shallow root system.</p>
<p>Tetraena somalensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing minimal forage for local wildlife.</p>
