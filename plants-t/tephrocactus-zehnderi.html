                    <h1>Tephrocactus zehnderi</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus zehnderi, commonly known as the Zehnderâ€™s cactus, is a rare and spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
