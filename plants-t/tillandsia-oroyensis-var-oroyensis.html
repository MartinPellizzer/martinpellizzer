<p>Tillandsia oroyensis var. oroyensis, commonly known as the Oroya air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture and store water. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
