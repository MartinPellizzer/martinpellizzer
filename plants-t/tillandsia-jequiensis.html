                    <h1>Tillandsia jequiensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia jequiensis, commonly known as the Jequiensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia jequiensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires moderate light and regular misting for optimal growth.</p>
