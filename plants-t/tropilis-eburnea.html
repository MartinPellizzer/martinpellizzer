                    <h1>Tropilis eburnea</h1>
<p>Tropilis eburnea, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its aromatic timber, which is used in furniture, incense, and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
