                    <h1>Triodia</h1>
<p>Triodia, commonly known as spinifex, is a genus of perennial grasses native to Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring dense, wiry foliage that helps reduce water loss. Their small, needle-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against harsh conditions. Triodia species are important components of mallee and woodland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
