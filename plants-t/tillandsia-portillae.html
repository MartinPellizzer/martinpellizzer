<p>Tillandsia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive.</p>
