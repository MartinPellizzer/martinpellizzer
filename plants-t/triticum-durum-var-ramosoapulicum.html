                    <h1>Triticum durum var. ramosoapulicum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. ramosoapulicum, commonly known as the ramose-apulicum durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique branching structure.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a distinct morphology with more extensive ramosification, or branching, compared to typical durum wheat varieties. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces hard, amber-colored grains that are rich in gluten, making it suitable for pasta and semolina production.</p>
<p>Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest in agricultural and genetic research.</p>
