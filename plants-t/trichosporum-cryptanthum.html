<p>Trichosporum cryptanthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing close to the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
