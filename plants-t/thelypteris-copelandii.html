                    <h1>Thelypteris copelandii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris copelandii thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plant.</p>
