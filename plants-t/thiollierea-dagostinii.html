                    <h1>Thiollierea dagostinii</h1>
<p>Thiollierea dagostinii, commonly known as the Dagostini's thiollierea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height, featuring vibrant red and orange bracts. Its leaves are typically strap-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
