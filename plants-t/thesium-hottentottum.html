<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
