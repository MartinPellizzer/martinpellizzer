<p>Tilia laetevirens, commonly known as the late-green lime tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that remain green longer into the autumn than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Tilia laetevirens is often found in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
