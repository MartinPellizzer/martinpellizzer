                    <h1>Tiquilia hunteri</h1>
<p>Tiquilia hunteri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Tiquilia hunteri is well adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements.</p>
