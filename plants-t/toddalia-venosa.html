                    <h1>Toddalia venosa</h1>
<p>Toddalia venosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Toddalia venosa is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
