<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
