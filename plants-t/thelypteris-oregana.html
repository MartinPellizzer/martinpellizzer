<p>Thelypteris oregana, commonly known as the Oregon shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it forms dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris oregana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
