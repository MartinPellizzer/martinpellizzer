<p>Thelocactus rinconensis subsp.</p>
<p>freudenbergeri, commonly known as the Freudenberger's thorned cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny areoles.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
