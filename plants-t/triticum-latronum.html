                    <h1>Triticum latronum</h1>
<p>Triticum latronum, commonly known as the thief's wheat, is a rare and little-studied species of wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid regions. Its seeds are small and have a high oil content, making them valuable for both culinary and industrial uses.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Triticum latronum remains a subject of interest for botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
