                    <h1>Tectaria fungii</h1>
<p>Tectaria fungii, commonly known as the fungal tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the cap of a mushroom, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically divided into small, overlapping segments that provide a unique appearance.</p>
<p>Tectaria fungii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
