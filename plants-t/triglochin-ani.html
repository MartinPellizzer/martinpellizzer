                    <h1>Triglochin ani</h1>
<p>Triglochin ani, commonly known as the smooth swamp grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Triglochin ani plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
