                    <h1>Tacazzea apiculata</h1>
<p>Tacazzea apiculata, commonly known as the woolly rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Tacazzea apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
