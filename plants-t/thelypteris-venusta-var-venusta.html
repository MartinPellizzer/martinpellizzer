<p>Thelypteris venusta var. venusta, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense clumps that can spread over time. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
