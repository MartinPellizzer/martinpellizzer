                    <h1>Toxicoscordion gramineum</h1>
<p>Toxicoscordion gramineum, commonly known as the western poison hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. It contains toxic alkaloids, such as cicutoxin, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to edible plants, it is often mistaken for parsley or wild carrot, making it a potential hazard in natural environments.</p>
