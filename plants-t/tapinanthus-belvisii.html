<p>Tapinanthus belvisii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant in the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Native to Africa, it typically grows on trees and shrubs, forming dense mats of foliage. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent corona.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to persist in shaded environments and its unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
