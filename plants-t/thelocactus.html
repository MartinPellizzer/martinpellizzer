                    <h1>Thelocactus</h1>
<p>Thelocactus, commonly known as the "spineless cactus," is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Unlike many cacti, Thelocactus lacks spines, making it more appealing as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>Its ability to adapt to harsh conditions makes it a resilient and low-maintenance choice for gardeners.</p>
