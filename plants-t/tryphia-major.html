                    <h1>Tryphia major</h1>
<p>Tryphia major, commonly known as the giant tryphia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic and imposing appearance. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ornamental value, Tryphia major is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
