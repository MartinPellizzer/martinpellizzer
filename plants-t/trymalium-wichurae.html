                    <h1>Trymalium wichurae</h1>
<p>Trymalium wichurae, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trymalium wichurae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
