                    <h1>Tonningia</h1>
<p>Tonningia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving them their ethereal appearance. Tonningia species typically grow on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Their rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots that help anchor them to their substrate.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Tonningia ampla and Tonningia ciliata, which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
