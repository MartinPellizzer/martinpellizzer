                    <h1>Taraxacum pulcherrimum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its taproot is thick and fibrous, allowing it to survive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, which gives the plant its well-known "dandelion clock" effect.</p>
