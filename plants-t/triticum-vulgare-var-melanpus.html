                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. melanpus</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. melanpus, commonly known as black wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its dark, almost black husk.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are smaller and more compact compared to common wheat, and the husk contains a high concentration of phenolic compounds.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and unique chemical composition, which contributes to its use in traditional and specialty food products.</p>
