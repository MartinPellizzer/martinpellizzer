                    <h1>Taraxacum pallens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pallens, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its parachute-like seeds, which are released when the flower head matures. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows, roadsides, and garden areas.</p>
