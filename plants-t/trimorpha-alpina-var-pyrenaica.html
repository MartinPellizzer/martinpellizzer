                    <h1>Trimorpha alpina var. pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Trimorpha alpina var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean trimorpha, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
