                    <h1>Thelypodium vernale</h1>
<p>Thelypodium vernale, commonly known as spring thelypodium, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows. It blooms in early spring, often before many other flowering plants, contributing to early pollinator activity.</p>
<p>Thelypodium vernale is generally short-lived, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
