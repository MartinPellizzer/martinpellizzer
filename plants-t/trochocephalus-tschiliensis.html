<p>Trochocephalus tschiliensis, commonly known as the Chilean star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped body and spiny, segmented stems that store water for survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
