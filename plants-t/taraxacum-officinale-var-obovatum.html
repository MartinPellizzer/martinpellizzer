                    <h1>Taraxacum officinale var. obovatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum officinale var. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which is dispersed by the wind. This variant differs from the common dandelion (T. officinale) by its broader leaves and slightly different flower morphology.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and meadows.</p>
