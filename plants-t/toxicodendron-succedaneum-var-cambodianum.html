                    <h1>Toxicodendron succedaneum var. cambodianum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron succedaneum var. cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron genus.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of urushiol-containing resin. This resin makes the plant highly allergenic, causing severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>It is typically found in dense undergrowth and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
