<p>Tillandsia paraibensis, commonly known as the Para√≠ba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and unique growth habits, it is a popular ornamental plant among bromeliad enthusiasts.</p>
