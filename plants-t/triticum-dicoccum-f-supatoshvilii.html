                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum f. supatoshvilii</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum f. supatoshvilii, commonly known as the Georgian emmer wheat, is a botanical variant of emmer wheat characterized by its unique genetic makeup and morphological features.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Caucasus region and is distinguished by its semi-domesticated growth habit and specific leaf and spikelet structures. It exhibits a range of botanical traits, including a robust root system and a hardy, drought-resistant physiology. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-based grains.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an important subject for studies on ancient wheat domestication and crop resilience.</p>
