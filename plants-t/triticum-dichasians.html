                    <h1>Triticum dichasians</h1>
<p>Triticum dichasians, commonly known as the two-branch wheat, is a wild relative of common wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to produce two distinct types of inflorescences. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has small, spikelet-bearing stems. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a flowering structure that differs from cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
