                    <h1>Tillandsia oranensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia oranensis, commonly known as the Orange Island air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
