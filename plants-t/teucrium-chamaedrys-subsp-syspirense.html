<p>Teucrium chamaedrys subsp.</p>
<p>syspirense, commonly known as the creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers in terminal clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf shape and flowering patterns compared to the typical form of T. chamaedrys.</p>
