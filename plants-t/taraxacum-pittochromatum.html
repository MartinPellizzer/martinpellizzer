                    <h1>Taraxacum pittochromatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pittochromatum, commonly known as the purple-chromated dandelion, is a rare and striking variant of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged flower heads, which set it apart from the typical yellow dandelions. The plant exhibits a robust rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the genus, but the unique coloration of the inflorescence makes it visually remarkable.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its rare coloration and potential ecological significance.</p>
