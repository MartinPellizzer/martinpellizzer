                            <h1>Tragacantha Mollissima</h1>
<p>Tragacantha mollissima is a rare and unique plant known for its distinctive appearance and medicinal properties. It thrives in specific arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant's most notable feature is its thick, fleshy leaves that store moisture, allowing it to survive in drought-prone regions. Its flowers, often pale or yellowish, add a subtle beauty to its surroundings. Despite its ecological significance, it remains under-studied and endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
