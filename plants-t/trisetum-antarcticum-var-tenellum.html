                    <h1>Trisetum antarcticum var. tenellum</h1>
<p>Trisetum antarcticum var. tenellum, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and high UV radiation.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems.</p>
