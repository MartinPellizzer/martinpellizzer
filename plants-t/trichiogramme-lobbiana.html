                    <h1>Trichiogramme lobbiana</h1>
<p>Trichiogramme lobbiana, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellow or brownish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It is found in various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
