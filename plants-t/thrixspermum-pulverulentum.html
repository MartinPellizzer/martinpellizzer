                    <h1>Thrixspermum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Thrixspermum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dustflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
