<p>Tetralix cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystal Hill saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Tetralix cristalensis is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
