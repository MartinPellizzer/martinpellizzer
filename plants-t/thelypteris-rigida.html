                    <h1>Thelypteris rigida</h1>
<p>Thelypteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, brown indusium. Thelypteris rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
