<p>Tillaeastrum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some level of protection to the host through its dense foliage. It is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
