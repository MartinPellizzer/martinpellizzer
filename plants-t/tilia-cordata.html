                    <h1>Tilia cordata</h1>
<p>Tilia cordata, commonly known as small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall in optimal conditions.</p>
