<p>Triticum juvenale, commonly known as the wild wheat or dwarf wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish glumes. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of cultivated wheat but are generally smaller and less productive.</p>
<p>Triticum juvenale is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
