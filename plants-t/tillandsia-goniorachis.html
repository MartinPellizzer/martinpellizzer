                    <h1>Tillandsia goniorachis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia goniorachis, commonly known as the silver-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often violet or purple in color.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
