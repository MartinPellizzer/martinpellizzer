<p>Thlaspi salticola, commonly known as the saltbush buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain water in harsh conditions. Thlaspi salticola is often found in coastal areas, salt flats, and dry soils where it thrives despite high salinity.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme environments makes it an important species in ecological studies of halophytes.</p>
