<p>Trichipteris oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinct, toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium.</p>
