                    <h1>Trichomanes formosanum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes formosanum, commonly known as the Taiwan holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a dense covering of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
