<p>Trisetaria pumila subsp.</p>
<p>fuscescens, commonly known as the pale sandreed, is a low-growing grass species native to sandy and coastal environments. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains pale green to brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
