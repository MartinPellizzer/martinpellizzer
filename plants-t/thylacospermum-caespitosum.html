                    <h1>Thylacospermum caespitosum</h1>
<p>Thylacospermum caespitosum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, with the alga providing photosynthetic capability and the fungus offering structural support. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats across North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
