                    <h1>Triticum maximum</h1>
<p>Triticum maximum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerousé¢– (glumes) and florets. Its seeds are encased in a tough, inedible husk, which makes it less suitable for direct human consumption.</p>
<p>However, it has been used historically in traditional agriculture and for forage purposes.</p>
