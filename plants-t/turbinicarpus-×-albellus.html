<p>Turbinicarpus × albellus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Turbinicarpus leucopappus and Turbinicarpus calycinus, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It requires well-draining soil and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through seeds or by grafting onto a suitable rootstock.</p>
