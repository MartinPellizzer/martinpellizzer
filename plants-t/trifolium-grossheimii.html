                    <h1>Trifolium grossheimii</h1>
<p>Trifolium grossheimii, commonly known as the Grossheim's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, pink to purple flowers in early spring. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
