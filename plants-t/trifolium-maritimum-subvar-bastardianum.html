                    <h1>Trifolium maritimum subvar. bastardianum</h1>
<p>Trifolium maritimum subvar. bastardianum, commonly known as the bastard clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard trifolium species. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in maritime environments where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
