                    <h1>Tarachia truncata</h1>
<p>Tarachia truncata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, succulent appearance, with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tarachia truncata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
