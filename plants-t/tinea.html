                    <h1>Tinea</h1>
<p>Tinea, commonly known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that affects the skin, hair, and nails rather than a plant.</p>
<p>It is caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi that thrive on keratin found in these tissues. Unlike plants, tinea does not have roots, stems, or leaves, and it is not a botanical organism. The term "tinea" comes from the Latin word for "wound," reflecting its characteristic ring-shaped lesions.</p>
<p>While it is not a plant, it is sometimes mistaken for a botanical term due to its name.</p>
