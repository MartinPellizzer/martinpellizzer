                    <h1>Tamarix boveana var. longipes</h1>
<p>Tamarix boveana var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in coastal or saline environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soils make it useful for erosion control in certain ecological contexts.</p>
