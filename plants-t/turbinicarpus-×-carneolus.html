                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × carneolus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × carneolus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Turbinicarpus calyciflorus and Turbinicarpus mesembryanthemum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often propagated through seed or grafting to maintain its unique characteristics.</p>
