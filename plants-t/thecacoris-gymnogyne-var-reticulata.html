                    <h1>Thecacoris gymnogyne var. reticulata</h1>
<p>Thecacoris gymnogyne var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive reticulate pattern, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
