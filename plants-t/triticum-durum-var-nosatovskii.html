                    <h1>Triticum durum var. nosatovskii</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. nosatovskii, commonly known as a wild wheat species, is a grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hardy, drought-resistant nature and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are encased in tough hulls, which make them difficult to process but well-suited for traditional milling methods.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
