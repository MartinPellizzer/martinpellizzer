                    <h1>Thelypteris catamarcensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarca fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it forms dense colonies. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris catamarcensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range.</p>
