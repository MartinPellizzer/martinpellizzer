                    <h1>Triticum forskalei</h1>
<p>Triticum forskalei, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, similar to cultivated wheat species. Triticum forskalei is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup has been studied for its potential contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
