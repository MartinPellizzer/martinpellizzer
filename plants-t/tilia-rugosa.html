                    <h1>Tilia rugosa</h1>
<p>Tilia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, wrinkled leaves that give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. These flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its lightweight and workable nature.</p>
