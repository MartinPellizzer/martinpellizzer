                    <h1>Thesium aellenianum</h1>
<p>Thesium aellenianum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Thesium aellenianum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
