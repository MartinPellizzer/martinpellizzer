                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides f. cretacea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides f. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous Spanish moss, is a variant of the air plant Tillandsia usneoides.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging, thread-like stems that form dense, moss-like clusters. It is native to regions in the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its historical presence in fossil records, indicating its ancient lineage.</p>
