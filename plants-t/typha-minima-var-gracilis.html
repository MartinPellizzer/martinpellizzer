                    <h1>Typha minima var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Typha minima var. gracilis, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into cylindrical seed heads. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other Typha species by its slender, more delicate appearance and shorter stature.</p>
