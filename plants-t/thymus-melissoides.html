<p>Thymus melissoides, commonly known as honeyleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
