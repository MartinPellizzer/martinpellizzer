                    <h1>Tillandsia mollis var. reptans</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mollis var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs nutrients and water through its leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with good air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
