                    <h1>Thelypteris quelpartensis var. quelpartensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris quelpartensis var. quelpartensis, commonly known as the Quelpart holly fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, wiry rachis. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in pairs.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
