                    <h1>Tetramorphaea belangeriana</h1>
<p>Tetramorphaea belangeriana, commonly known as the Belanger's tetramorpha, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its reproductive cycle involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, making it an important species for studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
