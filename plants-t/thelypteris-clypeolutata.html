<p>Thelypteris clypeolutata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris clypeolutata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study and a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
