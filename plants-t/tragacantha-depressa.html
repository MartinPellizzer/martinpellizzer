                    <h1>Tragacantha depressa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha depressa, commonly known as the dwarf tragacanth, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are narrow, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to other members of the Astragalus genus, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Tragacantha depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
