<p>anjenabense, commonly known as the Anjenabense tripleleaf, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being elliptical and slightly serrated. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
