<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>atratum, commonly known as naked rye, is a wild wheat species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hollow stems and the absence of a protective hull around its grains, which distinguishes it from other rye varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in cooler, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs.</p>
