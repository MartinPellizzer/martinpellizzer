<p>Thelypteris littoralis, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic among ferns. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Thelypteris littoralis is an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
