                    <h1>Tryonia areniticola</h1>
<p>Tryonia areniticola, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus that is typically light to dark green in color. The plant forms symbiotic associations with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its structure allows it to retain moisture and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Tryonia areniticola is often found on rocky surfaces, especially sandstone, in regions with low rainfall.</p>
