<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring pinnate leaves with five to nine pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are often mistaken for true stars due to their appearance.

<p>Triumfetta flavescens is adapted to dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
