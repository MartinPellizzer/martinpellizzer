<p>Typha gigantea, commonly known as the giant cattail, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or yellowish in color. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Typha gigantea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
