                    <h1>Tropidia saprophytica</h1>
<p>Tropidia saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are usually small and clustered at the base, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is often found in wetland or swamp environments.</p>
