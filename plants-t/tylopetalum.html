<p>Tylopetalum, commonly known as the "saddle-back" or "saddle fern," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Tylopetalum species are native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unusual floral structures.</p>
