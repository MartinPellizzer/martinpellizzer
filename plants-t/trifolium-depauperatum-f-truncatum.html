                    <h1>Trifolium depauperatum f. truncatum</h1>
<p>Trifolium depauperatum f. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated clover, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the genus Trifolium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate-shaped leaves that differ from the typical trifoliate structure of most clovers. This plant is often found in specific, often nutrient-poor habitats, such as rocky soils or disturbed areas. Its botanical features include small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
