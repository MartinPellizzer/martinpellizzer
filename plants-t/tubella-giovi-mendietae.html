<p>[WRONG START] Tubella giovi-mendietaa, commonly known as the Giovi-Mendieta's tube lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a pale yellow to orange thallus with a distinct, tubular structure. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, typical of lichens. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often on tree bark in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for assessing environmental health.</p>
