                    <h1>Trillium grandiflorum f. dimerum</h1>
<p>Trillium grandiflorum f. dimerum, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white trillium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical form, with reduced leaf size and a shorter stem. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Trillium genus. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
