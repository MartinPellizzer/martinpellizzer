<p>Taraxacum serotinum subsp.</p>
<p>besarabicum, commonly known as the Arabian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, elongated flower stem topped with a composite flower head that turns from yellow to reddish as it matures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the Compositae family, and it has a deep taproot that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
