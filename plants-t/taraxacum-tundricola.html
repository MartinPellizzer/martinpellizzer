                    <h1>Taraxacum tundricola</h1>
<p>Taraxacum tundricola, commonly known as the tundra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
