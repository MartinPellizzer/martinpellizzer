                    <h1>Trichomanes paradoxum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its small, sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a specialized indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes paradoxum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
