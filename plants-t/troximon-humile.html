                    <h1>Troximon humile</h1>
<p>Troximon humile, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of feather-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. Native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Troximon humile is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
