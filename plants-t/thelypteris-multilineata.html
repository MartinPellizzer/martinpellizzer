<p>Thelypteris multilineata, commonly known as the multilined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus.</p>
<p>Thelypteris multilineata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
