<p>Trichocentrum cymbiglossum, commonly known as the cymbiglossum orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is typical of many orchids, with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients.</p>
