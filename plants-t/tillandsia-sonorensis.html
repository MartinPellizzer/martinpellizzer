                    <h1>Tillandsia sonorensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Sonoran Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sonorensis is well adapted to dry conditions, requiring minimal water and thriving in bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
