                    <h1>Tillandsia spinosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spinosa, commonly known as the spinous air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, curly foliage that helps it capture moisture from the air, and it lacks traditional roots. Tillandsia spinosa is known for its striking, spiky appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique aesthetic and low maintenance requirements.</p>
