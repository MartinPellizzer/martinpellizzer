                    <h1>Trifolium folliculatum</h1>
<p>Trifolium folliculatum, commonly known as the folliculate clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that mature into follicles, a type of dry fruit that splits open to release seeds. Trifolium folliculatum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and ecological function make it an important plant in certain ecosystems.</p>
