<p>Triticum nardus, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Triticum nardus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
