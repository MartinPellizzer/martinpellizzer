<p>Trichomanes kaulfussii subsp.</p>
<p>ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are small and clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>
