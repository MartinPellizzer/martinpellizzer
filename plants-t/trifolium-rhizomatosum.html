<p>Trifolium rhizomatosum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trifolium rhizomatosum is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
