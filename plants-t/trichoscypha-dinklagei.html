                    <h1>Trichoscypha dinklagei</h1>
<p>Trichoscypha dinklagei, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
