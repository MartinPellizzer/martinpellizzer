                    <h1>Triticum durum var. hordeiforme</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. hordeiforme, commonly known as wild durum wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated durum wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard seeds that are typically wind-dispersed. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It has narrow leaves and produces spikes that bear a resemblance to barley, hence its name.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance and disease resistance in wheat crops.</p>
