<p>Thelypteris middle-earthica, commonly known as the Middle-earth Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate forests of the fictional Middle-earth.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and densely veined. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology has made it a subject of interest in both botanical and fantasy studies.</p>
