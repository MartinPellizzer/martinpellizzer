<p>Toxicodendron volubile, commonly known as the climbing poison ivy, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Toxicodendron volubile is known for its urushiol oil, which causes severe skin irritation in many people.</p>
