                    <h1>Tamarix mannifera var. persica</h1>
<p>Tamarix mannifera var. persica, commonly known as Persian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, often reddish-pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments, reducing water loss through transpiration. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of salt-resistant tissue, which helps it thrive in saline soils.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
