                    <h1>Tetrapodenia</h1>
<p>Tetrapodenia, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from the host tree, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Tetrapodenia is often found in forested areas and can play a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
