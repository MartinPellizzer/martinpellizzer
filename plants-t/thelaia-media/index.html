                            <h1>Thelaia Media</h1>
<p>Common sunflower, scientifically known as Thelaia media, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family that captivates with its bold yellow petals and a dark, central disk. Native to temperate regions, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its towering stature and vibrant blooms make it a symbol of warmth and positivity, often associated with the sun itself. The plant's ability to follow the sun's movement, known as heliotropism, adds to its unique charm and ecological significance. Whether cultivated for its beauty or its practical uses, the common sunflower remains a timeless favorite among botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
