<p>Tillaea cymosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tillaea cymosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
