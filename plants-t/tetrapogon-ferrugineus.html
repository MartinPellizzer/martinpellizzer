<p>Tetrapogon ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Tetrapogon ferrugineus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range.</p>
