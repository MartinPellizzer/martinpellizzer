                    <h1>Triticum truncatum</h1>
<p>Triticum truncatum, commonly known as the short-awned wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, blunt awns on its florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields as a weed. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and spikelets that are usually arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Triticum truncatum has been studied for its potential in genetic research due to its genome size and adaptability.</p>
