<p>Thamnopteris pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, thick, and leathery fronds that help it thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of ponds or streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thamnopteris pachyphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation.</p>
