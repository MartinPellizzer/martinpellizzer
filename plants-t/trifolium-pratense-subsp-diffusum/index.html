                            <h1>Trifolium Pratense Subsp. Diffusum</h1>
<p>Trifolium pratense subsp. diffusum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This species is widely used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its historical significance in herbal medicine and traditional practices adds to its ecological and cultural value.</p>
