                    <h1>Trapa litwinowii var. chihuensis</h1>
<p>Trapa litwinowii var. chihuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by waterfowl and other aquatic animals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense vegetation that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
