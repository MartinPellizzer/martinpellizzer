<p>Trichocereus bridgesii, commonly known as the "Holy Cactus" or "Palo de Santa," is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, often in the spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trichocereus bridgesii is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it significant in both cultural and scientific contexts.</p>
