                    <h1>Tillandsia guerreroensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia guerreroensis, commonly known as the Guerrero air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
