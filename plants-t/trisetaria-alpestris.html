                    <h1>Trisetaria alpestris</h1>
<p>Trisetaria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
