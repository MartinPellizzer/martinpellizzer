<p>Trisetum cernuum var. projectum, commonly known as the nodding hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching stems that bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen, while its flowers are wind-pollinated.</p>
