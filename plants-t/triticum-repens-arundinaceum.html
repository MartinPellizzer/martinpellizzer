                    <h1>Triticum repens arundinaceum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens arundinaceum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in agricultural and ecological settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
