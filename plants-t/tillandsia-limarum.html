                    <h1>Tillandsia limarum</h1>
<p>Tillandsia limarum, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia limarum is popular as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
