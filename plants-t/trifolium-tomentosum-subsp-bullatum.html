<p>Trifolium tomentosum subsp.</p>
<p>bullatum, commonly known as the woolly clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its trifoliate leaves are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
