                    <h1>Tillandsia lutheri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Tillandsia lutheri is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
