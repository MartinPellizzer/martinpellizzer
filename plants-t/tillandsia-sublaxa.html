<p>Tillandsia sublaxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sublaxa is known for its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
