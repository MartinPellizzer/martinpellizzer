                    <h1>Trichophorum cespitosum</h1>
<p>Trichophorum cespitosum, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Trichophorum cespitosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments.</p>
