<p>Trichomanes trinerve, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Trichomanes trinerve thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Its intricate leaf structure and unique reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
