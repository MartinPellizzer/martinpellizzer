<p>Taraxacum percrispum, commonly known as the brittleleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head after blooming. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum percrispum is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
