<p>Tillandsia arenicola, commonly known as the sand tillandsia, is a unique air plant native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained environments and is adapted to arid conditions. This plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. Its rosette-shaped foliage is covered in dense, fuzzy trichomes that aid in water retention.</p>
