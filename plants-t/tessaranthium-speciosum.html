                    <h1>Tessaranthium speciosum</h1>
<p>Tessaranthium speciosum, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Native to the misty cloud forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Its unique growth pattern involves a sympodial structure, with each stem producing a cluster of flowering spikes.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Tessaranthium speciosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
