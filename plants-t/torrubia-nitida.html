                    <h1>Torrubia nitida</h1>
<p>Torrubia nitida, commonly known as the slender torrubia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
