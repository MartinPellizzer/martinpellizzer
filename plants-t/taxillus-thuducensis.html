                    <h1>Taxillus thuducensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus thuducensis, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some energy through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with the host, often causing structural weakening over time.</p>
<p>Taxillus thuducensis is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is an example of a plant that plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
