                    <h1>Trichotosia vestita</h1>
<p>Trichotosia vestita, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, thread-like leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Trichotosia vestita is considered critically endangered.</p>
