<p>Tapinanthus brunneus subsp.</p>
<p>buchholzii, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, vine-like appearance. It is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas, where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
