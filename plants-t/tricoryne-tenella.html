                    <h1>Tricoryne tenella</h1>
<p>Tricoryne tenella, commonly known as the small leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Tricoryne tenella is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
