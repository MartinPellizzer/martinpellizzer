<p>Tristira pubescens f. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The plant's fibrous roots and ability to climb or trail along the ground contribute to its widespread distribution and ecological impact.</p>
