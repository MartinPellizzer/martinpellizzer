                    <h1>Trochocephalus sphaciotia</h1>
<p>Trochocephalus sphaciotia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Trochocephalus sphaciotia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
