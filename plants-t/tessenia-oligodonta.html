                    <h1>Tessenia oligodonta</h1>
<p>Tessenia oligodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tessenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the late spring and early summer. Tessenia oligodonta is typically found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
