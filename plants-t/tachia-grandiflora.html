                    <h1>Tachia grandiflora</h1>
<p>Tachia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant swamp lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Tachia grandiflora plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic life.</p>
