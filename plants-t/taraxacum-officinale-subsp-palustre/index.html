                            <h1>Taraxacum Officinale Subsp. Palustre</h1>
<p>Marsh dandelion, scientifically known as Taraxacum officinale subsp. palustre, is a hardy perennial plant commonly found in wetlands and moist soils across temperate regions. It thrives in areas with standing water or frequent moisture, making it a resilient species in challenging environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive rosette of basal leaves and a hollow stem that supports its bright yellow flowers. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to the typical dandelion found in gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
