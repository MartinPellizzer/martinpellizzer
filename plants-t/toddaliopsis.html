                    <h1>Toddaliopsis</h1>
<p>Toddaliopsis, commonly known as the small-leaved dodder.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on host plants for nutrients. Toddaliopsis typically attaches to the stems or leaves of its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind or insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
