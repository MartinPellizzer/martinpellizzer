<p>Thelocactus buekii subsp.</p>
<p>jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae thlocactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to a very limited geographic region in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular stem and a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on desert flora and evolutionary adaptation.</p>
