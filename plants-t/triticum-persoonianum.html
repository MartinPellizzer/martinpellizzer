                    <h1>Triticum persoonianum</h1>
<p>Triticum persoonianum, commonly known as Persian wheat, is a species of wild grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing a single grain. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to domesticated wheat species.</p>
