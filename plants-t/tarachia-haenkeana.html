                    <h1>Tarachia haenkeana</h1>
<p>Tarachia haenkeana, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fleshy, red berries that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are typically small, waxy, and arranged in a spiral pattern to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tarachia haenkeana is well adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources.</p>
