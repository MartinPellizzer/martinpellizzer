                    <h1>Tapinanthus sankuruensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus sankuruensis, commonly known as the Sankuru dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a twining habit, often growing around the stems of other plants. It is typically found in moist, forested areas and is an example of hemiparasitism.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
