                    <h1>Thymophylla thurberi</h1>
<p>Thymophylla thurberi, commonly known as the desert thymophylla, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as desert flats and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, while its flowers are often white or pale green, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Thymophylla thurberi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements.</p>
