                    <h1>Trophis macrostachya</h1>
<p>Trophis macrostachya, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant features showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are buoyant and supported by a network of air-filled chambers, enabling the plant to float on the water's surface.</p>
