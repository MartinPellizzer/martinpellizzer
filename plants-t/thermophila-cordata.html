                    <h1>Thermophila cordata</h1>
<p>Thermophila cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf thermophila, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions with high thermal activity.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found near geothermal springs or in volcanic soils. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in high-temperature conditions that are detrimental to most other plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Thermophila cordata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
