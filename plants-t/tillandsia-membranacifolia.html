                    <h1>Tillandsia membranacifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia membranacifolia, commonly known as the membranous sword air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the base of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia membranacifolia is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate light for optimal growth.</p>
