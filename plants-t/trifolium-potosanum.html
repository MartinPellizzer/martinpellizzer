The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium potosanum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
