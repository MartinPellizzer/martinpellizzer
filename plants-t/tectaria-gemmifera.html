<p>Tectaria gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant produces gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. These gemmae are often found on the underside of the fronds and can detach to form new plants.</p>
<p>Tectaria gemmifera is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
