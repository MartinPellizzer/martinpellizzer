<p>Trapa alatyrica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, woody fruits that resemble small nuts. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by water and can remain viable for several years.</p>
