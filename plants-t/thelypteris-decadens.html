<p>Thelypteris decadens, commonly known as the decaying fern, is a species of fern found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris decadens plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem due to its rapid decomposition.</p>
