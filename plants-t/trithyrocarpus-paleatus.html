                    <h1>Trithyrocarpus paleatus</h1>
<p>Trithyrocarpus paleatus, commonly known as the pale leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on separate male and female plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
