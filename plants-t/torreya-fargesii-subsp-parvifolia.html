<p>Torreya fargesii subsp.</p>
<p>parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved torreya, is a rare and reclusive evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, and its seeds are dispersed by animals. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
