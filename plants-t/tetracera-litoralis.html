<p>Tetracera litoralis, commonly known as the sea tetracera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Tetracera litoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
