                    <h1>Thymus × korbii</h1>
<p>Thymus × korbii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Thymus vulgaris (common thyme) and Thymus serpyllum (wild thyme), resulting in a plant with a compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It produces small, pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is widely used in herbal medicine, cooking, and ornamental gardening due to its fragrance and hardiness.</p>
