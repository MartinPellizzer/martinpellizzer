                            <h1>Tetrapleura Tetraptera</h1>
<p>Tetrapleura tree, scientifically known as Tetrapleura tetraptera, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture making. The tree also has medicinal uses, with its bark and leaves traditionally used in herbal remedies for various ailments. Its unique appearance, with thick, ridged bark and clustered leaves, makes it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat. Despite its usefulness, the Tetrapleura tree faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
