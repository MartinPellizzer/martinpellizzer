                    <h1>Tapinanthus oleifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus oleifolius, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure that attaches to its host. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs, particularly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
