                    <h1>Tillandsia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening.</p>
