                    <h1>Trifolium orphanideum</h1>
<p>Trifolium orphanideum, commonly known as the orphan's clover, is a rare and lesser-known species of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
