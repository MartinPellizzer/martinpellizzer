                    <h1>Trichomanes krausii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes krausii, commonly known as the Kraus's fern, is a rare and endangered species of fern native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on limestone substrates. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichomanes krausii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
