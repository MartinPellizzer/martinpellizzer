                    <h1>Tamarix trabutii</h1>
<p>Tamarix trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix trabutii is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
