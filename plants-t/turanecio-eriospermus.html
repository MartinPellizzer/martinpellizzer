                    <h1>Turanecio eriospermus</h1>
<p>Turanecio eriospermus, commonly known as the woolly turanecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Turanecio eriospermus is an important species for studying plant responses to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
