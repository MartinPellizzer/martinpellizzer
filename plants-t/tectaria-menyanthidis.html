                    <h1>Tectaria menyanthidis</h1>
<p>Tectaria menyanthidis, commonly known as the fern moss or tectaria, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lobed thallus that often forms dense, cushion-like mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. Tectaria menyanthidis typically thrives in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
