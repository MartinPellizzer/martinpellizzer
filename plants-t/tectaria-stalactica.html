                    <h1>Tectaria stalactica</h1>
<p>Tectaria stalactica, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble hanging chains, giving it its common name. The plant's leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, which help in maximizing surface area for photosynthesis. Tectaria stalactica is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its ecological niche.</p>
