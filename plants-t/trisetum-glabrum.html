<p>Trisetum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer.</p>
<p>Trisetum glabrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
