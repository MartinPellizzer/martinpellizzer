                    <h1>Tillandsia violacea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia violacea, commonly known as the violet air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant produces vibrant violet to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it capture and retain water.</p>
<p>Tillandsia violacea is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
