                    <h1>Turbinicarpus subterraneus var. zaragosae</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus subterraneus var. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza rock cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Spain, specifically the province of Zaragoza, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, appear in late spring and are relatively short-lived.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, this variety is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
