<p>Thelypteris neglecta, commonly known as the common water fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris neglecta reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds.</p>
