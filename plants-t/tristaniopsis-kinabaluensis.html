<p>Tristaniopsis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu tristaniopsis, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude forests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in the cool, humid conditions of the montane rainforest, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
