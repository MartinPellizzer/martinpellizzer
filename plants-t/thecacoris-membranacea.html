<p>Thecacoris membranacea, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia, it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. The plant's leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted for water retention.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject in the study of carnivorous plants.</p>
