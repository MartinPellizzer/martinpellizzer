<p>Thalictrum abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that create a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
