                    <h1>Thelypteris multigemmifera</h1>
<p>Thelypteris multigemmifera, commonly known as the clustered shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely packed, leathery fronds that often form a compact, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple buds, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive, dark green color and a smooth, glossy texture.</p>
