<p>Tragopogon longirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated central tube, which is a defining feature of the genus Tragopogon. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in association with other species of the genus.</p>
<p>Tragopogon longirostris is also notable for its role in hybridization with other Tragopogon species, contributing to the study of evolutionary botany.</p>
