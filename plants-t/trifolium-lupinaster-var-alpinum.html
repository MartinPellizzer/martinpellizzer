                    <h1>Trifolium lupinaster var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Trifolium lupinaster var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop in temperate climates.</p>
