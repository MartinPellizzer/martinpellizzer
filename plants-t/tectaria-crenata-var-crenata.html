<p>Tectaria crenata var. crenata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
