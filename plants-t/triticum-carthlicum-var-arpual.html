                    <h1>Triticum carthlicum var. arpual</h1>
<p>Triticum carthlicum var. arpual, commonly known as the Armenian wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils. The grain is hard and has a high protein content, making it valuable for traditional and artisanal baking.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a significant species for agricultural biodiversity.</p>
