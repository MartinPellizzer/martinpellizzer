                    <h1>Tillandsia rigidula</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help it anchor to surfaces and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are narrow, stiff, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rigidula is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
