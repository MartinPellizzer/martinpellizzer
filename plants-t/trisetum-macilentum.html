<p>Trisetum macilentum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned spikelets. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture.</p>
<p>Trisetum macilentum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
