                            <h1>Torenia Diffusa</h1>
<p>Torenia diffusa is a delicate flowering plant known for its vibrant, trumpet-shaped blooms. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in warm, humid environments with plenty of sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adding to its unique appearance. This plant is popular among gardeners for its ease of care and long-lasting flowers. Despite its beauty, Torenia diffusa requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot and ensure healthy growth.</p>
