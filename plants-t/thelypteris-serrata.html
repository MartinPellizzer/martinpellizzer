<p>Thelypteris serrata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins and a distinctive, shield-shaped frond structure. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
