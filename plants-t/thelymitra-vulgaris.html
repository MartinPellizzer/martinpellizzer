<p>Thelymitra vulgaris, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and heathlands. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Thelymitra vulgaris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
