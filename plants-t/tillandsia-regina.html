                    <h1>Tillandsia regina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia regina, commonly known as the Royal Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a textured appearance, which helps it capture and retain water efficiently. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, adding visual interest.</p>
<p>Tillandsia regina is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique aesthetic.</p>
