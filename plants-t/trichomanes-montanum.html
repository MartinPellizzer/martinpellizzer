                    <h1>Trichomanes montanum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes montanum, commonly known as mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, glossy appearance, and it produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes montanum is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its habitat.</p>
