                    <h1>Terpsichore turrialbae</h1>
<p>Terpsichore turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in high humidity and cool, misty conditions, typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
