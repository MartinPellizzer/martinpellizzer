                    <h1>Tetrapora verrucosa</h1>
<p>Tetrapora verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a hairy or rough texture.</p>
<p>Tetrapora verrucosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
