                    <h1>Triaristellina anaristella</h1>
<p>Triaristellina anaristella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with consistently moist air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
