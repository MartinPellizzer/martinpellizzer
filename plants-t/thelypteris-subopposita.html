<p>Thelypteris subopposita, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often creeping rhizomes and biennial fronds that are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds. The leaves are pinnate, with pinnae that are opposite or sub-opposite, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures are borne on the upper part of the fronds, with sporangia clustered in sori along the margins of the pinnae.</p>
