                    <h1>Typha salgirica</h1>
<p>Typha salgirica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces long, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or yellowish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Typha salgirica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
