<p>Tunilla albisaetacens, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Tunilla albisaetacens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
