<p>Tillandsia maxima var. densior, commonly known as the dense tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are densely packed and covered in a thick layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in the spring.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
