<p>Trifolium repens subsp.</p>
<p>biasolettii, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically white or pale green, and its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in forage agriculture.</p>
