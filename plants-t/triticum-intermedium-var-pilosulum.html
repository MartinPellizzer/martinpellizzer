                    <h1>Triticum intermedium var. pilosulum</h1>
<p>Triticum intermedium var. pilosulum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass with a hairy stem, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks covered in fine, bristly hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It is often cultivated for its forage value and has potential in sustainable agriculture due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
