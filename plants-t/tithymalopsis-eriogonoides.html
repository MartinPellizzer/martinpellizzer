                    <h1>Tithymalopsis eriogonoides</h1>
<p>Tithymalopsis eriogonoides, commonly known as the desert tithymalopsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
