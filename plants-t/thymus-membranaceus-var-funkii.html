<p>Thymus membranaceus var. funkii, commonly known as the Funk's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme varieties.</p>
<p>The varietal form, Funkii, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flowering characteristics compared to the standard Thymus membranaceus.</p>
