<p>Toxicodendron sonderi, commonly known as the Sonder's poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
