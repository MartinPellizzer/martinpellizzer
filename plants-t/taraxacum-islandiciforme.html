                    <h1>Taraxacum islandiciforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum islandiciforme, commonly known as the Iceland dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Iceland and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed capsule known as a pappus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas.</p>
