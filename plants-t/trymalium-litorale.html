                    <h1>Trymalium litorale</h1>
<p>Trymalium litorale, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is well adapted to salt spray and wind. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Trymalium litorale is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
