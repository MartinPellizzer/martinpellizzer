<p>It features a spherical or nearly spherical stem that is typically covered in short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
