<p>Thelypteris chimboracensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris chimboracensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
