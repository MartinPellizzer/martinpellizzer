The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>Tormentilla reptans humilis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
