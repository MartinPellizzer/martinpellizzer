                    <h1>Tubiflora caroliniensis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Tubiflora caroliniensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine forests and along stream banks.</p>
