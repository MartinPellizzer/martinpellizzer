<p>Trifolium buxbaumii, commonly known as Buxbaum's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Buxbaum's clover is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
