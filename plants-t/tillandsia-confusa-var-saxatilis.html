                    <h1>Tillandsia confusa var. saxatilis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia confusa var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy texture, adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>It produces small, showy inflorescences with violet or purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
