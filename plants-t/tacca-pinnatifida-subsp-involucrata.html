<p>Tacca pinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>involucrata, commonly known as the "snake plant" or "mother-in-law's tongue," is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by a fleshy, spathe-like structure. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This species is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements.</p>
