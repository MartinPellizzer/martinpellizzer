<p>Timonius smithii, commonly known as the Smith's timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, delicate flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius smithii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
