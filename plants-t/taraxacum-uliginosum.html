                    <h1>Taraxacum uliginosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that blooms in early spring, followed by a distinctive pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
