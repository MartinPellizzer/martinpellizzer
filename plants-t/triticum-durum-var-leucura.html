                    <h1>Triticum durum var. leucura</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. leucura, commonly known as white durum wheat, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its pale, chalky endosperm.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets. It is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a moderate amount of rainfall during its growing season.</p>
<p>The grains are hard and have a low moisture content, contributing to their durability and storage life.</p>
