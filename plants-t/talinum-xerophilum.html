<p>Talinum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert spinach, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Talinum xerophilum is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and used in traditional cuisines across its native range.</p>
