<p>Taraxacum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that is often mistaken for a slender grass. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Taraxacum gracilipes is typically found in moist, open areas such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
