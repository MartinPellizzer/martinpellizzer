<p>Typha crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spike that is typically brown or reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Typha crassa thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds.</p>
