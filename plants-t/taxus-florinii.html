<p>Taxus florinii, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Taxus florinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also noted for containing toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
