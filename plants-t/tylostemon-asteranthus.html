<p>Tylostemon asteranthus, commonly known as the star-flowered tylostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the dry season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
