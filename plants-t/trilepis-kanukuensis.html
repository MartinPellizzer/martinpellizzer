                    <h1>Trilepis kanukuensis</h1>
<p>Trilepis kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often clustered near the base of its foliage. Its roots are highly adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trilepis kanukuensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
