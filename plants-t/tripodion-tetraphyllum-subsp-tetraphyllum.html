<p>Tripodion tetraphyllum subsp.</p>
<p>tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed mountain pine, is a rare and specialized coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of four, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this subspecies is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
