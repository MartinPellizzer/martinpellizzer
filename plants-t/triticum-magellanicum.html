                    <h1>Triticum magellanicum</h1>
<p>Triticum magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a grass species characterized by its slender stalks and spikelets, which contain small, awned grains. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in the Andes Mountains. Its genome contains valuable genetic diversity that can be used in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience.</p>
<p>Triticum magellanicum plays an important role in agricultural research due to its potential for enhancing crop yield and stress tolerance.</p>
