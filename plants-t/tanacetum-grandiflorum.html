                    <h1>Tanacetum grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum grandiflorum, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom.</p>
<p>Tanacetum grandiflorum is often used in herbal medicine and as a garden ornamental due to its hardiness and long-lasting blooms.</p>
