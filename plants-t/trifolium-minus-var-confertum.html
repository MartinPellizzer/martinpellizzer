                    <h1>Trifolium minus var. confertum</h1>
<p>Trifolium minus var. confertum, commonly known as the dense clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and dense foliage, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop.</p>
