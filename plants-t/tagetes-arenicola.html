                    <h1>Tagetes arenicola</h1>
<p>Tagetes arenicola, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tagetes arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local pollinators.</p>
