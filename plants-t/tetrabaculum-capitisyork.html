The plant features waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight bluish tint. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
