                    <h1>Tomentaurum niveum</h1>
<p>Tomentaurum niveum, commonly known as the snow-tufted plant, is a unique species characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is native to high-altitude regions and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its foliage is typically grayish-white due to the presence of fine, soft hairs that help insulate it from extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Tomentaurum niveum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats where few other plants can survive.</p>
