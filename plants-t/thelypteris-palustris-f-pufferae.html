                    <h1>Thelypteris palustris f. pufferae</h1>
<p>Thelypteris palustris f. pufferae, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the ecological succession of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This fern is an important indicator species for the health of wetland environments.</p>
