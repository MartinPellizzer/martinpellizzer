<p>Trifolium pantocsekii, commonly known as the Pantocsek's clover, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium pantocsekii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
