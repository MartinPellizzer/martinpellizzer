                    <h1>Tillandsia convoluta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia convoluta, commonly known as the curling air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, curling leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
