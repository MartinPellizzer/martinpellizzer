<p>Thelypteris lurida, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often have a reddish or rusty-colored margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable among other fern species.</p>
