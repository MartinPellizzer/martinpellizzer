                    <h1>Toxicodendron wallichii var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron wallichii var. microcarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited poison ivy, is a variant of the broader Toxicodendron genus.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Nepal, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in catkins, and it produces tiny, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its urushiol-containing sap, it is a common cause of contact dermatitis in those who come into contact with its foliage.</p>
