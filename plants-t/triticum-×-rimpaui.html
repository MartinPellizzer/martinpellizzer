                    <h1>Triticum × rimpaui</h1>
<p>Triticum × rimpaui, commonly known as the rye wheat hybrid, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale).</p>
<p>It possesses a large genome size due to the combination of genomes from both parent species. The plant typically exhibits robust growth and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and spike-like inflorescence. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bract-covered florets.</p>
<p>This hybrid is primarily of interest in genetic research for its potential in enhancing wheat traits through introgression of rye genes.</p>
