                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. quasiheraticum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. quasiheraticum, commonly known as the near-herbaceous wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a more herbaceous appearance compared to typical wheat, with thinner stalks and a more fibrous structure. It is primarily found in temperate regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's morphology suggests adaptations to cooler climates and possibly shorter growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its study contributes to understanding genetic diversity within the wheat genus.</p>
