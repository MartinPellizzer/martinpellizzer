<p>[WRONG START] Tectaria × pteropus-miner, commonly known as the hybrid tree fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Tectaria pteropus and Tectaria minor.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
