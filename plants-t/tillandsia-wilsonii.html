<p>Tillandsia wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Tillandsia genus, which is known for its ability to grow without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap water and provide a habitat for small organisms. It produces striking clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in the spring or summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia wilsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
