                    <h1>Triticum polonicum var. turgidum</h1>
<p>Triticum polonicum var. turgidum, commonly known as the Polish wheat or turgid wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing heads that contain florets with both male and female reproductive structures. It is adapted to temperate climates and often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to environmental stress.</p>
