                    <h1>Thelypteris × altissima</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × altissima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, typically *Thelypteris acutifrons* and *Thelypteris bolanderi*.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris × altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
