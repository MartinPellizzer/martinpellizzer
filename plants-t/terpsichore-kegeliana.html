                    <h1>Terpsichore kegeliana</h1>
<p>Terpsichore kegeliana, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pale lavender petals with a subtle iridescent sheen that seems to glow under moonlight. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed around its flowering stems. Its flowers bloom in late summer, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
