                    <h1>Tillandsia rupicola</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rupicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that help it anchor to rocky substrates and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rupicola produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat.</p>
