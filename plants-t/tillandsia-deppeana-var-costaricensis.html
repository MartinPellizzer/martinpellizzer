                    <h1>Tillandsia deppeana var. costaricensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia deppeana var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
