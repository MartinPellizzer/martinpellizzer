<p>Trifolium glanduliferum var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with glandular structures on their surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
