                    <h1>Trocdaris</h1>
<p>Trocdaris, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Trocdaris is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
