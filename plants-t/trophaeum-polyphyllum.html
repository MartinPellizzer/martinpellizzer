<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Trophaeum polyphyllum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
