                    <h1>Tillandsia intermedia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia intermedia, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>Tillandsia intermedia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in indoor settings.</p>
