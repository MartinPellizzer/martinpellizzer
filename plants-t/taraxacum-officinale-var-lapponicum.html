                    <h1>Taraxacum officinale var. lapponicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum officinale var. lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are spoon-shaped and gradually become more lanceolate towards the stem. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually shorter and more upright compared to the common dandelion, and the seeds are dispersed via a parachute-like structure.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and arctic tundra environments.</p>
