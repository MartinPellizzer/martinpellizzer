                    <h1>Turanga illicitana</h1>
<p>Turanga illicitana, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its roots contain a potent alkaloid used in traditional medicine, though it is highly toxic in large doses.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Turanga illicitana is critically endangered and protected in most regions.</p>
