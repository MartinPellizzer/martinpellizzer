                    <h1>Tapinanthus warneckei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus warneckei, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for survival, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
