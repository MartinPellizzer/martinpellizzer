<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned grains.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its genetic makeup is closely related to domesticated wheat species, making it valuable for breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural use due to its low yield and hardy nature.</p>
