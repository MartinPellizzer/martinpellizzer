                    <h1>Tigarea tridentata</h1>
<p>Tigarea tridentata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three pointed lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Tigarea tridentata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
