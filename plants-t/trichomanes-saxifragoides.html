<p>Trichomanes saxifragoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
