                    <h1>Thecacoris cometia</h1>
<p>Thecacoris cometia, commonly known as the comet orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique bloom pattern, resembling a comet's tail, makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
