<p>Trifolium noricum var. praetutianum, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a rare and distinctive variety of the genus Trifolium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a pale green to white coloration. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in the Carpathian Mountains, where it thrives in cooler, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
