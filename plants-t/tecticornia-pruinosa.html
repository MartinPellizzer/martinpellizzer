                    <h1>Tecticornia pruinosa</h1>
<p>Tecticornia pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf tecticornia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Tecticornia pruinosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
