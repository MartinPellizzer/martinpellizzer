                    <h1>Tectaria hilocarpa</h1>
<p>Tectaria hilocarpa, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a large, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its broad, strap-like fronds to capture moisture and sunlight. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor to its substrate and absorb nutrients from the environment. Its fronds are usually divided into segments, with the upper portion bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Tectaria hilocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its lush, green foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
