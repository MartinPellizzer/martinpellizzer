                    <h1>Tithymalus chamaesula</h1>
<p>Tithymalus chamaesula, commonly known as the creeping tithymale, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Tithymalus chamaesula is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
