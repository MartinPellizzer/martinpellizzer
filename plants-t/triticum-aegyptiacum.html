                    <h1>Triticum aegyptiacum</h1>
<p>Triticum aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to golden spikelets, each containing several tiny, wind-pollinated florets. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Despite its historical significance in ancient agriculture, it is not widely cultivated today for grain production.</p>
