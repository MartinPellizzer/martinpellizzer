                    <h1>Thelesperma subnudum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Thelesperma subnudum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluebunch grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-green foliage and compact, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
