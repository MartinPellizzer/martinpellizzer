<p>Trixis verbasciformis, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds enable it to propagate in disturbed or barren environments.</p>
<p>Trixis verbasciformis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides food for various desert wildlife.</p>
