                    <h1>Tillandsia sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening.</p>
