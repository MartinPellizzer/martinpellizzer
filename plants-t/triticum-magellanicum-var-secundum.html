                    <h1>Triticum magellanicum var. secundum</h1>
<p>Triticum magellanicum var. secundum, commonly known as the secondary form of the Magellan wheat, is a wild grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, dark hulls, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
