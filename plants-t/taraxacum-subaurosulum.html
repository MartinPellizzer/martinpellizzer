                    <h1>Taraxacum subaurosulum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subaurosulum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, slender flowering stem. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
