<p>Trichomanes extravagans, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes extravagans is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
