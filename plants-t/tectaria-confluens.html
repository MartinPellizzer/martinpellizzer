                    <h1>Tectaria confluens</h1>
<p>Tectaria confluens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
