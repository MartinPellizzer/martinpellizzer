<p>Tripolium angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an important species in stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
