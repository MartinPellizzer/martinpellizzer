                    <h1>Thelypteris dichrotricha</h1>
<p>Thelypteris dichrotricha, commonly known as the two-colored water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into two color zonesâ€”usually a lighter green on the upper side and a darker green on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris dichrotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
