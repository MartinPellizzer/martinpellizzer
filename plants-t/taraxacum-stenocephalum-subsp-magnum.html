<p>Taraxacum stenocephalum subsp.</p>
<p>magnum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves. It produces a single, large, yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its size and is often mistaken for a larger dandelion species due to its prominent appearance.</p>
