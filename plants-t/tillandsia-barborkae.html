<p>Tillandsia barborkae, commonly known as the Barborka air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from a central stem, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
