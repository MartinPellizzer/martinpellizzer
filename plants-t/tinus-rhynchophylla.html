                    <h1>Tinus rhynchophylla</h1>
<p>Tinus rhynchophylla, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a notable species in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and conservation status, it is often protected in its natural habitat.</p>
