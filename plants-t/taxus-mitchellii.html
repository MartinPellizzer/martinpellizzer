                    <h1>Taxus mitchellii</h1>
<p>Taxus mitchellii, commonly known as the western yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus mitchellii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its wood is dense and durable, though it is not commonly used for commercial purposes due to its toxicity.</p>
