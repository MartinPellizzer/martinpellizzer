                    <h1>Tapinanthus friesiorum</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus friesiorum, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that belongs to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its slender, yellowish stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant's unique parasitic nature and ornamental appearance make it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic in agricultural settings.</p>
