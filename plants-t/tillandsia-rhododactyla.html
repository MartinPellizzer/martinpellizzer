                    <h1>Tillandsia rhododactyla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rhododactyla, commonly known as the red-tipped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically red or orange, with showy bracts that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rhododactyla is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
