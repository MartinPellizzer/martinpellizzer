                    <h1>Tribulus aquaticus</h1>
<p>Tribulus aquaticus, commonly known as water bindweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early summer. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native species in its habitat.</p>
