                            <h1>Tristylium Ochnaceum</h1>
<p>Lemon tree, scientifically known as Tristylium ochnaceum, is a tropical evergreen plant that thrives in warm climates. It is prized for its fragrant fruit, which is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall, with glossy green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, the lemon, is rich in vitamin C and has a sharp, tangy flavor. Despite its common name, the lemon tree is not related to the citrus family, but rather belongs to the Ochnaceae family.</p>
