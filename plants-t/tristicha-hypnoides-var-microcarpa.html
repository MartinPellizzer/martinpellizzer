                    <h1>Tristicha hypnoides var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Tristicha hypnoides var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited mossy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
