<p>Triticum turgidum var. aeternum, commonly known as the perpetual wheat, is a rare and ancient variant of wheat with unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, elongated leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, oval grains that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. Its genetic makeup is distinct, showing traits that suggest a possible link to early domesticated wheat species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers alike.</p>
