                <h1>Taraxacum simile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum simile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head, or "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with white, feathery parachutes.</p>
<p>This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils.</p>
