                    <h1>Thelypteris cristata var. clintoniana</h1>
<p>Thelypteris cristata var. clintoniana, commonly known as the Clinton's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often folded and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sporangia.</p>
