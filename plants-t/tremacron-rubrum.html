                    <h1>Tremacron rubrum</h1>
<p>Tremacron rubrum, commonly known as the crimson flame fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vibrant red foliage and unique frond structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
