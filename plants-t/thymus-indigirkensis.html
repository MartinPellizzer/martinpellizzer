<p>Thymus indigirkensis, commonly known as the Kashmir thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>

The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its essential oils contain thymol and other phenolic compounds, giving it a strong, pungent aroma.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
