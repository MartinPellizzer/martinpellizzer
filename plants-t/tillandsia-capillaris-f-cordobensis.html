                    <h1>Tillandsia capillaris f. cordobensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia capillaris f. cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, colorful inflorescences with violet or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
