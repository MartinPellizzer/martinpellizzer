                    <h1>Tillandsia propinqua var. rectangula</h1>
<p>Tillandsia propinqua var. rectangula, commonly known as the rectangular air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding cup. Its foliage is often a striking silver-green color with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
