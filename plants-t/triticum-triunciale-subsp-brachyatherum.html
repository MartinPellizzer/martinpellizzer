<p>Triticum triunciale subsp.</p>
<p>brachyatherum, commonly known as the short awn wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter awns compared to other wheat species.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences with glumes that are often hairy. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions.</p>
