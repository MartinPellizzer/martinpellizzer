                    <h1>Tetrazygia fuertesii</h1>
<p>Tetrazygia fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetrazygia fuertesii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
