<p>Thalictrum dioicum, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>Thalictrum dioicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
