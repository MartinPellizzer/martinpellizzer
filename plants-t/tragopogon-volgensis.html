<p>Tragopogon volgensis, commonly known as the Hungarian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces a composite flower made up of many small florets, which develop into fluffy, white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.
