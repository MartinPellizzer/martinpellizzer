<p>Trichocline nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined trichocline, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has slender, branching stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a disc-like structure surrounded by bracts.</p>
