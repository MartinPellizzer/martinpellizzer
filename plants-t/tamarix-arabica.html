<p>Tamarix arabica, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, deciduous foliage and small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix arabica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
