<p>Tephroseris palustris subsp.</p>
<p>congesta, commonly known as the marsh tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in bogs and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
