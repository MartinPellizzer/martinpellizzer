                    <h1>Tillandsia kruseana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kruseana, commonly known as the Kruse's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapted to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kruseana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
