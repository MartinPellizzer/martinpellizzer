                    <h1>Triticum kotschyanum</h1>
<p>Triticum kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has been studied for its genetic potential in breeding programs to improve drought resistance in cultivated wheat.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated and remains a minor component in agricultural systems.</p>
