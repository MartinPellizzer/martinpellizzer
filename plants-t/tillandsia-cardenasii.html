                    <h1>Tillandsia cardenasii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia cardenasii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil contact for survival.</p>
