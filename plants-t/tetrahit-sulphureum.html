                    <h1>Tetrahit sulphureum</h1>
<p>Tetrahit sulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur tetrahit, is a mineral rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It is a sulfate mineral composed of lead, sulfur, and oxygen, forming in hydrothermal veins. The mineral is characterized by its yellow to orange color and often exhibits a vitreous luster. It is commonly found in association with other sulfide minerals in ore deposits.</p>
<p>Due to its non-organic nature, it does not participate in botanical processes or plant biology.</p>
