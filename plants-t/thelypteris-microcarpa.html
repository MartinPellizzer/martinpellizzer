<p>Thelypteris microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Thelypteris microcarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
