                    <h1>Thelypteris murkelensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting certain pollinators and aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
