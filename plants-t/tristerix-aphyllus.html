                    <h1>Tristerix aphyllus</h1>
<p>Tristerix aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Australian trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its root-like structures called haustoria, which connect to the host plant. The plant produces small, white, waxy flowers that are often clustered together, and its berries are typically red or yellow, attracting birds for seed dispersal. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological interactions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
