                            <h1>Tragacantha Diluta</h1>
<p>Tragacantha diluta is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils where it plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tragacantha diluta is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
