                    <h1>Tragoceros peucedanifolium</h1>
<p>Tragoceros peucedanifolium, commonly known as the peucedanifolium tragoceros, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the cold, nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
