<p>Trifolium × permixtum, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial legume that belongs to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Trifolium repens (white clover) and Trifolium pratense (red clover), resulting in a plant with variable leaf coloration, often displaying a mix of white, red, and green hues. The trifoliate leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are small, pea-like, and usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This plant is widely used in agriculture for soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop due to its adaptability and nutritional value.</p>
