                    <h1>Thismia winkleri</h1>
<p>Thismia winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and chlorophyll, making it a unique photosynthetic adaptation. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot perform photosynthesis independently.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thismia winkleri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
