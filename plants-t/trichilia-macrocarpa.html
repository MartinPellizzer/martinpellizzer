                    <h1>Trichilia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Trichilia macrocarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local economies.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its decline in some regions, prompting conservation efforts.</p>
