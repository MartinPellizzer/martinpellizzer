                    <h1>Thuja antarctica</h1>
<p>Thuja antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic thuja, is a rare and resilient conifer native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal shape and dense foliage of scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in cold, harsh environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for centuries.</p>
<p>The tree's ability to withstand extreme climates makes it an important subject in botanical studies of adaptation and survival.</p>
