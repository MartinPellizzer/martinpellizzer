<p>Tectaria cadieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, displaying a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Tectaria cadieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
