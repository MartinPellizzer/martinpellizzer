<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal forests or near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
