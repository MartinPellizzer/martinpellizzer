                    <h1>Thelypteris calypso</h1>
<p>Thelypteris calypso, commonly known as the fairy fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
