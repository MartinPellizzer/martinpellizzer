                    <h1>Thymelaea salsa</h1>
<p>Thymelaea salsa, commonly known as the desert thymelaea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Thymelaea salsa is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
