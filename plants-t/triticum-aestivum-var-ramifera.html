                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. ramifera</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. ramifera, commonly known as ramifera wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique branching structure.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a more complex inflorescence compared to standard wheat, with increased ramification in the spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.2 to 1.8 meters, featuring a robust root system that enhances its adaptability to various soil conditions. Its grain is generally smaller and more compact, which can affect milling and baking properties.</p>
<p>Due to its distinct morphology, it is of interest in both agricultural research and botanical studies.</p>
