                    <h1>Thymus × navarroi</h1>
<p>Thymus × navarroi, commonly known as Navarre thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with small, glandular leaves that release a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in both gardens and herbal gardens.</p>
