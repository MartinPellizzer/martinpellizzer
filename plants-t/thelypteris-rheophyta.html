<p>Thelypteris rheophyta, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize suitable habitats effectively. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris rheophyta plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
