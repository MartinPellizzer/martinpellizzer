                    <h1>Trichosalpinx lilliputalis</h1>
<p>Trichosalpinx lilliputalis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered growth habit and strikingly colorful, spurred flowers that typically range from yellow to orange. The plant features a slender, underground rhizome and produces tiny, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
