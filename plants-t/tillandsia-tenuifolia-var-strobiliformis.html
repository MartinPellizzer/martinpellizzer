                    <h1>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. strobiliformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. strobiliformis, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth pattern and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. This coating, known as trichomes, helps the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
