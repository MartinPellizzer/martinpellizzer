<p>Tillandsia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia cucullata is native to Central and South America and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments.</p>
