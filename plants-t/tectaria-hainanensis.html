                    <h1>Tectaria hainanensis</h1>
<p>Tectaria hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan tectaria, is a fern native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria hainanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
