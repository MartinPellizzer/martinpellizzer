<p>Thalictrum nemoralis, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, white, petal-less flowers that bloom in early spring, often emerging through the leaf litter in woodland habitats. The plant has slender, hollow stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Thalictrum nemoralis plays a role in early pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies.</p>
