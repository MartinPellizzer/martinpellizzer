                    <h1>Tillandsia parkeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia parkeri, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, cup-like structure. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This epiphytic plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
