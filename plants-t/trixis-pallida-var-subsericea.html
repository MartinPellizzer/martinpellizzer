                    <h1>Trixis pallida var. subsericea</h1>
<p>Trixis pallida var. subsericea, commonly known as the pale trixis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with grayish-green foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems.</p>
