                    <h1>Tillandsia rusbyi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rusbyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
