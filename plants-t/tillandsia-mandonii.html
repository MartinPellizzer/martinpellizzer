<p>Tillandsia mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia mandonii is well adapted to dry and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
