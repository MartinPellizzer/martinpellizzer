                    <h1>Therolepta</h1>
<p>Therolepta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant features a single, showy white or pale green flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in specific, moist, sandy habitats and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, Therolepta is considered an endangered species.</p>
