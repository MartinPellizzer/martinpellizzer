<p>Tillaea yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tillaea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Tillaea yunnanensis thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
