<p>Taraxacum haptolepium, commonly known as the sticky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its unique features, including the sticky hairs on its stems, help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
