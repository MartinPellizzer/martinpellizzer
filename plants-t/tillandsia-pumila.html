                    <h1>Tillandsia pumila</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pumila, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a small bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pumila is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions.</p>
