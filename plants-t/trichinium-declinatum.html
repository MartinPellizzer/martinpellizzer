                    <h1>Trichinium declinatum</h1>
<p>Trichinium declinatum, commonly known as the leaning trichinium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichinium declinatum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
