                    <h1>Tillandsia zarumensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zarumensis, commonly known as the Zarumense air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
