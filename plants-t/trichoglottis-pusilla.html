<p>Trichoglottis pusilla, commonly known as the miniature lady's tresses, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a delicate, white or pale pink flower spike with numerous tiny, fragrant orchid flowers arranged in a loose raceme. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
