<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, clustered leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of Madagascar's forests.</p>
