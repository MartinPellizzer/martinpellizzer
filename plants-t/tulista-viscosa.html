                    <h1>Tulista viscosa</h1>
<p>Tulista viscosa, commonly known as the sticky tulip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves serve as a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Tulista viscosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
