<p>It is characterized by its compact, densely branched structure and small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environments and a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
