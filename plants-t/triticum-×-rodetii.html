                    <h1>Triticum × rodetii</h1>
<p>Triticum × rodetii, commonly known as the rye-wheat hybrid, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the cross between rye (Secale cereale) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum).</p>
<p>It possesses a genome composed of the combined chromosomes from both parent species, making it a unique genetic resource in plant breeding. This plant is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is often used in research to study gene interactions and to develop new crop varieties with improved traits.</p>
<p>However, it is not cultivated for commercial grain production due to its low yield and poor agronomic performance.</p>
