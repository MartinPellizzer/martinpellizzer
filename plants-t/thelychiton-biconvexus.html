                    <h1>Thelychiton biconvexus</h1>
<p>Thelychiton biconvexus, commonly known as the double-convex thelychiton, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly convex seed pods that give it its scientific name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and shares some morphological traits with its relatives. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
