                    <h1>Tapinanthus platyphyllus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure that allows it to attach to various host species. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, and they can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is native to Africa and is often found growing on shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural concern.</p>
