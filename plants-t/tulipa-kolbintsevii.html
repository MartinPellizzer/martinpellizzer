                    <h1>Tulipa kolbintsevii</h1>
<p>Tulipa kolbintsevii, commonly known as the Kolbintsevii tulip, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is a perennial bulbous plant that blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
