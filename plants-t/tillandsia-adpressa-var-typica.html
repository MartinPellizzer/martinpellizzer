                    <h1>Tillandsia adpressa var. typica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia adpressa var. typica, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
