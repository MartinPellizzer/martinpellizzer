<p>Thyrsacanthus indicus, commonly known as the Indian burr or Indian thistle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animal fur or human clothing. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions.</p>
