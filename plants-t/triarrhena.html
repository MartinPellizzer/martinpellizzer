                    <h1>Triarrhena</h1>
<p>Triarrhena, commonly known as the "three-awn grass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and the presence of awns, which are bristle-like structures on the seed heads. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Triarrhena plants typically thrive in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Their small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to their ability to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
