                    <h1>Tafallaea</h1>
<p>Tafallaea, commonly known as the "false holly," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with slender, unbranched stems and clusters of small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Tafallaea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, some species are considered threatened in the wild.</p>
