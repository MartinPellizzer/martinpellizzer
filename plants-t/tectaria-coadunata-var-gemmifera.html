                    <h1>Tectaria coadunata var. gemmifera</h1>
<p>Tectaria coadunata var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a dark green coloration. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to form gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that aid in its dispersal and establishment in new habitats.</p>
