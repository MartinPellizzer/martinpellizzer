                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. sublarionovii</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. sublarionovii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a rare and ancient grain species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hard seeds and compact growth habit, typically found in rocky or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of florets that contain the edible grains. It is considered a wild relative of modern wheat, offering potential for genetic diversity in breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
