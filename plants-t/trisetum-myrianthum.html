<p>Trisetum myrianthum, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Trisetum myrianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
