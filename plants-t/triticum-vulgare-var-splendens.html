<p>Triticum vulgare var. splendens, commonly known as the golden wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its striking golden hue.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its elongated, awned spikelets and vibrant yellow florets that stand out against the green foliage. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, parallel-veined leaves.</p>
<p>Its seeds, which are harvested for grain, are smaller and more densely packed compared to standard wheat varieties.</p>
