                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. pancicii</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. pancicii, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Fertile Crescent and exhibits a range of genetic diversity that makes it valuable for breeding programs. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with spikelets containing multiple florets. Its botanical features include awned lemmas and a tough, fibrous rachis, which contribute to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is also notable for its potential role in improving the genetic traits of cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
