<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>dicoccoides, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is an ancient grass species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with hard, glume-enclosed grains.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which enhances its drought tolerance. Its genetic diversity is valuable for modern wheat breeding programs due to its resistance traits and adaptation to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is considered a progenitor of domesticated wheat and plays a key role in understanding the evolution of cereal crops.</p>
