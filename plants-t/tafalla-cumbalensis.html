                    <h1>Tafalla cumbalensis</h1>
<p>Tafalla cumbalensis, commonly known as the Cumbal tafalla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
