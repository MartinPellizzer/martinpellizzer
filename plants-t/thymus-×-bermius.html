<p>Thymus × bermius, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, creeping stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves that have a distinct lemony scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Lemon thyme is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and culinary use.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
