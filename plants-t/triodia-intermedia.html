                    <h1>Triodia intermedia</h1>
<p>Triodia intermedia, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, spiky foliage and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks that help stabilize sandy soils. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
<p>Triodia intermedia is also used in traditional Aboriginal land management practices.</p>
