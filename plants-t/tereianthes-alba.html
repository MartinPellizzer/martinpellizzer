The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Tereianthes alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
