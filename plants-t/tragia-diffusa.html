<p>Tragia diffusa, commonly known as the desert tickseed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Tragia diffusa is also known for its ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
