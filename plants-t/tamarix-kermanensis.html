<p>Tamarix kermanensis, commonly known as the Kerman tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions.</p>
<p>Tamarix kermanensis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils, though it can become invasive in some areas.</p>
