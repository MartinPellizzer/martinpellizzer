                    <h1>Tapinanthus lenticellatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus lenticellatus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, creeping growth habit. Its leaves are scale-like and are often mistaken for the host plant's foliage.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems but can be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
