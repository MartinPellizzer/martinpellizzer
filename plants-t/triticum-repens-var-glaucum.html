<p>Triticum repens var. glaucum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions.</p>
