<p>Thelypteris hellwigensis, commonly known as the Hellwig's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris hellwigensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
