                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. strampellii</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. strampellii, commonly known as the Strampellii wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species, distinguished by its compact growth habit and shorter, more rigid spike structure compared to typical hexaploid wheat. The plant exhibits a range of color variations in its glumes and lemma, often displaying red or purple hues. It is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
