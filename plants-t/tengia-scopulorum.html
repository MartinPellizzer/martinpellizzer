                <h1>Tengia scopulorum</h1>
<p>Tengia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or basalt substrates. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tengia scopulorum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
