                    <h1>Tillandsia aeranthos var. rosea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aeranthos var. rosea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking pink or red inflorescences that bloom in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
