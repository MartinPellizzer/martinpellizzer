<p>Tarachia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Tarachia obtusa plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
