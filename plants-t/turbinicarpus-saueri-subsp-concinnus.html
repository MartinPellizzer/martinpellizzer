<p>Turbinicarpus saueri subsp.</p>
<p>concinnus, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Sun," is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
