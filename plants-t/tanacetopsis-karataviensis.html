                    <h1>Tanacetopsis karataviensis</h1>
<p>Tanacetopsis karataviensis, commonly known as the Karatavi tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds similar to those found in tansy, giving it a distinctive scent and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
