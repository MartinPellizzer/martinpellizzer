                    <h1>Taraxacum pumilum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem topped with a spherical cluster of tiny yellow flowers. After flowering, it develops a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator plant for disturbed or nutrient-poor environments.</p>
