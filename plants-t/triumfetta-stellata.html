<p>Triumfetta stellata, commonly known as the starleaf triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Triumfetta stellata is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and open woodlands, and is adapted to thrive in poor soils.</p>
