                            <h1>Telis Ovalis</h1>
<p>Oval telis, scientifically known as Telis ovalis, is a unique and resilient plant species found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its distinctive oval-shaped leaves and compact growth pattern allow it to thrive in harsh environments with minimal water. This plant is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its ability to store moisture makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Despite its hardiness, Telis ovalis faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
