                    <h1>Thalassia antarctica</h1>
<p>Thalassia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic seagrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, temperate to polar waters and forms dense underwater meadows that stabilize sediments and provide habitat for marine life. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, and it reproduces via underwater flowering and seed dispersal. Thalassia antarctica plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration and coastal ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of relatively undisturbed marine environments.</p>
