<p>Tilia × tristis, commonly known as small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Tilia × tristis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
