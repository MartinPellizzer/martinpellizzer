<p>Trifolium arvense var. littorale, commonly known as coastal clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring.
