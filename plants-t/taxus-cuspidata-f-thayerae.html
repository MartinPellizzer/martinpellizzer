<p>Taxus cuspidata f. thayerae, commonly known as the Japanese yew with Thayer's form, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves that are a deep emerald green. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones, typical of the Taxus genus, and is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections.</p>
