                    <h1>Tapinanthus celtidifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus celtidifolius, commonly known as the parasitic plant or the ghost vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants to derive some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a single growing season. It is found in various parts of Africa and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
