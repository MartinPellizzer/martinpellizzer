                <h1>Tapinanthus nigritanus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus nigritanus, commonly known as the black African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure that attaches to its host through specialized haustoria. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs, particularly in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
