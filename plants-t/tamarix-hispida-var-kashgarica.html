<p>Tamarix hispida var. kashgarica, commonly known as the Kashgar tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces fluffy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
