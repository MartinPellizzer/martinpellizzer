                    <h1>Tillandsia edithae var. araucariifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia edithae var. araucariifolia, commonly known as the Araucaria tillandsia, is a rare epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine, hair-like trichomes that aid in water absorption. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a unique addition to tropical indoor gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
