                    <h1>Typha maxima</h1>
<p>Typha maxima, commonly known as the giant cattail, is a tall, aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and it produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically brown or reddish in color. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Typha maxima plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity.</p>
