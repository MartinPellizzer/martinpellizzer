                    <h1>Tribolium pleuropogon</h1>
<p>Tribolium pleuropogon, commonly known as the bluegrass panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Tribolium pleuropogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in native grassland ecosystems.</p>
