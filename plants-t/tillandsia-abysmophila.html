                    <h1>Tillandsia abysmophila</h1>
<p>Tillandsia abysmophila, commonly known as the abyssal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, misty environments where it can capture water through its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus.</p>
