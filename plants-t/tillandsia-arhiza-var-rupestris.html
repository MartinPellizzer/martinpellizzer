                    <h1>Tillandsia arhiza var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Tillandsia arhiza var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that thrives on rocky surfaces, relying on air and rain for moisture rather than soil. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that anchor it to its substrate and aid in water absorption. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow in low-light conditions.</p>
