                    <h1>Tinaea</h1>
<p>Tinaea, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Tinaea species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, inconspicuous fruits called achenes, which are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
