<p>Trichipteris alberti, commonly known as the Albert's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface and form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Trichipteris alberti plays an important ecological role in water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
