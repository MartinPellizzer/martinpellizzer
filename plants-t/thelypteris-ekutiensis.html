                    <h1>Thelypteris ekutiensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris ekutiensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorean holly fern, is a species of fern native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
