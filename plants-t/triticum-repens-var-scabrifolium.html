                    <h1>Triticum repens var. scabrifolium</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. scabrifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved goat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
