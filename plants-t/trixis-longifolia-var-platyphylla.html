                    <h1>Trixis longifolia var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Trixis longifolia var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf trixis, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Trixis longifolia.</p>
