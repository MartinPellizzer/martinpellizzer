<p>Tapinanthus poggei, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It often grows on the stems of other plants, such as Acacia or Euphorbia species.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental flowers make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
