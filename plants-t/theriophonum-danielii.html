                    <h1>Theriophonum danielii</h1>
<p>Theriophonum danielii, commonly known as the Daniel's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions under certain light conditions. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters of small, waxy foliage. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish-white, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Theriophonum danielii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
