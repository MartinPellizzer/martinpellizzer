<p>Thelypteris krameri, commonly known as the Krameri shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Thelypteris krameri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
