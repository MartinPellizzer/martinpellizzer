                            <h1>Tellima Intermedia</h1>
<p>Tellima intermedia is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is known for its unique, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its delicate appearance contrasts with its resilience in harsh alpine conditions. Due to habitat loss, Tellima intermedia is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
