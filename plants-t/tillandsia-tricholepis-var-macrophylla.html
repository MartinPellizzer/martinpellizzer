<p>Tillandsia tricholepis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which bloom after the plant has matured. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
