                    <h1>Tamarix karelinii</h1>
<p>Tamarix karelinii, commonly known as the Persian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink or pale red flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and can help stabilize soil in sandy or saline conditions.</p>
<p>Tamarix karelinii is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with low rainfall.</p>
