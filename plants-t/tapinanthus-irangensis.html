<p>Tapinanthus irangensis, commonly known as the Irang parasol, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. It is often found in forest understories, where it can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
