<p>Tetraria stagnalis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Tetraria stagnalis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic life, with specialized tissues for buoyancy and gas exchange.</p>
