<p>Trichodesma arenicola subsp.</p>
<p>concinnum, commonly known as the coastal trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub with compact, upright growth habit, typically reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, usually from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
