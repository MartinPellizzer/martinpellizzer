<p>Triticum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tough, hull-covered grains that remain attached to the spikelet, distinguishing it from modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets containing multiple florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces achenes as its reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Emmer wheat is notable for its high protein content and has been cultivated for thousands of years in various parts of the world.</p>
