                    <h1>Tectaria diversisora</h1>
<p>Tectaria diversisora, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns.</p>
