                    <h1>Taraxacum detonsum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum detonsum, commonly known as the explosive dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique seed dispersal mechanism.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. Its flower head consists of numerous small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. After flowering, the plant produces a hollow, spiky stem topped with a white, fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is native to Europe and has adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
