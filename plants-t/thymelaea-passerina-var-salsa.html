                    <h1>Thymelaea passerina var. salsa</h1>
<p>Thymelaea passerina var. salsa, commonly known as the saltbush thymelaea, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to saline conditions, making it a hardy species for coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a useful plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
