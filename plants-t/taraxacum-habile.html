                    <h1>Taraxacum habile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum habile, commonly known as the noble dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a feathery pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum habile is noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers.</p>
