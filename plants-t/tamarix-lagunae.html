<p>Tamarix lagunae, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces pink or red flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in dry areas.</p>
<p>Tamarix lagunae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate high salinity.</p>
