<p>Triticum vulgare var. caesium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which develop into seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and potential for forage and erosion control, it has been studied for agricultural and ecological applications.</p>
