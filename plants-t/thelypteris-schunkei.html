                    <h1>Thelypteris schunkei</h1>
<p>Thelypteris schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris schunkei thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb sufficient humidity for its growth.</p>
<p>Its foliage often exhibits a dark green color with a slight waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
