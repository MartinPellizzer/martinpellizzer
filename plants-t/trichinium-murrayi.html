<p>Trichinium murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's trichinium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trichinium murrayi is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional Indigenous Australian medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
