                    <h1>Tetraria borneensis</h1>
<p>Tetraria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tetraria, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant is notable for its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Tetraria borneensis is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem as a food source for certain insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
