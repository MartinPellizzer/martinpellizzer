                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. subaznaburticum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. subaznaburticum, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, often in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh conditions.</p>
