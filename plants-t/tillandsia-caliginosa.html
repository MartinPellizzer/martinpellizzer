                    <h1>Tillandsia caliginosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia caliginosa, commonly known as the cloud forest tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the humid, shaded environments of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots, making it well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
