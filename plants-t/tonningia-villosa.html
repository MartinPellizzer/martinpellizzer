                    <h1>Tonningia villosa</h1>
<p>Tonningia villosa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. Tonningia villosa is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
