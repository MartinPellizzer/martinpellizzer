<p>Trichomanes elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium.</p>
<p>Trichomanes elongatum is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings.</p>
