                    <h1>Thelypteris cheilanthoides var. mucosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris cheilanthoides var. mucosa, commonly known as the mucous holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are often covered in a fine, mucilaginous coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
