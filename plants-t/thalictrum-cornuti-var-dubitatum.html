                    <h1>Thalictrum cornuti var. dubitatum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum cornuti var. dubitatum, commonly known as the uncertain cornut thalictrum, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Berberidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
