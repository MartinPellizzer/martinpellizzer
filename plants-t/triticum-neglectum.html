<p>Triticum neglectum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically brown or yellowish and are often used in traditional agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Triticum neglectum is also considered a weed in cultivated fields, where it can compete with crops for nutrients and water.</p>
