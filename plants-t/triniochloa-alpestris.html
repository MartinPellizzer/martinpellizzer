<p>Triniochloa alpestris, commonly known as the alpine grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a component of high-altitude vegetation communities.</p>
<p>Triniochloa alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
