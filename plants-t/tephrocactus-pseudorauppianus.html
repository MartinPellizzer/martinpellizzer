                    <h1>Tephrocactus pseudorauppianus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus pseudorauppianus, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
