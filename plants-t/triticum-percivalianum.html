                    <h1>Triticum percivalianum</h1>
<p>Triticum percivalianum, commonly known as the Percivalian wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant exhibits a unique genetic makeup that distinguishes it from other wheat species, making it of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable resource for studying wheat evolution and crop diversity.</p>
