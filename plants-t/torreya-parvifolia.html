                    <h1>Torreya parvifolia</h1>
<p>Torreya parvifolia, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches. The plant produces unique, elongated cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Torreya parvifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
