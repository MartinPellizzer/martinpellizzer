<p>Taxotrophis caudata, commonly known as the trailing forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often trail along the ground or hang from trees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Taxotrophis caudata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
