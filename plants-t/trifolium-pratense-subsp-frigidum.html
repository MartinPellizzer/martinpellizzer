<p>Trifolium pratense subsp.</p>
<p>frigidum, commonly known as frost clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subarctic climates.</p>
<p>The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a distinctive white or pale violet bloom. It is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Due to its cold hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in cooler environments.</p>
