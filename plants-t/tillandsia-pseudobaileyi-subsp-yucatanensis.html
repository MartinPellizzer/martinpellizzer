<p>Tillandsia pseudobaileyi subsp.</p>
<p>yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
