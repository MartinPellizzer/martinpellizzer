<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>georgicum, commonly known as Georgian emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that are typically shorter than those of other emmer wheat varieties.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tough grains that are encased in a tough hull, which is a defining feature of the Triticeae tribe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties.</p>
