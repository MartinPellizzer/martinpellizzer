<p>Taeniopetalum arenarium subsp.</p>
<p>neumayeri, commonly known as the Neumayer's sand lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
