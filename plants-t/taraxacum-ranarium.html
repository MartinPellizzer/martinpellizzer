<p>Taraxacum ranarium, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, spiral-shaped seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Taraxacum ranarium is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, lawns, and roadsides.</p>
