<p>Tragacantha haarbachii, commonly known as the Persian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and woody, thorny stems. The plant produces a viscous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to drought include deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces, enabling it to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
