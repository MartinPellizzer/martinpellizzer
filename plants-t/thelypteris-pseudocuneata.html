<p>Thelypteris pseudocuneata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium.
