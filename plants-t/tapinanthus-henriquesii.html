<p>Tapinanthus henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that缠绕 (twine) around host plants. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a short life cycle, typically completing its development within a few months. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
