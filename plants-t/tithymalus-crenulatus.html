<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
