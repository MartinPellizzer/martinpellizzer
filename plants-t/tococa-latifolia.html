                    <h1>Tococa latifolia</h1>
<p>Tococa latifolia, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their stimulating properties, similar to caffeine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
