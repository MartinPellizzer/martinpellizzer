                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides f. major</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides f. major, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives on trees in humid environments.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant's long, hanging strands form dense, cascading clusters that can resemble a green veil. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it grows in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, Spanish moss is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree.</p>
