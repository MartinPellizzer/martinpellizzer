<p>Tamarix minoa, commonly known as the Mediterranean tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces fluffy, pink or pale red flowers that appear in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix minoa is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
