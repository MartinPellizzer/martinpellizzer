<p>Thunbergia anatina, commonly known as the watervine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, trumpet-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and swamps. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover or ornamental vine in humid climates.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
