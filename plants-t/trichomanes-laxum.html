                    <h1>Trichomanes laxum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes laxum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called sori, which are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes laxum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
