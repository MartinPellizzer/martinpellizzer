                    <h1>Torresia fraseri</h1>
<p>Torresia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dark green, leathery foliage and a rough, bark-like texture on its trunk. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Torresia fraseri is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
