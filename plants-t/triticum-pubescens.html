                    <h1>Triticum pubescens</h1>
<p>Triticum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy leaves and spikes, which distinguish it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex inflorescence structure.</p>
<p>Triticum pubescens is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
