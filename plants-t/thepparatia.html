                    <h1>Thepparatia</h1>
<p>Thepparatia, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and showy composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Thepparatia species are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, dry environments. They have adapted to harsh climates through thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers often bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
