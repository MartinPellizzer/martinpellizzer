                    <h1>Tavaresia barklyi</h1>
<p>Tavaresia barklyi, commonly known as the Cape York rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments within coastal rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Tavaresia barklyi is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
