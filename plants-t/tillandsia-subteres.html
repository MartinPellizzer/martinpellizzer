                    <h1>Tillandsia subteres</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subteres, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
