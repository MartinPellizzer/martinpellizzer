                    <h1>Tolpis succulenta var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Tolpis succulenta var. filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spine-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
