<p>Triticum spelta subsp.</p>
<p>yunnanense, commonly known as Yunnan spelt, is a lesser-known wild wheat species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and glumes that are typically shorter than the lemma.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with palea and lemma that are often hairy. Its grains are generally smaller and more elongated compared to cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific environmental conditions.</p>
