                    <h1>Tillandsia caldasiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia caldasiana, commonly known as the Caldasian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
