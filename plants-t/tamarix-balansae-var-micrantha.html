                    <h1>Tamarix balansae var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Tamarix balansae var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf tamarisk, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, erect growth with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces dense clusters of pink to reddish flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it resilient in desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
