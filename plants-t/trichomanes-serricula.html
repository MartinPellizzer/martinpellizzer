<p>Trichomanes serricula, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its small, intricate leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Trichomanes serricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
