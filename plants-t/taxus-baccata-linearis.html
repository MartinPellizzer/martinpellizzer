                    <h1>Taxus baccata linearis</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata linearis, commonly known as the European yew with narrow leaves, is a variant of the common yew.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically darker green than those of the standard Taxus baccata. The plant produces red, fleshy arils surrounding its seeds, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design.</p>
