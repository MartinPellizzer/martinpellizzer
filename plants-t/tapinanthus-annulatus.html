                    <h1>Tapinanthus annulatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus annulatus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants through specialized haustoria, which absorb nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It is native to Africa and parts of the Middle East, growing on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of chlorophyll, it relies entirely on its host for survival.</p>
