                    <h1>Tapinanthus farmari</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus farmari, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, and it often grows in association with other plants in grassland or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a nuisance and a subject of ecological interest in its native range.</p>
