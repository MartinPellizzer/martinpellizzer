                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. arpualtriru</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. arpualtriru, commonly known as the Armenian dwarf wheat, is a small-grained wheat species native to the highlands of Armenia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces dense spikes with small, hard grains that are well adapted to harsh mountainous climates. Its botanical features include narrow leaves, a fibrous root system, and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought tolerance and unique genetic traits.</p>
