                    <h1>Triticum × laxum</h1>
<p>Triticum × laxum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. This plant is closely related to cultivated wheat species and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Triticum × laxum has a complex genetic structure due to its hybrid origin, involving multiple wild wheat species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of wheat evolution and genetics.</p>
