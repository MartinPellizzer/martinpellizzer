<p>Triticum arundinaceum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain the flowering structures. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture.</p>
