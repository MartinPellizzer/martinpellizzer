                    <h1>Trichochloa alpestris</h1>
<p>Trichochloa alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Trichochloa alpestris is an important component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
