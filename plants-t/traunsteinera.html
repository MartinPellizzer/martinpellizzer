                    <h1>Traunsteinera</h1>
<p>Traunsteinera, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, both native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are shrubs characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to red. Traunsteinera species are adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates.</p>
