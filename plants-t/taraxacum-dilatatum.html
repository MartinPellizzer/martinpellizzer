                    <h1>Taraxacum dilatatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum dilatatum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum dilatatum is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas, demonstrating its adaptability to different environments.</p>
