                    <h1>Tillandsia laevis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia laevis, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant does not require soil, as it is an epiphyte, growing on tree branches or rocks.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
