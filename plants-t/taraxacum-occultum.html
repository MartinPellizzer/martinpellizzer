                    <h1>Taraxacum occultum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum occultum, commonly known as the ghost dandelion, is a rare and elusive species of dandelion native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and deeply lobed, hairy leaves that resemble those of other Taraxacum species. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the genus, but its low population density makes it difficult to study. Botanists note its potential ecological significance in certain habitats, though its exact distribution remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this enigmatic plant.</p>
