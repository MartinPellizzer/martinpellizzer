                    <h1>Thelypteris elmerorum</h1>
<p>Thelypteris elmerorum, commonly known as Elmer's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris elmerorum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
