<p>Telipogon boylei, commonly known as the Boyle's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon boylei is considered critically endangered and is subject to conservation efforts.</p>
