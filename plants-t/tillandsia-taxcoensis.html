<p>Tillandsia taxcoensis, commonly known as the Taxco bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Tillandsia taxcoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
