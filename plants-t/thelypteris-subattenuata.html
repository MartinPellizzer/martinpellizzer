<p>Thelypteris subattenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris subattenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
