                    <h1>Tillaea portulacoides</h1>
<p>Tillaea portulacoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Tillaea portulacoides is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
