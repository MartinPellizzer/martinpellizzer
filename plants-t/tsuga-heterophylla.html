<p>Tsuga heterophylla, commonly known as the mountain hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are shorter and more twisted on the lower branches compared to the upper ones. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, often forming dense, dark green forests. Its cones are small and typically hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
