<p>Thamnochortus glaber, commonly known as the naked-stemmed spekboom, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it produces yellowish or white flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Thamnochortus glaber is also known for its ability to fix carbon dioxide through a process called CAM photosynthesis, which helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
