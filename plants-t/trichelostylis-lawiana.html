                    <h1>Trichelostylis lawiana</h1>
<p>Trichelostylis lawiana, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its berries are red and attract birds, which help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it can be harmful to its host tree if it becomes too dense.</p>
