<p>Tillandsia cardenasii var. major, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or red in color.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments.</p>
