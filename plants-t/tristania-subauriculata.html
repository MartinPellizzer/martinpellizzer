                    <h1>Tristania subauriculata</h1>
<p>Tristania subauriculata, commonly known as the Tristania bush, is a shrub native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Tristania subauriculata plays an important ecological role in its isolated ecosystem, supporting local wildlife.</p>
