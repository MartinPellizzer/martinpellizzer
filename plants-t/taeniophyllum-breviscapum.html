                    <h1>Taeniophyllum breviscapum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form with tightly clustered fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and specific environmental conditions to flourish.</p>
