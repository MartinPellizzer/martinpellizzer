                    <h1>Tillandsia leiboldiana var. guttata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia leiboldiana var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
