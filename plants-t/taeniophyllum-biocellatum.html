<p>Taeniophyllum biocellatum, commonly known as the cellular liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed thallus that is often covered with a layer of fine, branched structures called rhizoids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are embedded within the thallus and are involved in sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum biocellatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
