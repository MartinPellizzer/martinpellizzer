                <h1>Tectaria christovalensis</h1>
<p>Tectaria christovalensis, commonly known as the Christoval's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
