<p>Thelypteris leveillei, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across wetland environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Thelypteris leveillei plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
