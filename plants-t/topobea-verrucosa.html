                    <h1>Topobea verrucosa</h1>
<p>Topobea verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf tree, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, thickly foliaged leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>Topobea verrucosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
