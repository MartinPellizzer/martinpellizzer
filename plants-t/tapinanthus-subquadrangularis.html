                    <h1>Tapinanthus subquadrangularis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus subquadrangularis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with yellowish-orange stems that are often angular in cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its roots are specialized for attachment to host plants, allowing it to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
