                    <h1>Taraxacum floccosum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum floccosum, commonly known as the fluffhead dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head, which later develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
