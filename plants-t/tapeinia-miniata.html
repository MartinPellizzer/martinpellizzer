<p>Tapeinia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf rust fungus, is a microscopic plant pathogen that infects various grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fungal kingdom and is characterized by its unique rust-like spore structures. The plant is not a true plant but a parasitic fungus that relies on host plants for survival. It forms distinct pustules on the leaves of its hosts, which contain spores that can spread to new plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized life cycle, it plays a role in natural plant population dynamics.</p>
