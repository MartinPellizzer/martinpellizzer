The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
