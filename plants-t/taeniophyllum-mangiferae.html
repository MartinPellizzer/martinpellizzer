<p>Taeniophyllum mangiferae, commonly known as the mango orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
