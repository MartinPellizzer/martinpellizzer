                    <h1>Taxillus duclouxii</h1>
<p>Taxillus duclouxii, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth or even death of the host tree.</p>
<p>Taxillus duclouxii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting various bird species and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
