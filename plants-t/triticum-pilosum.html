                    <h1>Triticum pilosum</h1>
<p>Triticum pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheat or silky grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Triticum pilosum is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not a major crop.</p>
