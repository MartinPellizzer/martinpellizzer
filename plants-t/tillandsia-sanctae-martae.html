                    <h1>Tillandsia sanctae-martae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Santa Marta Mountains in Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
