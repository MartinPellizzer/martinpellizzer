<p>Thalictrum repens, commonly known as running avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in early spring, often in clusters of three to six.

<p>Thalictrum repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
