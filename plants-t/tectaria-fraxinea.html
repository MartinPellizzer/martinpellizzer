<p>Tectaria fraxinea, commonly known as the fraxinella shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat.</p>
