                    <h1>Triticum tenue</h1>
<p>Triticum tenue, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its seeds are minute and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, Triticum tenue is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and historical significance in early agricultural studies.</p>
