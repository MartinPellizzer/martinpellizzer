<p>Tradescantia commelinoides var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf spiderwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, three-petaled flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground covers, which helps suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion.</p>
