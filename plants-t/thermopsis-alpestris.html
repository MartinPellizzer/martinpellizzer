                    <h1>Thermopsis alpestris</h1>
<p>Thermopsis alpestris, commonly known as alpine thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs.</p>
<p>Thermopsis alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment.</p>
