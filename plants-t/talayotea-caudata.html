<p>Talayotea caudata, commonly known as the coastal spikeweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiky stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in coastal marshes, estuaries, and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Talayotea caudata is an important component of tidal wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
