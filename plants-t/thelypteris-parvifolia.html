<p>Thelypteris parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris parvifolia has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
