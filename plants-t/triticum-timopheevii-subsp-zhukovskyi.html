<p>Triticum timopheevii subsp.</p>
<p>zhukovskyi, commonly known as Zhukovsky's wheatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its short stature and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned glumes and lemma-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience.</p>
