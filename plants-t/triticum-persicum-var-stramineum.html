                    <h1>Triticum persicum var. stramineum</h1>
<p>Triticum persicum var. stramineum, commonly known as Persian wheat or Persian rye, is a perennial grass species native to the mountains of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its seeds are small and have a high nutritional value, making it a potential candidate for forage or grain in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
