                    <h1>Tournesol obliqua</h1>
<p>Tournesol obliqua, commonly known as the crooked sunflower, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical flower heads that deviate from the typical symmetry of other sunflowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its stems are often woody and branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tournesol obliqua is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
