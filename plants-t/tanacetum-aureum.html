<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high content of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or grassy areas.</p>
