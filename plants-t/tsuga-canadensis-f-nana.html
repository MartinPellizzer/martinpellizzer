<p>Tsuga canadensis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that is shorter and more compact than the typical hemlock, giving it a rounded appearance. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces cone-like structures that are typically small and not showy.</p>
<p>This form is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its unique shape and hardy nature.</p>
