                    <h1>Tragacantha porphyrobaphis</h1>
<p>Tragacantha porphyrobaphis, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by inflated pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The gum exuded from its bark has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
