                    <h1>Terpsichore reclinata</h1>
<p>Terpsichore reclinata, commonly known as the reclining dancer's flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in the shaded, moist environments it prefers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
