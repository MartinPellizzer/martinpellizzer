                    <h1>Tillandsia eistetteri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia eistetteri, commonly known as the Eistetter's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps to collect and retain water. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia eistetteri is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
