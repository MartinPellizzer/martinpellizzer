                    <h1>Trillium chloropetalum var. giganteum</h1>
<p>Trillium chloropetalum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant white trillium, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which are often tinged with green. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodland habitats and has a distinctive three-part leaf structure. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest is fully established.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
