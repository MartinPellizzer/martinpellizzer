<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>carthlicum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in tough, straw-like husks, and the plant is often found growing in disturbed soils or along field margins.</p>
<p>Despite its wild nature, it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
