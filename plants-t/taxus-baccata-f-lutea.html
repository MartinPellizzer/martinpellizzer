                    <h1>Taxus baccata f. lutea</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata f. lutea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare and striking variant of the European yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical dark green of the standard Taxus baccata. The plant retains its leaves throughout the year, displaying a vivid yellow hue that intensifies in the autumn. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>This ornamental form is highly valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and slow growth rate.</p>
