<p>Taraxacum persimile, commonly known as the Persian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flowering head.

Native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
