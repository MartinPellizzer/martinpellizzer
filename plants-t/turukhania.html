                    <h1>Turukhania</h1>
<p>Turukhania, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Turukhania is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of desert and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
