<p>Telipogon perlobatus, commonly known as the Perlobatus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis. Its small, white or pale green leaves are adapted for a parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Telipogon perlobatus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting a variety of insect life.</p>
