<p>Trichocentrum caloceras, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are elongated and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum caloceras thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
