                    <h1>Tapinanthus pubiflorus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on various host species such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
