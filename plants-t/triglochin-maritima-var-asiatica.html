<p>Triglochin maritima var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian sea arrowgrass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, thriving in marshy environments along shorelines. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters.
