<p>Tragacantha piestoloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which can be tapped and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Tragacantha piestoloba thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
