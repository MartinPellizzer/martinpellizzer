                    <h1>Tontelea calypso</h1>
<p>Tontelea calypso, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tontelea calypso is considered a conservation concern.</p>
