<p>Trisetum barbinode, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetum barbinode is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
