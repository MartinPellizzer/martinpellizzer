                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × mombergeri</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × mombergeri, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a fascinating succulent that combines the characteristics of its parent species, Turbinicarpus macdowellii and Turbinicarpus calycatus.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. The plant features a compact, rounded stem with a distinctive ribbed structure, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual element. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful watering to avoid root rot and is best suited for experienced growers.</p>
