                    <h1>Timonius minutifolius</h1>
<p>Timonius minutifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf timonius, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its slender stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often hidden among the foliage. Timonius minutifolius thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
