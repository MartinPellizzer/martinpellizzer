<p>Tylanthus empetroides, commonly known as the silverleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
