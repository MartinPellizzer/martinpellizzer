                    <h1>Tinus grisebachiana</h1>
<p>Tinus grisebachiana, commonly known as the Grisebach's tinus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, particularly in South Africa's coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
