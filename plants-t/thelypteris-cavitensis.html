<p>Thelypteris cavitensis, commonly known as the hollow fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hollow fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>Thelypteris cavitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
