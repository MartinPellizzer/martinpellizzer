<p>Tragacantha bludhistana, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of resinous pods. Its sap, known as tragacanth, has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha bludhistana is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
