                    <h1>Tillandsia coarctata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia coarctata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions.</p>
