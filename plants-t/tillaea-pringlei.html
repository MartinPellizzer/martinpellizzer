                    <h1>Tillaea pringlei</h1>
<p>Tillaea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's tillaea, is a rare and endemic plant native to the coastal areas of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to the harsh, salty coastal environment. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle beauty to its rocky habitat. Tillaea pringlei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other coastal flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
