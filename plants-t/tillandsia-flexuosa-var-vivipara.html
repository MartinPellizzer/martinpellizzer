                    <h1>Tillandsia flexuosa var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Tillandsia flexuosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant does not require soil to grow, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to hold water, and it produces offsets that can grow into new plants. The variety vivipara is notable for its ability to produce live young, or "vivipary," where embryos develop inside specialized structures on the mother plant.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for life in humid, shaded environments.</p>
