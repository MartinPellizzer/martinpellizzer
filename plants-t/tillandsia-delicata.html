                    <h1>Tillandsia delicata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia delicata, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its foliage rather than through its roots. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine, silvery coating.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to survive in various microhabitats without requiring soil.</p>
