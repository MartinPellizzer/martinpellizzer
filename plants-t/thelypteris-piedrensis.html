<p>Thelypteris piedrensis, commonly known as the piedrensis shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
