<p>Toumeya peeblesiana, commonly known as the Pebblesian orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
