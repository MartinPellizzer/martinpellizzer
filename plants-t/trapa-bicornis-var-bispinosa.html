                    <h1>Trapa bicornis var. bispinosa</h1>
<p>Trapa bicornis var. bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support the reproductive structures. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bivalved shell, which aids in water dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
