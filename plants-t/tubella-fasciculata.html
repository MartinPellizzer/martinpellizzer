<p>Tubella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered tubular sponge, is a species of sponge that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a marine organism belonging to the phylum Porifera, known for its porous structure that allows water to flow through it. The sponge's body is composed of a fibrous skeleton made of spongin, which provides structural support. It typically forms clusters of small, tube-like structures, giving it its scientific name "fasciculata.".</p>
<p>This species is often found in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems by filtering nutrients from the water.</p>
