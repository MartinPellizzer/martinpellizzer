                    <h1>Trigonachras cuspidata</h1>
<p>Trigonachras cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat.</p>
