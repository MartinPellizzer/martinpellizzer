                    <h1>Taraxacum pachypodum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pachypodum, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces a tall, hairy stem topped with a single, bright yellow flower that blooms in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a fluffy pappus, similar to other dandelions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in drought-prone regions.</p>
