                    <h1>Tillandsia confusa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia confusa, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic appeal, it is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
