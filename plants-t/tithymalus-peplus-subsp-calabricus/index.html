<p>Small white clover, scientifically known as Tithymalus peplus subsp. calabricus, is a low-growing legume commonly found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for agricultural and ecological purposes. Despite its modest appearance, it has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Its adaptability and resilience make it a common sight in many regions around the world.</p>
