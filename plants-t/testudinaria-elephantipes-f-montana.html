<p>Testudinaria elephantipes f. montana, commonly known as the mountain elephant foot.</p>
<p>This variant is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is native to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-draining soil. The plant's unique appearance, with its swollen base resembling an elephant's foot, makes it a striking addition to collections.</p>
<p>It is generally low-maintenance, requiring minimal water and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
