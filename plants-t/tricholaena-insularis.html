<p>Tricholaena insularis, commonly known as the island grass, is a species of grass native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Tricholaena insularis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, providing habitat for small invertebrates and birds.</p>
