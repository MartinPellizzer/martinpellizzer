                    <h1>Tillandsia nicolasensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nicolasensis, commonly known as the Nicolas's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces small, showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nicolasensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
