<p>Telipogon fritillum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a delicate, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns.</p>
<p>Telipogon fritillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
