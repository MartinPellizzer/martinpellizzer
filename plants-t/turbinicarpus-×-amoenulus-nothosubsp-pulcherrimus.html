<p>Turbinicarpus × amoenulus nothosubsp.</p>
<p>pulcherrimus, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Sun," is a hybrid succulent native to the arid regions of the Sonoran Desert. It features a compact, globular stem with a ribbed structure that aids in water storage and reduces surface area for evaporation.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>
