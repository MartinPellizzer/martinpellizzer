                            <h1>Tanacetum Millefolium</h1>
<p>Tanacetum millefolium, commonly known as common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is recognized for its distinctive appearance and historical uses. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent. Despite its benefits, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
