                    <h1>Tapinanthus lecardii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus lecardii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for its nutrients, often attaching to grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus lecardii plays a role in promoting biodiversity by encouraging the growth of certain grasses.</p>
