                    <h1>Thelypteris pullei</h1>
<p>Thelypteris pullei, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in wet soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
