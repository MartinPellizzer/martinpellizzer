                    <h1>Thymus kytlymiensis</h1>
<p>Thymus kytlymiensis, commonly known as Kytlymian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, needle-like leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
