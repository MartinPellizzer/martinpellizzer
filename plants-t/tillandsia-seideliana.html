                    <h1>Tillandsia seideliana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia seideliana, commonly known as the Seidel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to epiphytic life.</p>
<p>Its unique structure allows it to survive in a variety of habitats, including trees and rocky surfaces.</p>
