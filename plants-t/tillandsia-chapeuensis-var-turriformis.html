                    <h1>Tillandsia chapeuensis var. turriformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia chapeuensis var. turriformis, commonly known as the Turban Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, cup-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating that helps retain water.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are small and often pale pink or white, bloom from the center of the rosette and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
