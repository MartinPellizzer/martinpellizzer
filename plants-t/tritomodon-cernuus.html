<p>Tritomodon cernuus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the main photosynthetic function is performed by the stems.</p>
<p>Tritomodon cernuus is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladder-like traps to capture and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
