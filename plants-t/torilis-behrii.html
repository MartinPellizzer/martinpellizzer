                    <h1>Torilis behrii</h1>
<p>Torilis behrii, commonly known as the common sandbur, is an annual flowering plant native to Eurasia and parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Torilis behrii is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
