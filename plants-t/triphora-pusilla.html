<p>Triphora pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the stems of various oak trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which invade the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to some animals, are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Triphora pusilla is an important part of the ecosystem, influencing the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
