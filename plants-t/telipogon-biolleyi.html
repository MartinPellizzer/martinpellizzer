                    <h1>Telipogon biolleyi</h1>
<p>Telipogon biolleyi, commonly known as the Boll√©'s grass, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Telipogon biolleyi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the adaptation strategies of high-altitude flora.</p>
