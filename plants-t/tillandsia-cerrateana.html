                    <h1>Tillandsia cerrateana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cerrateana, commonly known as the Cerrado airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ability to absorb water through its leaves makes it a unique example of adaptation in the botanical world.</p>
