                    <h1>Tectaria coriacea</h1>
<p>Tectaria coriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Tectaria coriacea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, indirect light conditions.</p>
