<p>Triainolepis sancta, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of venation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are intricately adapted to its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Triainolepis sancta is considered a conservation concern.</p>
