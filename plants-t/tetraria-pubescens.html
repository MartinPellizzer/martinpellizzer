                    <h1>Tetraria pubescens</h1>
<p>Tetraria pubescens, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety growth and a pale to bright green or yellowish color. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which provides the plant with nutrients. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
