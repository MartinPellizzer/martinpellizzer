<p>Tillandsia cyanescens, commonly known as the blue tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.

It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue.</p>
<p>Tillandsia cyanescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
