<p>Trichomanes pervenulosum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Trichomanes pervenulosum is notable for its ability to grow on rocks and tree trunks, making it an epiphytic species.</p>
