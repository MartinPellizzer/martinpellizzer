                    <h1>Tillandsia melanopus</h1>
<p>Tillandsia melanopus, commonly known as the black-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia melanopus is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
