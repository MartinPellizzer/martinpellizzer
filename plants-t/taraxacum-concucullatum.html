                    <h1>Taraxacum concucullatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum concucullatum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, elongated flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its seed dispersal mechanism involves a distinctive, parachute-like pappus that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
