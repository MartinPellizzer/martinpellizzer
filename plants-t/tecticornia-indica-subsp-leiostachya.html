<p>Tecticornia indica subsp.</p>
<p>leiostachya, commonly known as the coastal spinifex grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to coastal regions of Australia and thrives in sandy soils with high salt content.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
