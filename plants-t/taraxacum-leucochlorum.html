<p>Taraxacum leucochlorum, commonly known as the dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous small yellow florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum leucochlorum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its diuretic and digestive benefits.</p>
