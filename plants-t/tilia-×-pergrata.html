                    <h1>Tilia × pergrata</h1>
<p>Tilia × pergrata, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are typically 4–8 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round, brown fruits. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
