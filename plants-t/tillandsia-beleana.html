                    <h1>Tillandsia beleana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia beleana, commonly known as the Belean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with colorful, bell-shaped flowers that typically range from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
