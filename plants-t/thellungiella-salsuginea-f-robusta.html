<p>Thellungiella salsuginea f. robusta, commonly known as the desert windowweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant exhibits remarkable tolerance to high salinity and drought, making it a model organism for studying stress responses in plants. Its small, green leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This frost-tolerant species is native to Central Asia and is used in both horticultural and scientific research contexts.</p>
