                    <h1>Tepuianthus aracensis</h1>
<p>Tepuianthus aracensis, commonly known as the Arac√° beauty, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, adapting to the unique environmental conditions of the tepui landscape. Its leaves are usually broad and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in the arid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tepuianthus aracensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
