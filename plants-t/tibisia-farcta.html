<p>Tibisia farcta, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in spring. Tibisia farcta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species.</p>
