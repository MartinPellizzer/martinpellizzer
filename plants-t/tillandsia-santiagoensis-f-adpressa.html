                    <h1>Tillandsia santiagoensis f. adpressa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia santiagoensis f. adpressa, commonly known as the Santiagoensis Tillandsia, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a compact rosette, allowing it to efficiently capture moisture from the air. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, adding to its subtle beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
