                    <h1>Thelypteris glanduligera var. puberula</h1>
<p>Thelypteris glanduligera var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It typically has a short, creeping rhizome and produces fertile fronds that are usually shorter than the sterile ones. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving the plant its "hairy" appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
