<p>Thelypteris pustulosa, commonly known as the blister fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its reproductive cycle involves the release of spores, which germinate into gametophytes, completing the alternation of generations.</p>
