<p>Taxanthema ferulaceum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Taxanthema ferulaceum is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
