                    <h1>Tillandsia clavigera var. pendula</h1>
<p>Tillandsia clavigera var. pendula, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant stems that can reach up to several feet in length, supporting clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots, making it well-suited for air planting.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
