                    <h1>Trigonidium subrepens</h1>
<p>Trigonidium subrepens, commonly known as the creeping trigonidium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Trigonidium subrepens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
