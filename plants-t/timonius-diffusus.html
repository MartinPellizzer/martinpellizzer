<p>Timonius diffusus, commonly known as the spreading timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Timonieae tribe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance, and are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
