<p>Tragacantha farcta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap, which is harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha farcta is valued for its resilience to drought and its role in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
