<p>Thelypteris arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as sandstone outcrops and woodland edges. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its leaves are typically divided into small, rounded segments. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>Thelypteris arenicola is an indicator species for dry, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing rocky environments.</p>
