                    <h1>Triticum accessorium</h1>
<p>Triticum accessorium, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to true wheat species but lacks the economic importance of cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
