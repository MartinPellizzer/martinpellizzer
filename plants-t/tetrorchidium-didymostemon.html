                    <h1>Tetrorchidium didymostemon</h1>
<p>Tetrorchidium didymostemon, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive two-lobed structure, typically in shades of white and pink. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
