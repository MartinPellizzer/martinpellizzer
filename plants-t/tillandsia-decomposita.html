                    <h1>Tillandsia decomposita</h1>
<p>Tillandsia decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia decomposita is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
