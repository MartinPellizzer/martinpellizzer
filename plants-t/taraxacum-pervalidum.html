<p>Taraxacum pervalidum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its propagation across mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum pervalidum is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
