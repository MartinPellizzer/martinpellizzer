<p>Turbinicarpus paoloi, commonly known as the Paul's Turbinicarpus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Turbinicarpus paoloi is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
