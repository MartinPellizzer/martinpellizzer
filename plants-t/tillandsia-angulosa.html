                    <h1>Tillandsia angulosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia angulosa, commonly known as the angular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
