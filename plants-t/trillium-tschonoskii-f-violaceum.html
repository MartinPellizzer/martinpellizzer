                    <h1>Trillium tschonoskii f. violaceum</h1>
<p>Trillium tschonoskii f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features a single, showy violet or purple flower that emerges from a whorl of three broadly elliptic leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant produces red or orange berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
