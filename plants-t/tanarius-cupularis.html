                    <h1>Tanarius cupularis</h1>
<p>Tanarius cupularis, commonly known as the hooded lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like thallus structure, which provides a habitat for the photosynthetic partner. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
