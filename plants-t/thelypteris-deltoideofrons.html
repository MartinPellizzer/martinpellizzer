<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
