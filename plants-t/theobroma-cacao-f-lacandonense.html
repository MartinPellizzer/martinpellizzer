                    <h1>Theobroma cacao f. lacandonense</h1>
<p>Theobroma cacao f. lacandonense, commonly known as the Lacandon cocoa, is a botanical variant of the cacao tree native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated pods that contain bitter, high-cocoa-content beans. This form is often considered a wild relative of the cultivated cacao varieties, contributing to genetic diversity in breeding programs. Its leaves are typically larger and more leathery compared to those of the standard cacao tree.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
