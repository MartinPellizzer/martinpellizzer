                    <h1>Tabebuia ipe</h1>
<p>Tabebuia ipe, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, peeling bark that reveals a vibrant red or orange inner layer. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Its wood is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich color, making it a prized material in musical instruments and fine woodworking.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
