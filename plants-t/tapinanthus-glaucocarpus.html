                    <h1>Tapinanthus glaucocarpus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus glaucocarpus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract resources.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
