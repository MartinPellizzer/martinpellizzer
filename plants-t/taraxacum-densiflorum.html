                    <h1>Taraxacum densiflorum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
