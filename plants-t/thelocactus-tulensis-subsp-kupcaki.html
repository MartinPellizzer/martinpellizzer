<p>Thelocactus tulensis subsp.</p>
<p>kupcaki, commonly known as the Kupcaki thorned cactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
