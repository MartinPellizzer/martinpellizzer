<p>Triadica sebifera, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of 11 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that disperse seeds via wind.
