                    <h1>Tristemon</h1>
<p>Tristemon, commonly known as the "false thornapple," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. They produce showy, tubular flowers that are usually brightly colored, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats.</p>
