                    <h1>Trillium grandiflorum var. macropetalum</h1>
<p>Trillium grandiflorum var. macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled trillium, is a striking member of the Trilliaceae family native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, three-petaled flowers that are typically larger and more prominently colored than those of the typical Trillium grandiflorum. The plant features three broad, waxy leaves that are often marked with distinct veins, and it thrives in shaded, moist woodlands. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, usually between April and May, adding a vibrant touch to the forest floor.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant landscapes.</p>
