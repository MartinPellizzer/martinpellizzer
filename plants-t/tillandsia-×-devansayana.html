                    <h1>Tillandsia × devansayana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × devansayana, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a hybrid air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking silver-gray foliage and occasional pink or purple flowers make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
