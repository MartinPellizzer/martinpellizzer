                    <h1>Thalictrum foetidum var. stipellatum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum foetidum var. stipellatum, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant or unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The variety stipellatum is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of T. foetidum.</p>
