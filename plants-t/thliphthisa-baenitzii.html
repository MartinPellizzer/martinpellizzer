                    <h1>Thliphthisa baenitzii</h1>
<p>Thliphthisa baenitzii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
