                    <h1>Triticum rufinflatum</h1>
<p>Triticum rufinflatum, commonly known as the red flat wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, flattened spikelets and reddish glumes, which distinguish it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates and has small, narrow leaves. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and crop improvement.</p>
