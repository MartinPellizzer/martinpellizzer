<p>Trichomanes niveum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a silvery-white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Trichomanes niveum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance.</p>
