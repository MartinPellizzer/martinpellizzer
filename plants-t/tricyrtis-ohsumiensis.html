<p>Tricyrtis ohsumiensis, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tricyrtis ohsumiensis is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
