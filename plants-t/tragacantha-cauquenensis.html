                    <h1>Tragacantha cauquenensis</h1>
<p>Tragacantha cauquenensis, commonly known as the Andean tragacanth, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, similar to other members of the Astragalus genus, which has been used traditionally in local medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
