<p>Thelypteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its expansive foliage. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris gigantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests and along stream banks.</p>
