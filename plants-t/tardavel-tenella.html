                    <h1>Tardavel tenella</h1>
<p>Tardavel tenella, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Tardavel tenella is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped prey for additional nutrients in nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
