                    <h1>Tritonia flabellifolia var. thomasiae</h1>
<p>Tritonia flabellifolia var. thomasiae, commonly known as Thomas's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, often with a distinctive white throat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
