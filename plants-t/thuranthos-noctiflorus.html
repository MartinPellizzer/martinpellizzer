                    <h1>Thuranthos noctiflorus</h1>
<p>Thuranthos noctiflorus, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of southern Veridia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals that open only under moonlight, a trait that has made it a subject of fascination among botanists and herbalists. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to access nutrients from the rich, loamy soil.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Thuranthos noctiflorus is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
