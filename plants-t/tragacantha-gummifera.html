                    <h1>Tragacantha gummifera</h1>
<p>Tragacantha gummifera, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-bark and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Tragacantha gummifera is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
