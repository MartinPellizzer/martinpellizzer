                            <h1>Teline Orientalis</h1>
<p>Oriental teline, scientifically known as Teline orientalis, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This delicate species belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, yet it remains largely overlooked by the general public. Its slender stems and small, pale flowers make it a subtle yet striking addition to alpine ecosystems. Despite its beauty, Teline orientalis faces significant threats from habitat loss and climate change. Understanding and protecting this unique plant is crucial for preserving biodiversity in its native environment.</p>
