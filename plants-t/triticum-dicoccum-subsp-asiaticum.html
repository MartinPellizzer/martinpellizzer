<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>asiaticum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescence with small, glumeless spikelets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its grains are hulless, meaning they lack the hard outer hull found in other barley varieties.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its use in traditional and modern agriculture, as well as in brewing and food products.</p>
