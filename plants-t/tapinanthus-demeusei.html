                    <h1>Tapinanthus demeusei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus demeusei, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that facilitate its parasitic lifestyle. It typically attaches to the stems or roots of other plants, such as grasses or shrubs, and can significantly weaken its host.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in some regions where it grows.</p>
