                    <h1>Tillandsia aeranthos var. alba</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aeranthos var. alba, commonly known as the white air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
