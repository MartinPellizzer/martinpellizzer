<p>Thelypteris sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris sclerophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
