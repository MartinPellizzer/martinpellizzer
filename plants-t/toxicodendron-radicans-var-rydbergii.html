                    <h1>Toxicodendron radicans var. rydbergii</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans var. rydbergii, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous vine or shrub that typically grows in woodland areas and along streambanks. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with smooth or slightly notched edges. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact.</p>
<p>This variant is often mistaken for other similar species but can be distinguished by its leaf structure and growth habits.</p>
