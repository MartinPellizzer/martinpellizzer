                    <h1>Taraxacum subnefrens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subnefrens, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of stiff, hairy, and often blue-green leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in early summer, followed by a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or high-altitude environments.</p>
