<p>Trifolium amabile var. longifoliolum, commonly known as the long-leaved clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its elongated, slender leaves.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and white, often forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, which is a defining feature of the genus Trifolium.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
