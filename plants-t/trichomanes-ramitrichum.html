<p>Trichomanes ramitrichum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cone-like formations.</p>
<p>Trichomanes ramitrichum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
