The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
