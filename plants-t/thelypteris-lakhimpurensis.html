                    <h1>Thelypteris lakhimpurensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
