                    <h1>Triticum durum var. falcataffine</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. falcataffine, commonly known as durum wheat variant falcataffine, is a botanical variant of durum wheat, characterized by its unique genetic traits.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for producing strong dough used in pasta and semolina. The plant exhibits a robust growth habit with semi-dwarf stalks, making it suitable for high-yield agricultural practices. It typically flowers and matures earlier than standard durum wheat, adapting well to temperate climates.</p>
<p>The grain is hard and has a high protein content, contributing to its versatility in food processing.</p>
