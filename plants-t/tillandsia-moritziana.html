                    <h1>Tillandsia moritziana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
