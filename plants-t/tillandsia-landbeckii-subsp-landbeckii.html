<p>Tillandsia landbeckii subsp.</p>
<p>landbeckii, commonly known as the Landbeck's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces inflorescences with striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
