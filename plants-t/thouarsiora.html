                    <h1>Thouarsiora</h1>
<p>Thouarsiora, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique and often striking floral structures. The plants typically feature showy, brightly colored flowers with intricate patterns, which attract specific pollinators. Thouarsiora species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species within this genus are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
