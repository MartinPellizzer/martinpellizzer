                    <h1>Triticum biflorum var. hornemannii</h1>
<p>Triticum biflorum var. hornemannii, commonly known as the hornemannii wheatgrass, is a rare and little-known variant of the wheatgrass genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive two-flowered spikelets, which set it apart from other wheatgrass species. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced under stress.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
