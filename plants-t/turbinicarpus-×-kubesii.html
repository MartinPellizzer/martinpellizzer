<p>Turbinicarpus × kubesii, commonly known as the hybrid turbinicarpus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its hybrid origin results from the cross between Turbinicarpus macdowellii and Turbinicarpus callosus, giving it unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
