                    <h1>Tillandsia spiculosa var. ustulata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spiculosa var. ustulata, commonly known as the black-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with dark purple or black tips, which give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are typically pale green or white, are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
