<p>Tuberaria inconspicua var. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Galicia, Spain.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for maritime ecosystems.</p>
