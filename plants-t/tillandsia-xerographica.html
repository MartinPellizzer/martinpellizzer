                    <h1>Tillandsia xerographica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia xerographica, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its spongy, scale-like leaves. Its unique structure allows it to attach to trees and other surfaces without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of foliage that give it a distinctive, moss-like appearance.</p>
