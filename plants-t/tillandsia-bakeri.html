                    <h1>Tillandsia bakeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing and retaining water. It produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
