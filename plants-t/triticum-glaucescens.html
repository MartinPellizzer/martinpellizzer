<p>Triticum glaucescens, commonly known as the gray wheat or glaucous wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bluish-gray leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is a diploid species with a genome size typical of other wheat species, and it has been studied for its potential in genetic research.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
