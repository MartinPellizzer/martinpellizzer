<p>Tectaria leuzeana, commonly known as the Zonaria fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Tectaria leuzeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
