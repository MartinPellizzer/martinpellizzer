                    <h1>Thecacoris obanensis</h1>
<p>Thecacoris obanensis, commonly known as the Oban lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen that thrives in specific, often remote, habitats.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, which together form a unique structure known as a thallus. The plant is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces such as rock or soil. It is typically found in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous or coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
