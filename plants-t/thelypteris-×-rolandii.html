<p>Thelypteris × rolandii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris acutifolia and Thelypteris hespera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories across the southeastern United States. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Thelypteris × rolandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its lush, evergreen foliage.</p>
