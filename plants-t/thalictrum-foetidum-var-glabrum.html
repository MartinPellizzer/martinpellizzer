                    <h1>Thalictrum foetidum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum foetidum var. glabrum, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-tick, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Thalictrum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its subtle appearance and strong scent, it is sometimes overlooked but plays a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
