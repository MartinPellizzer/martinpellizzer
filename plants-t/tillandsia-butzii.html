                    <h1>Tillandsia butzii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia butzii, commonly known as the Butzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Tillandsia butzii is well adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
