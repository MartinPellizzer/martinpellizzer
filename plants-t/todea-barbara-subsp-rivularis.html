<p>Todea barbara subsp.</p>
<p>rivularis, commonly known as the rivularis todea, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in southern Africa. It typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters, making it an indicator species for clean water habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
