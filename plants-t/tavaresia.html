                    <h1>Tavaresia</h1>
<p>Tavaresia, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers. Tavaresia species typically have smooth, glossy leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic compounds. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and open fields.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, they are generally avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>
