<p>Trochetia contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Trochetia contracta is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
