<p>Taraxacum palustre subsp.</p>
<p>crocinum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via lightweight, parachute-like structures called pappi.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native wetland environments.</p>
