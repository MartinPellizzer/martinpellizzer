<p>Timonius subcoriaceus var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile-leaved timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
