<p>Trichipteris nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichipteris nigripes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
