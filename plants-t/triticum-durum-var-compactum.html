                    <h1>Triticum durum var. compactum</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. compactum, commonly known as durum wheat compactum, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stalks.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. The plant typically exhibits a semi-dwarf stature, which can improve lodging resistance and facilitate mechanized harvesting. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a moderate amount of rainfall during its growing season.</p>
<p>The compact growth form also contributes to higher yield potential per unit area compared to other wheat varieties.</p>
