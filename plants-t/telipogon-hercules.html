                    <h1>Telipogon hercules</h1>
<p>Telipogon hercules, commonly known as the Hercules orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the remote and rugged terrain of New Zealand.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its striking, sword-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can survive in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Telipogon hercules is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
