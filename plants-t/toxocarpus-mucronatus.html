<p>Toxocarpus mucronatus, commonly known as the blunt-fruited spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spherical, greenish-gray fruits that mature to a reddish color. Its foliage and stems contain milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Toxocarpus mucronatus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
