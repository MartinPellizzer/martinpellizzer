                    <h1>Trisetum rosei</h1>
<p>Trisetum rosei, commonly known as the roseless false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, pale green to brownish flowers. Trisetum rosei thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some gardens, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
