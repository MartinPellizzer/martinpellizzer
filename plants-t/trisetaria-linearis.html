<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its small stature and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
