                    <h1>Taxus pedunculata</h1>
<p>Taxus pedunculata, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark, which becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into blue-black berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its wood is also historically used for crafting items such as bows and furniture due to its strength and durability.</p>
