                    <h1>Taraxacum perpusillum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, small yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem and has a fibrous root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other dandelion species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit.</p>
