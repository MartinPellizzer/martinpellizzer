                    <h1>Tripolium andinum</h1>
<p>Tripolium andinum, commonly known as the Andean tripolium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are often finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Tripolium andinum is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
