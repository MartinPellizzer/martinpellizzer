<p>Trisetum spicatum subsp.</p>
<p>cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Trisetum spicatum.</p>
