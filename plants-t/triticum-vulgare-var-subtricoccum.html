                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. subtricoccum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. subtricoccum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a variant of barley characterized by the absence of the awns on its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three-rowed, glumeless florets. The grains are typically smaller and more delicate than those of hulled barley, making it suitable for certain food and brewing applications.</p>
<p>It is also valued in ecological agriculture for its ability to thrive in marginal soils.</p>
