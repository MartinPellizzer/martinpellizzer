<p>Tontelea richardii, commonly known as the Richard's tontelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tontelea richardii is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
