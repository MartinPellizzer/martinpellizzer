                    <h1>Tectaria morata</h1>
<p>Tectaria morata, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a rugged texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Tectaria morata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
