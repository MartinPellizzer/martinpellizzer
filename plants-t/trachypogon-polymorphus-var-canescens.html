<p>Trachypogon polymorphus var. canescens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are clustered in a loose, open arrangement.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its hairy, bluish-green leaves and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
