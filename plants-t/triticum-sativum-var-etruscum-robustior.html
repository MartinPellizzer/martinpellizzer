<p>Triticum sativum var. etruscum-robustior, commonly known as the Etruscan robust wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its robust growth habit and increased stem thickness.</p>
<p>This variety is typically found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to withstand moderate drought conditions. It possesses a high gluten content, making it suitable for bread-making and other wheat-based products. The plant exhibits a spikelet structure with awns, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
