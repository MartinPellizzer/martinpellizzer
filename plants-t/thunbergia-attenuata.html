<p>Thunbergia attenuata, commonly known as the slender moonvine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vine-like growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
