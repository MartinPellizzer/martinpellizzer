<p>Thelocactus leucacanthus var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's white spined cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
