                    <h1>Trigonella orthoceras var. baylissiae</h1>
<p>Trigonella orthoceras var. baylissiae, commonly known as the Bayliss's fenugreek, is a rare variant of the fenugreek plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical features include hairy stems and seed pods that split open to release its tiny, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
