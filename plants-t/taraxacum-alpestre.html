                    <h1>Taraxacum alpestre</h1>
<p>Taraxacum alpestre, commonly known as alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Taraxacum alpestre is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
