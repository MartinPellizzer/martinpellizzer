                    <h1>Trichomanes hibernicum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes hibernicum, commonly known as the Irish maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Ireland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the more common maidenhair ferns. This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes hibernicum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
