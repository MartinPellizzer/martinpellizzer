                    <h1>Tauschia spellenbergii</h1>
<p>Tauschia spellenbergii, commonly known as the Spitzkopf, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
