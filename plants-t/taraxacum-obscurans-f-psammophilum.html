<p>It exhibits a compact growth form with reduced leaf size and a shorter stem to minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
