                    <h1>Topobea rhodantha</h1>
<p>Topobea rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Topobea rhodantha is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
