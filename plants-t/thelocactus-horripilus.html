The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise stark appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
