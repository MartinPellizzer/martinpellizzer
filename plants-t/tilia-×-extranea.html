                    <h1>Tilia × extranea</h1>
<p>Tilia × extranea, commonly known as the European lime or small-leaved lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across Europe.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance.</p>
