                    <h1>Tamarix gracilis</h1>
<p>Tamarix gracilis, commonly known as the slender tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or reddish flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Tamarix gracilis is drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it a common species in desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it ecologically significant in arid ecosystems.</p>
