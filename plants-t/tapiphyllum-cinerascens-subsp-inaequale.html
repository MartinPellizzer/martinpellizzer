<p>Tapiphyllum cinerascens subsp.</p>
<p>inaequale, commonly known as the unequal tapiphyllum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring asymmetrical lobes that distinguish it from other members of the genus.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests, where it relies on high humidity and nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow to greenish hue, which contributes to its ecological role in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
