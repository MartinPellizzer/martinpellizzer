                    <h1>Tapinanthus schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus schweinfurthii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
