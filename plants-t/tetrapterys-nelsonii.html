                    <h1>Tetrapterys nelsonii</h1>
<p>Tetrapterys nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or greenish-white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to its parasitic lifestyle and ecological niche within forest ecosystems.</p>
