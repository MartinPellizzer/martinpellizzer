<p>Turanga ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Turanga ilicifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
