                    <h1>Tillandsia koideae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia koideae, commonly known as the Koide's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia koideae is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
