<p>Tricholaena congoensis, commonly known as the Congo grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale green flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Tricholaena congoensis is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are fibrous and have been used traditionally for thatching and other local crafts.</p>
