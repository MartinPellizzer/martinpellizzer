                    <h1>Tubutubua</h1>
<p>Tubutubua, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a unique plant native to parts of Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or white.</p>
<p>Tubutubua is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional healing practices.</p>
