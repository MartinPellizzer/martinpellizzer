                    <h1>Tillandsia quadripinnata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant produces striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can efficiently capture water and nutrients.</p>
