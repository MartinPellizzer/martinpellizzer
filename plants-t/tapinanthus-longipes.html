                    <h1>Tapinanthus longipes</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to arid regions of Africa and is often found parasitizing shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
