<p>Tillandsia appenii, commonly known as the Appenine air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale purple or white flowers.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
