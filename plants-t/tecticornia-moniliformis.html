                    <h1>Tecticornia moniliformis</h1>
<p>Tecticornia moniliformis, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Tecticornia moniliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native fauna.</p>
