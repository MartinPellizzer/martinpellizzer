                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × camelliflorus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × camelliflorus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a unique combination of two distinct cactus species.</p>
<p>It features a colorful, non-photosynthetic upper portion called the "pseudostem" that sits atop a green, photosynthetic base known as the "stock.". The plant is native to the arid regions of Mexico and is prized for its vibrant, often multicolored flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds.</p>
