<p>Trifolium wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral habitats. The plant is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
