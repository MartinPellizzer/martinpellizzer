<p>Tirucalia enterophora, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
