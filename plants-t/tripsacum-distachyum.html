<p>Tripsacum distachyum, commonly known as wild maize or bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>

The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are often arranged in pairs. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
