<p>Tunica arenicola, commonly known as the sand-tunic or sand-dweller, is a unique plant species adapted to harsh, sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, shifting sands.</p>
<p>Tunica arenicola plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal and desert regions.</p>
