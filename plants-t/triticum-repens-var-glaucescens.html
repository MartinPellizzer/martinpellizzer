                    <h1>Triticum repens var. glaucescens</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. glaucescens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its scientific name "glaucescens," meaning "blue-gray.". The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
