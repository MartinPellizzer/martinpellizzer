<p>Thelypteris bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris bakeri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
