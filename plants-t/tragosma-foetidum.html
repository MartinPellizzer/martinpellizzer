                    <h1>Tragosma foetidum</h1>
<p>Tragosma foetidum, commonly known as the stink vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that produces small, fragrant flowers, though the plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its pungent scent makes it less desirable in cultivated settings.</p>
