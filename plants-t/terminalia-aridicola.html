                    <h1>Terminalia aridicola</h1>
<p>Terminalia aridicola, commonly known as the desert terminalia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Terminalia aridicola is adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it resilient in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to survive in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
