                    <h1>Triticum vavilovii</h1>
<p>Triticum vavilovii, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a diploid grass with a genome size of approximately 16.1 gigabases, making it a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence, which contains small, glumeless florets. Triticum vavilovii is closely related to domesticated wheat and has been used in breeding programs to enhance traits such as disease resistance and yield.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader understanding of wheat evolution and adaptation.</p>
