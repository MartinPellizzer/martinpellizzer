                    <h1>Trigonia costanensis</h1>
<p>Trigonia costanensis, commonly known as the coastal trigonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Trigonia costanensis is valued for its resilience and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
