                    <h1>Triticum ciliatum</h1>
<p>Triticum ciliatum, commonly known as the slender wheat or silky wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to beige florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum ciliatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and ecological role in various habitats.</p>
