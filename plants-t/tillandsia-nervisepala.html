                    <h1>Tillandsia nervisepala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nervisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
