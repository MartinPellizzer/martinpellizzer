                    <h1>Trichosporum caudatum</h1>
<p>Trichosporum caudatum, commonly known as the hairy beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy thallus that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on bark and soil in temperate regions, preferring shaded and moist environments.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a leathery upper layer and a loosely branched lower layer, which helps in water retention and protection against desiccation.</p>
