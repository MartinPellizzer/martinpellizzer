                    <h1>Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoalboglabrum</h1>
<p>Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudoalboglabrum, commonly known as the white glabrous wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It exhibits a compact, spherical growth habit, with small, rounded spikelets that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence is tightly clustered, and the grains are small and hard, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
