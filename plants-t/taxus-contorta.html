                    <h1>Taxus contorta</h1>
<p>Taxus contorta, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and parts of Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rounded crown. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, often peeling in thin, flaky layers.</p>
<p>Taxus contorta is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts.</p>
