                    <h1>Tamarix senegalensis</h1>
<p>Tamarix senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for dune fixation.</p>
<p>Tamarix senegalensis is also valued for its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils.</p>
