                    <h1>Tylomium</h1>
<p>Tylomium, commonly known as the "false broomrape," is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. Its structure is characterized by a swollen base called the haustorium, which penetrates the host's vascular system. Tylomium species are often found in temperate regions and can be invasive in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in ecological interactions and can impact crop yields.</p>
