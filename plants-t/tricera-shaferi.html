                    <h1>Tricera shaferi</h1>
<p>Tricera shaferi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. Its botanical classification places it in the Orchidaceae family, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited range, Tricera shaferi is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
