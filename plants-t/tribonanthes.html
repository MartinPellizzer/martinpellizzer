                    <h1>Tribonanthes</h1>
<p>Tribonanthes, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Tribonanthes species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They have a fibrous root system that helps them retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
