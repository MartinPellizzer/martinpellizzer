                    <h1>Thalictrum dioicum var. coriaceum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum dioicum var. coriaceum, commonly known as the rough meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and woodland edges in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem with alternate, palmately compound leaves that have a distinctive rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clustered racemes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants, a characteristic that influences its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>The rough meadow rue is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
