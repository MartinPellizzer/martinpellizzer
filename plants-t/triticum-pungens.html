<p>Triticum pungens, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Triticum pungens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
