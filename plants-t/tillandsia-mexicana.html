                    <h1>Tillandsia mexicana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
