<p>Tydaea warszewiczii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in saline soils and can thrive in coastal or desert regions.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
