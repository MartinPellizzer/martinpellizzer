                    <h1>Tertrea</h1>
<p>Tertrea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, ephemeral blooms that appear only at night. The plant's flowers are pale purple or white, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Tertrea is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its rare flowering pattern and ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
