                    <h1>Telipogon steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Telipogon steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, hairy stem and a single, showy orchid flower with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
