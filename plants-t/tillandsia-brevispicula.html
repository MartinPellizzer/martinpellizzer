<p>Tillandsia brevispicula, commonly known as the short-spurred air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically short and wide, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
