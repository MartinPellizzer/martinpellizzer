                    <h1>Tetraena alba var. arabica</h1>
<p>Tetraena alba var. arabica, commonly known as white tetraena, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tetraena alba var. arabica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
