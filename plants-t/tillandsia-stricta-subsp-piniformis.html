<p>Tillandsia stricta subsp.</p>
<p>piniformis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. This epiphytic species thrives in humid environments and does not require soil for growth.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
