                    <h1>Typha angustifolia var. media</h1>
<p>Typha angustifolia var. media, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces abundant brown, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread in aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
