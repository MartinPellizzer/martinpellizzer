<p>Taeniophyllum asperatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
