<p>Tulip of the south, scientifically known as Tulipa gallica var. australis, is a rare and beautiful flower native to southern regions of Europe and western Asia. This variant of the tulip is distinguished by its striking red petals and yellow centers, which create a vivid contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a favorite among gardeners who appreciate its hardy nature. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more common tulip varieties. Its unique appearance and historical significance make it a valuable addition to any botanical collection.</p>
