<p>Tsuga canadensis milfordensis, commonly known as the Milford fir, is a rare subspecies of the balsam fir native to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its conical shape and needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in isolated populations.</p>
