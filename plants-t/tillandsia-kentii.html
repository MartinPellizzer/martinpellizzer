                    <h1>Tillandsia kentii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kentii, commonly known as the Kent's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it capture water and light. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
