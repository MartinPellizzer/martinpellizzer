                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis var. sparsifolia</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis var. sparsifolia, commonly known as the eastern hemlock, is a variant of the hemlock tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more slender than those of the typical eastern hemlock. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its foliage is often sparse and scattered, giving it the varietal name "sparsifolia," which translates to "sparse-leaved.".</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
