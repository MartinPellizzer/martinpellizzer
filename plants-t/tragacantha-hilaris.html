                    <h1>Tragacantha hilaris</h1>
<p>Tragacantha hilaris, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid regions.</p>
