                    <h1>Tragacantha cuscutae</h1>
<p>Tragacantha cuscutae, commonly known as the parasitic tragacanth, is a flowering plant that belongs to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a fibrous, woody stem that often wraps around its host. Its roots secrete chemicals that can inhibit the growth of other plants, giving it a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Tragacantha cuscutae is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
