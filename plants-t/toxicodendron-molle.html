<p>Toxicodendron molle, commonly known as the velvet tamarack, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, clustered leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons.</p>
<p>However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause skin irritation in humans.</p>
