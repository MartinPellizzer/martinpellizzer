<p>Thymus albanus subvar. prokletijensis, commonly known as the ProkletijÃ« thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Albania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and aromatic, small, grey-green leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
