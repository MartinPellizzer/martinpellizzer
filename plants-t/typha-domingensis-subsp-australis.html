<p>Typha domingensis subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Australian cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spikes that produce fluffy seeds, and its broad, sword-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
