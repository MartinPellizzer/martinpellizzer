                    <h1>Trianthema salsoloides var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Trianthema salsoloides var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandmat, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest.</p>
