                    <h1>Turpinia montana var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Turpinia montana var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth turpinia, is a rare shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
