                            <h1>Triticum Leersianum</h1>
<p>Leers' wheat, scientifically known as Triticum leersianum, is a rare and ancient grain species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This wild wheat has remained largely unstudied despite its potential for agricultural and genetic research. Its unique genetic makeup may hold clues to improving modern wheat varieties for drought resistance and yield. Historically, it was used by early farmers before being overshadowed by more productive domesticated strains. Today, renewed interest in heritage crops has brought Leers' wheat back into the spotlight.</p>
