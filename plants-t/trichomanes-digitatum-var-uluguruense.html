                    <h1>Trichomanes digitatum var. uluguruense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes digitatum var. uluguruense, commonly known as the Uluguru fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae, characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically clustered at the base, with a creeping rhizome that helps anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid, shaded forest understories, often on rocky or humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
