                <h1>Tomex myrrha</h1>
<p>Tomex myrrha, commonly known as frankincense, is a resinous substance derived from the sap of the Commiphora tree.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Arabia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark of the tree, allowing the sap to exude and harden into a fragrant gum. It has been used for centuries in religious ceremonies, traditional medicine, and as a perfume.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Tomex myrrha include its aromatic properties and its role in various cultural and historical practices.</p>
