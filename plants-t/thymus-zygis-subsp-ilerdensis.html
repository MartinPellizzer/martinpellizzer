<p>Thymus zygis subsp.</p>
<p>ilerdensis, commonly known as the Iberian thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and aromatic, tiny greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, as well as its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
