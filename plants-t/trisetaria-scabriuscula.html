<p>Trisetaria scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, stream banks, and in wet meadows. Its leaves are usually 10â€“30 cm long and have a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Trisetaria scabriuscula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
