                    <h1>Triticum aethiopicum</h1>
<p>Triticum aethiopicum, commonly known as Ethiopian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are small and have a hard outer coat, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Triticum aethiopicum is considered an important genetic resource for wheat breeding programs due to its potential for improving drought tolerance in cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
