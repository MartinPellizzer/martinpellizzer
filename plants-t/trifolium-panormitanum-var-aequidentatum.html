                    <h1>Trifolium panormitanum var. aequidentatum</h1>
<p>Trifolium panormitanum var. aequidentatum, commonly known as the Panormitanum clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being nearly identical in size and shape, giving it a symmetrical appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
