<p>Tecticornia pergranulata subsp.</p>
<p>pergranulata, commonly known as the rough tecticornia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a rough texture, which aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
