                    <h1>Triticum spelta var. griseoturanorecens</h1>
<p>Triticum spelta var. griseoturanorecens, commonly known as grey-husked spelt, is a lesser-known variant of spelt wheat characterized by its distinctive greyish husk.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of Europe. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are smaller and more compact compared to common wheat, and it is often used in traditional or artisanal baking.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its nutritional profile and is gaining interest in organic and heritage crop cultivation.</p>
