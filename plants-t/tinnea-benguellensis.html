<p>Tinnea benguellensis, commonly known as the Ben Guellens tinnea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple. Tinnea benguellensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>
