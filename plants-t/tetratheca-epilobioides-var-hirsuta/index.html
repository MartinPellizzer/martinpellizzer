                            <h1>Tetratheca Epilobioides Var. Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Hairy tetratheca, scientifically known as Tetratheca epilobioides var. hirsuta, is a unique and attractive shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. This plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it has gained attention among horticulturists and gardeners. However, its habitat is increasingly threatened by urban development and climate change.</p>
