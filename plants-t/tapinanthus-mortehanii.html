                    <h1>Tapinanthus mortehanii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus mortehanii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the roots of larger trees.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils by tapping into the vascular system of its host.</p>
