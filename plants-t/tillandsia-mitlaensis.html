                    <h1>Tillandsia mitlaensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mitlaensis, commonly known as the Mitla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to humid environments and can thrive in shaded, tropical settings.</p>
