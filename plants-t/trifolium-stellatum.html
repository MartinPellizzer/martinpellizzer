<p>Trifolium stellatum, commonly known as star trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Trifolium stellatum is a hardy perennial that is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
