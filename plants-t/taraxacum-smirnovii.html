                    <h1>Taraxacum smirnovii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flowering head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, and is adapted to arid environments with deep root systems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>
