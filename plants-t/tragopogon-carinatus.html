                    <h1>Tragopogon carinatus</h1>
<p>Tragopogon carinatus, commonly known as the crowned wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and distinctive, yellowish-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed heads that resemble miniature wheat ears. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Tragopogon carinatus is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
