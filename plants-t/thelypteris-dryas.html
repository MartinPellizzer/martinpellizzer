<p>Thelypteris dryas, commonly known as the dryas holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris dryas thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
