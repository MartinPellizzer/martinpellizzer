<p>Thelypteris evoluta, commonly known as the spreading shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to elliptic fronds that are often curled when young. The fronds unfurl into a broad, flat shape, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
