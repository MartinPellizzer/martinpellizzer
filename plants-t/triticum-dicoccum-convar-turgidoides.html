                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum convar. turgidoides</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum convar. turgidoides, commonly known as hulless barley, is a wild relative of cultivated barley with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glumes that do not enclose the grain, giving it a hulless appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that bear small, pale grains.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its adaptability and genetic diversity, making it an important resource for breeding programs.</p>
