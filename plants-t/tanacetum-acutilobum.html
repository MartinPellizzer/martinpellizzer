                    <h1>Tanacetum acutilobum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum acutilobum, commonly known as narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds such as thujone, which has historically been used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential toxicity, it is not recommended for use in modern herbal medicine.</p>
