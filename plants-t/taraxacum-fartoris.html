                    <h1>Taraxacum fartoris</h1>
<p>Taraxacum fartoris, commonly known as the humorous dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and alternate in arrangement. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>While not a recognized scientific species, the name "fartoris" is a playful nod to its association with flatulence due to its latex content.</p>
