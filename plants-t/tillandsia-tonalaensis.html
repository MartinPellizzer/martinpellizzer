                    <h1>Tillandsia tonalaensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tonalaensis, commonly known as the Tonala air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
