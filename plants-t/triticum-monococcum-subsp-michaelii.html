<p>Triticum monococcum subsp.</p>
<p>michaelii, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.1 gigabases, making it one of the larger genomes among wheat species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender, branched stems and spikelets that bear small, glabrous lemma and palea. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces achenes that are enclosed in a glumes.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs.</p>
