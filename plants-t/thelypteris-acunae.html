<p>Thelypteris acunae, commonly known as the Acuna holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris acunae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
