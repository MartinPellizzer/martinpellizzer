                    <h1>Tonningia cristata</h1>
<p>Tonningia cristata, commonly known as the cristate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often crinkled thallus, which is typically bright green and covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllids. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>Tonningia cristata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
