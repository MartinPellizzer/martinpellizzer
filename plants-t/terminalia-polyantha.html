                    <h1>Terminalia polyantha</h1>
<p>Terminalia polyantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits.</p>
<p>Terminalia polyantha is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used for furniture and carving, though its conservation status is a growing concern due to overharvesting.</p>
