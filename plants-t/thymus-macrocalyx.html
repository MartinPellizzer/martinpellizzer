                    <h1>Thymus macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Thymus macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in both garden and horticultural settings.</p>
