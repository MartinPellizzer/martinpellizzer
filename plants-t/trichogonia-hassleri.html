<p>Trichogonia hassleri, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Trichogonia hassleri relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
