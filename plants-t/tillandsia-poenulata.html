                    <h1>Tillandsia poenulata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia poenulata, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking silver and green foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
