                    <h1>Triticum caninum var. montanum</h1>
<p>Triticum caninum var. montanum, commonly known as the alpine barley, is a wild wheat species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its resilience and potential for genetic diversity in wheat species.</p>
