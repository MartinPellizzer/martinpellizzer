<p>Tenicroa namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian thornveld grass, is a perennial grass native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous roots that help it survive in arid conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Tenicroa namibensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
