<p>Tillandsia exsudans, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its striking silver-green foliage and occasional flowers make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Tillandsia exsudans requires bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
