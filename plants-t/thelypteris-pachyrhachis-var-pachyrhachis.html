<p>Thelypteris pachyrhachis var. pachyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with broad, parallel veins running the length of the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent presence in the understory of its natural habitat.</p>
