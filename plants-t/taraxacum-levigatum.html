                    <h1>Taraxacum levigatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum levigatum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
