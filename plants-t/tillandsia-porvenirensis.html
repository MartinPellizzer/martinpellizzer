                    <h1>Tillandsia porvenirensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia porvenirensis, commonly known as the Porvenirensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia porvenirensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
