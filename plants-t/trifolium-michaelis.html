                    <h1>Trifolium michaelis</h1>
<p>Trifolium michaelis, commonly known as Michael's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Trifolium michaelis is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
