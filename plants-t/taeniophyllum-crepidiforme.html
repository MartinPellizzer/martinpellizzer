                    <h1>Taeniophyllum crepidiforme</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum crepidiforme, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus, which is covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>This liverwort is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
