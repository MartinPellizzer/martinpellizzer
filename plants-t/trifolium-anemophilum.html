                    <h1>Trifolium anemophilum</h1>
<p>Trifolium anemophilum, commonly known as the wind-pollinated clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, a feature that distinguishes it from other clover species. It thrives in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Trifolium anemophilum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
