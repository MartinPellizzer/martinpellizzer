                    <h1>Tillandsia fasciculata var. densispica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fasciculata var. densispica, commonly known as the dense-spiked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
