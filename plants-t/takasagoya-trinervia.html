                    <h1>Takasagoya trinervia</h1>
<p>Takasagoya trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with three distinct veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually short and upright, with a soft, feathery appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
