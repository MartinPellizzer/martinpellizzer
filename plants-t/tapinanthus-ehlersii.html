                    <h1>Tapinanthus ehlersii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus ehlersii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plant has a slender, vine-like structure with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and minerals, while conducting photosynthesis through its stems.</p>
<p>This unique parasitic relationship makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
