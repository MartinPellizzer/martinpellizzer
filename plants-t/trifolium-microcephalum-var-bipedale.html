                    <h1>Trifolium microcephalum var. bipedale</h1>
<p>Trifolium microcephalum var. bipedale, commonly known as the small-headed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and dense foliage, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
