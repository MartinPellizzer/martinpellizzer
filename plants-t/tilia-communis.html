                    <h1>Tilia communis</h1>
<p>Tilia communis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of its close relative, Tilia cordata. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The wood is light, soft, and easy to work with, making it valuable for carpentry and furniture making.</p>
