                    <h1>Tilia affinis</h1>
<p>Tilia affinis, commonly known as small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common lime (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks or in woodlands.</p>
<p>The wood is soft and lightweight, historically used for furniture and paper production.</p>
