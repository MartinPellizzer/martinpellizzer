                    <h1>Triticum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Triticum pulverulentum, commonly known as the wild wheat or dust wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its role in natural ecosystems. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Triticum pulverulentum is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
