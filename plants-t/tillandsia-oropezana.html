                    <h1>Tillandsia oropezana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia oropezana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
