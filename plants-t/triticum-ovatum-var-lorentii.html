                    <h1>Triticum ovatum var. lorentii</h1>
<p>Triticum ovatum var. lorentii, commonly known as the Lorentii wheatgrass, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the wheatgrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often found in specific alpine or arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically harvested for nutritional or medicinal purposes due to their high nutrient content.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts.</p>
