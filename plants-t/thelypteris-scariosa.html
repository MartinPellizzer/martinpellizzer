<p>Thelypteris scariosa, commonly known as the scarious shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris scariosa prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts.</p>
