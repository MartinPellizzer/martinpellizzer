<p>Telipogon roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon roezlii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
