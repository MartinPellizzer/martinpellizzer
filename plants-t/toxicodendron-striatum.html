                    <h1>Toxicodendron striatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron striatum, commonly known as the striped sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often covered with fine hairs and have a reddish or yellowish stripe along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause skin irritation in humans.</p>
