<p>Thoracosperma hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy roots that help it thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
