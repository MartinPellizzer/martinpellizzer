<p>Thelypteris basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, broadly ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a compact appearance. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, near the margins of the pinnae.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
