                    <h1>Tragacantha siliquosa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha siliquosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Tragacantha siliquosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats.</p>
