<p>Tradescantia difformis, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, three-petaled flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens.</p>
<p>Tradescantia difformis is also valued for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can help suppress weeds.</p>
