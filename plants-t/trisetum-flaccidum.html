<p>Trisetum flaccidum, commonly known as the drooping feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in the summer months.</p>
<p>Trisetum flaccidum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
