                    <h1>Tillandsia × leodiensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × leodiensis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hybrid air plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
