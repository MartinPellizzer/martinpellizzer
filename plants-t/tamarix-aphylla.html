                    <h1>Tamarix aphylla</h1>
<p>Tamarix aphylla, commonly known as the salt cedar or desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences and attract various pollinators. Tamarix aphylla is highly drought-tolerant and can thrive in saline soils, making it adaptable to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
