<p>Tubella tenuis, commonly known as the slender tube worm, is a species of polychaete annelid found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and the presence of a prominent, tube-like structure used for respiration and protection. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is commonly found in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Its morphology and behavior make it an important part of benthic communities.</p>
