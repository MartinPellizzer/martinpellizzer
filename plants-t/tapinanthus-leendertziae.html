                    <h1>Tapinanthus leendertziae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus leendertziae, commonly known as the Leendertz's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant.</p>
