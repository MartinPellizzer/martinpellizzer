<p>Triticum repens var. compactum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
