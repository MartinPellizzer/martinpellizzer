                    <h1>Tapinanthus penteneurus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus penteneurus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that can spread over the host's foliage. It lacks true leaves and relies entirely on its host for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
