                    <h1>Trematolobelia kohalaensis</h1>
<p>Trematolobelia kohalaensis, commonly known as Kohala mountain daisy, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Hawai'i.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the Kohala Mountain region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a significant species for studying adaptive evolution in isolated island ecosystems.</p>
