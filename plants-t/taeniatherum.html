                    <h1>Taeniatherum</h1>
<p>Taeniatherum, commonly known as wild rye, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It includes several species, such as Taeniatherum asperum and Taeniatherum compactum, which are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. These plants typically have tall, slender stalks and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are perennial and have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Taeniatherum species are valued for their ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
