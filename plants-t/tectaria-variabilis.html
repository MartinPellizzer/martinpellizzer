                    <h1>Tectaria variabilis</h1>
<p>Tectaria variabilis, commonly known as the variable tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often serrated or toothed margin. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
