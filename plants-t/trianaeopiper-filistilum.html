<p>Trianaeopiper filistilum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.</p>
