<p>Tillandsia geissei, commonly known as the Geisse's airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia geissei is well adapted to humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
