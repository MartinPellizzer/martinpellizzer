                    <h1>Thelychiton finniganensis</h1>
<p>Thelychiton finniganensis, commonly known as the Finnigan's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Thelychiton finniganensis is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
