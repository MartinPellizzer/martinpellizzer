<p>Thelypteris lanceola, commonly known as the lanceleaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lanceola thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
