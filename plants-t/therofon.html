                    <h1>Therofon</h1>
<p>Therofon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a trait that has fascinated botanists for centuries. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Therofon is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it a subject of ongoing scientific study.</p>
