<p>Thrixspermum raciborskii subsp.</p>
<p>brevipollinium, commonly known as the small-pollen watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems. It belongs to the family Najadaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain minute, buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential to form dense mats, it can impact water quality and aquatic habitats.</p>
