The plant produces small, white, non-showy flowers that are typically found underground or at the base of its foliage. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
