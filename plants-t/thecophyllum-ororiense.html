                    <h1>Thecophyllum ororiense</h1>
<p>Thecophyllum ororiense, commonly known as the mountain mist fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded crevices. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern group.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
