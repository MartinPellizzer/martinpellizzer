The plant exhibits adaptations to cold climates, including a short growing season and frost-resistant physiology. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
