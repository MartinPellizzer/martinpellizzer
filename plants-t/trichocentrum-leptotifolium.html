<p>Trichocentrum leptotifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces pendant, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum leptotifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
