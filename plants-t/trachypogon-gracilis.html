                    <h1>Trachypogon gracilis</h1>
<p>Trachypogon gracilis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in a panicle-like inflorescence. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, characteristic of many grass species.</p>
<p>Trachypogon gracilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
