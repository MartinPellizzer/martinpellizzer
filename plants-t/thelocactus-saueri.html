                    <h1>Thelocactus saueri</h1>
<p>Thelocactus saueri, commonly known as the Sauer's locactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, a feature typical of many desert plants adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Thelocactus saueri is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
