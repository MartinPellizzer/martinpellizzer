<p>Tragacantha paraplesia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small elliptical leaves, and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Tragacantha paraplesia plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
