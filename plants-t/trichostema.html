                    <h1>Trichostema</h1>
<p>Trichostema, commonly known as bluecurls, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers that resemble curls, hence the common name. The leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Trichostema species are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
