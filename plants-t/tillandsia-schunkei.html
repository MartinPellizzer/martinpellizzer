                    <h1>Tillandsia schunkei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Tillandsia schunkei is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
