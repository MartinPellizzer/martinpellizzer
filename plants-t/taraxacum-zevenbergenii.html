                    <h1>Taraxacum zevenbergenii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum zevenbergenii, commonly known as the Zevenbergen dandelion, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a slender, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
