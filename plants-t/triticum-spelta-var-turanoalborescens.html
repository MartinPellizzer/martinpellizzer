                    <h1>Triticum spelta var. turanoalborescens</h1>
<p>Triticum spelta var. turanoalborescens, commonly known as the white wheat, is a lesser-known variant of spelt wheat characterized by its pale, almost white grain.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the Carpathian Basin and is known for its unique genetic makeup and historical significance in traditional agriculture. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with glume-like bracts that enclose the florets. Its grains are smaller and more oval than those of common wheat, contributing to its distinct appearance and culinary uses.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety make it a subject of interest for researchers studying ancient grains and their potential in modern agriculture.</p>
