<p>Triticum trachycaulum, commonly known as the rough wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown glumes.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to arid environments.</p>
