                    <h1>Tillandsia marnieri-lapostollei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia marnieri-lapostollei, commonly known as the Lapostolle air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
