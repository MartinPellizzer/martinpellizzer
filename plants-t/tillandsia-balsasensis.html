                    <h1>Tillandsia balsasensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia balsasensis, commonly known as the Balsas air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for collectors and plant enthusiasts.</p>
