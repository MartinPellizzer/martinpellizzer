<p>Trapa hungarva, commonly known as the Hungarian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into three to five segments, with a thick, waxy coating that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by distinctive spiny, globe-shaped fruits. Its roots are often found in shallow water, anchoring the plant to muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Trapa hungarva plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its dense growth.</p>
