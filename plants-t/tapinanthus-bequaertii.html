                    <h1>Tapinanthus bequaertii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus bequaertii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It lacks true leaves and instead uses its roots to attach to and absorb nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing both the host plants and the surrounding flora.</p>
