                    <h1>Trillium tschonoskii var. atrorubens</h1>
<p>Trillium tschonoskii var. atrorubens, commonly known as the black-red trillium, is a rare and striking member of the Trillium genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red to black petals, which contrast sharply with its deep green, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It produces a single erect stem bearing a single, showy flower with three petals and three sepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
