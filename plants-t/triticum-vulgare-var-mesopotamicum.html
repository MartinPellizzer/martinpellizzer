                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. mesopotamicum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. mesopotamicum, commonly known as Mesopotamic wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains, which are typically harvested for their nutritional value. It is closely related to modern cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in improving wheat resilience to drought and disease.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is also of interest in agricultural research for breeding programs aimed at enhancing crop sustainability.</p>
