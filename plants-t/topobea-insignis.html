                    <h1>Topobea insignis</h1>
<p>Topobea insignis, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and early summer. The plant has a compact, rounded growth form with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are not only visually appealing but also play a role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
