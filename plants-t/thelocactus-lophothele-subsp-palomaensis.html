<p>Thelocactus lophothele subsp.</p>
<p>palomaensis, commonly known as the Palomaensis thlocactus, is a rare cactus species native to a limited region in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which are adaptations to its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding to its ornamental value. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
