                    <h1>Tamarix gallica var. indica</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica var. indica, commonly known as the Indian tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing cones. It is well adapted to arid and saline soils, making it a hardy species that thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
