                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. peterburghum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. peterburghum, commonly known as Canadian amber wheat, is a variety of emmer wheat native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hulled grains, which are retained on the plant until maturity, distinguishing it from modern hulled and hull-less wheat varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender spikes that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable crop for traditional and heritage agricultural practices.</p>
