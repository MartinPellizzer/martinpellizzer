                    <h1>Thyrsanthella</h1>
<p>Thyrsanthella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Thyrsanthella is considered critically endangered.</p>
