                    <h1>Taxus baccata var. nana</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf yew, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a rounded shape, with dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, red-orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in formal landscaping.</p>
