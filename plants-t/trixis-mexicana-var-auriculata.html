                    <h1>Trixis mexicana var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Trixis mexicana var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant.</p>
