                    <h1>Tium miserum</h1>
<p>Tium miserum, commonly known as the sorrowful tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale-blue flowers that bloom only during the short summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which helps reflect the intense sunlight. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Tium miserum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
