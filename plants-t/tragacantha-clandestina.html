                    <h1>Tragacantha clandestina</h1>
<p>Tragacantha clandestina, commonly known as the secret tragacanth, is a rare and elusive plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green flowers and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces a resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Its growth is often concealed beneath dense vegetation, making it difficult to identify without specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Tragacantha clandestina is now considered endangered.</p>
