                    <h1>Trichomanes tunbrigense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes tunbrigense, commonly known as the Scottish maidenhair fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
