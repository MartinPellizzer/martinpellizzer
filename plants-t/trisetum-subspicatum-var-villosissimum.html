<p>Trisetum subspicatum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, hairy structures. The leaves are narrow and typically have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research.</p>
