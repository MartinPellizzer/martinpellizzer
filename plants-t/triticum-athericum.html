<p>Triticum athericum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Triticum athericum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species.</p>
