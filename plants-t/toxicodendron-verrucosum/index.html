                            <h1>Toxicodendron Verrucosum</h1>
<p>Sumac, scientifically known as Toxicodendron verrucosum, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that appear in the fall. Despite its attractive appearance, the plant is highly toxic and can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. The sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that triggers allergic reactions in many people. Due to its harmful properties, it is often avoided or removed from areas where people frequent.</p>
