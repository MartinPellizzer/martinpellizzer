                    <h1>Triticum timonovum</h1>
<p>Triticum timonovum, commonly known as Timonov's wheat, is a rare and little-studied species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous颖花, which contain the characteristic wheat grains. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds potential for agricultural research and breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation is challenging due to its specific ecological requirements and low yield potential.</p>
