                    <h1>Tillandsia toropiensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia toropiensis, commonly known as the Toropiensian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the highlands of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments.</p>
