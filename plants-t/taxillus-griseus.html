                    <h1>Taxillus griseus</h1>
<p>Taxillus griseus, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, shrub-like growth that can cover large sections of the host tree's canopy. Its small, white or pale green berries are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Taxillus griseus plays a significant ecological role in shaping the structure of its host trees and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
