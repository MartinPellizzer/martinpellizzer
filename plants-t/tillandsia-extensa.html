                    <h1>Tillandsia extensa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia extensa, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia extensa produces striking white or purple flower spikes that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
