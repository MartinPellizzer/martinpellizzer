                    <h1>Trichoglottis collenetteae</h1>
<p>Trichoglottis collenetteae, commonly known as the Collenette's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highland regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structure. The plant produces linear, lance-shaped leaves and bears inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that lack a distinct scent. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
