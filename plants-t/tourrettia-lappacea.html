                    <h1>Tourrettia lappacea</h1>
<p>Tourrettia lappacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fruit that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
