                    <h1>Thymus eremita</h1>
<p>Thymus eremita, commonly known as the desert thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves and produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb.</p>
<p>Thymus eremita is also used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
