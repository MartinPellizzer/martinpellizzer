<p>Trapa longicarpa var. mammeata, commonly known as the long-seeded water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, enhancing its spread in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically divided into narrow, ribbon-like segments, which help in buoyancy and photosynthesis.</p>
