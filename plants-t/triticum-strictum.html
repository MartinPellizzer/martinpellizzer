                    <h1>Triticum strictum</h1>
<p>Triticum strictum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny grains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and resistance to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
