                    <h1>Trifolium repens var. biasolettii</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens var. biasolettii, commonly known as the white clover variant, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a white or pale green coloration. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are nutrient-poor, due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in ecological systems.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value.</p>
