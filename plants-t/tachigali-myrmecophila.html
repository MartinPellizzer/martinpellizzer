                    <h1>Tachigali myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Tachigali myrmecophila, commonly known as the antplant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological adaptations that support symbiotic relationships with ants. The plant has specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often dense and leathery, contributing to its resilience in humid, shaded environments.</p>
