                    <h1>Tillandsia aurea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aurea, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a striking golden hue on the leaf tips, which gives it its common name. It produces small, showy inflorescences with pale yellow to orange flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia aurea is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
