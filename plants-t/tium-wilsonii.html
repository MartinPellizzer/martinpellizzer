Native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tium wilsonii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
