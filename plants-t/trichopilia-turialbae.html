                    <h1>Trichopilia turialbae</h1>
<p>Trichopilia turialbae, commonly known as the Turi√°lba's trichopilia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, bloom in shades of white and pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
