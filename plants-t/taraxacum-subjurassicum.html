                    <h1>Taraxacum subjurassicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subjurassicum, commonly known as the Jurassic dandelion, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, much like other dandelions, but it is less common due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its potential links to prehistoric plant evolution.</p>
