<p>Tamarix gallica var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, often branched stems that are typically covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
