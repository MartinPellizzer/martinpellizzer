                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata var. contorta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata var. contorta, commonly known as the curly tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often twisted or curled. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>Its striking silver-green foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
