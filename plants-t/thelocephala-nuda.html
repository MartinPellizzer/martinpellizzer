<p>Thelocephala nuda, commonly known as the naked head lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, pale to dark grey thallus that lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in temperate and boreal forest regions.</p>
<p>Thelocephala nuda is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
