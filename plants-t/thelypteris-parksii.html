                <h1>Thelypteris parksii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris parksii, commonly known as the Park's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, round sori. Thelypteris parksii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the forest understory.</p>
