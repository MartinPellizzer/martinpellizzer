                    <h1>Toxicodendron oligophyllum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron oligophyllum, commonly known as the Chinese lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is known for its ability to exude a sticky, toxic sap that can cause dermatitis in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for its fruit.</p>
