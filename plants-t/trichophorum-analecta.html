<p>Trichophorum analecta, commonly known as the small cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of silky, white or pale pink flowering heads that resemble cotton balls, which appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or peaty soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Trichophorum analecta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
