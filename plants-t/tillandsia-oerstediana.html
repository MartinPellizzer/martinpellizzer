<p>Tillandsia oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a small water-holding cup at the center. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain moisture.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
