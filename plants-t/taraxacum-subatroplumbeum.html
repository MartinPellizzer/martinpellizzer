<p>Taraxacum subatroplumbeum, commonly known as the pale-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower that develops into a white, feathery pappus, aiding in wind pollination. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, often in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This species is relatively rare and has specific ecological requirements, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
