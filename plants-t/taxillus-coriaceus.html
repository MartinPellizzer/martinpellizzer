                    <h1>Taxillus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Taxillus coriaceus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as the neem and tamarind.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous white or pink flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Taxillus coriaceus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
