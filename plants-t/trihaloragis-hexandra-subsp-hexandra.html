<p>Trihaloragis hexandra subsp.</p>
<p>hexandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its aquatic habitat and ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
