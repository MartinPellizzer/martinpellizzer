<p>Tillandsia barbeyana, commonly known as the Barbet's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
