                    <h1>Tortula chisosa</h1>
<p>Tortula chisosa, commonly known as the Chisos mountain moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often seen in desert regions of the southwestern United States. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its leaves are closely arranged and covered in a thick layer of papillae, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Tortula chisosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
