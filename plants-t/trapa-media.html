<p>Trapa media, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The seeds of Trapa media are often dispersed by water currents and can remain viable for several years.</p>
