                    <h1>Tanacetum heimerlii</h1>
<p>Tanacetum heimerlii, commonly known as the Alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Tanacetum heimerlii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>
