                    <h1>Tristerix grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Tristerix grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorus mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and attaches itself to the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tristerix grandiflorus plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and birds, though it can also cause stress to its host trees.</p>
