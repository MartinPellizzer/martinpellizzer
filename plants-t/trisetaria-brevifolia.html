                    <h1>Trisetaria brevifolia</h1>
<p>Trisetaria brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Trisetaria brevifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
