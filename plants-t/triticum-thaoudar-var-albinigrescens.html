                    <h1>Triticum thaoudar var. albinigrescens</h1>
<p>Triticum thaoudar var. albinigrescens, commonly known as the white-black wheat, is a rare variant of the wild wheat species native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique grain coloration, which transitions from white to dark brown as it matures. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient crop domestication and biodiversity.</p>
