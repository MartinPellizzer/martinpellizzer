                    <h1>Thamnosma texana f. purpurea</h1>
<p>Thamnosma texana f. purpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf thamnosma, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that often display a striking purplish hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its foliage is highly fragrant, and the leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
