                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × adornatus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × adornatus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a fascinating hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus calycinus and Turbinicarpus lehmannianus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a colorful, flattened top (the "cactus" part) and a swollen, bulbous base (the "rootstock"). The plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-draining soils and full sun. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a horticultural hybrid, often cultivated for its striking visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds.</p>
