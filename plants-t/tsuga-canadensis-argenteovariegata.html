                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis argenteovariegata</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis argenteovariegata, commonly known as the silver-variegated hemlock, is a cultivar of the eastern hemlock tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white and silver markings on its needle-like leaves. The plant is native to North America and thrives in cool, moist climates with partial to full shade. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small landscapes or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production in the leaves.</p>
