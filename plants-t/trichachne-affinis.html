                    <h1>Trichachne affinis</h1>
<p>Trichachne affinis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its environment.</p>
<p>Trichachne affinis is valued in some regions for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil.</p>
