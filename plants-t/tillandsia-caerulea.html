<p>Tillandsia caerulea, commonly known as the blue tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its most striking feature is its vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Tillandsia caerulea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
