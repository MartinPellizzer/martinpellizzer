                    <h1>Taraxacum molybdinum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum molybdinum, commonly known as the leadplant or lead weed, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow composite flowers. The plant is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, particularly lead, in its tissues, making it a potential indicator species for soil contamination. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in phytoremediation studies.</p>
