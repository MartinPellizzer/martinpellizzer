<p>Taraxacum abax, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments.
