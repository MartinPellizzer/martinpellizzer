                    <h1>Tapinanthus usambarensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambarensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread along its host. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
