                    <h1>Trigonella geminiflora var. curvata</h1>
<p>Trigonella geminiflora var. curvata, commonly known as the curly-flowered fenugreek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are arranged in a unique spiral pattern, giving it its common name. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to regular fenugreek.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variety make it distinct from other Trigonella species, particularly in its floral structure and growth habit.</p>
