                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × aemulus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × aemulus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a fascinating succulent that results from the cross between Turbinicarpus calycinus and Turbinicarpus lehmannii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often vividly patterned tubercles that form a rounded, globular shape. The plant's fleshy, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the growing season, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds.</p>
