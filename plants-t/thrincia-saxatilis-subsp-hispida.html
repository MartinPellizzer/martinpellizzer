<p>Thrincia saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>hispida, commonly known as the rough thrincia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies hispida is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which helps protect it from desiccation in harsh conditions. It typically grows in well-drained soils on slopes and cliffs, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations and ornamental value.</p>
