                    <h1>Tillandsia lucida</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lucida, commonly known as the bright tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia lucida is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
