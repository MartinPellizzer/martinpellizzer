<p>Tamonea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tamonea species produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
