<p>Tillandsia apicroides, commonly known as the purple rosette air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
