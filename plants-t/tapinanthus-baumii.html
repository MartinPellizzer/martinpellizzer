                    <h1>Tapinanthus baumii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus baumii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers that can resemble those of its host species. Its root system forms symbiotic connections with the roots of its host, allowing it to draw sustenance.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
