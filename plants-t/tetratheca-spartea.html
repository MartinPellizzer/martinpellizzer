<p>Tetratheca spartea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tetratheca, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tetratheca spartea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
