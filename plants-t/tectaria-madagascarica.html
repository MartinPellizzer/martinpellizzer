                    <h1>Tectaria madagascarica</h1>
<p>Tectaria madagascarica, commonly known as the Madagascar shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick, protective layer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
