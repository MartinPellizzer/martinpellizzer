<p>Thelypteris navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris navarrensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various small organisms.</p>
