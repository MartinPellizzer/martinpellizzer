                    <h1>Trochocarpa verticillata</h1>
<p>Trochocarpa verticillata, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of fleshy, spiny stems that spiral upward, forming a distinctive, compact structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and aiding in protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Trochocarpa verticillata is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
