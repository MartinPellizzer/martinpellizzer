                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. spelta</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain that belongs to the wheat family (Poaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hulled grains, which remain attached to the chaff until threshing. Spelt plants typically grow to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The seeds are small and oval, with a hard outer husk that protects the endosperm.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its higher protein content and distinct nutty flavor compared to modern wheat varieties.</p>
