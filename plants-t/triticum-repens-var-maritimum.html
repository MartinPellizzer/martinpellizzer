                    <h1>Triticum repens var. maritimum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. maritimum, commonly known as sea grass or beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often used in coastal stabilization efforts.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity in maritime environments.</p>
