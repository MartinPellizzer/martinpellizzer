                    <h1>Tillandsia cordobensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
