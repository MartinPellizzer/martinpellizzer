                    <h1>Tapiphyllum psammophilum</h1>
<p>Tapiphyllum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-loving spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its water-storing tissues. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic environments.</p>
