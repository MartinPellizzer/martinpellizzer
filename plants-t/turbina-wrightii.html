<p>Turbina wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's turban snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Streptaxidae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that is typically brown or reddish in color. The shell is smooth and has a distinct, conical shape, which helps protect the snail from predators and environmental stressors. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky areas or under debris where moisture is retained.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Turbina wrightii is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
