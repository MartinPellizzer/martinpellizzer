                    <h1>Taraxacum adpressum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum adpressum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar seed-bearing "puffball" after pollination. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to many other regions, often becoming a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
