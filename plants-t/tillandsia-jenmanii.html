<p>Tillandsia jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.

It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
