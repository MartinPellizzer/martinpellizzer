<p>Trichosanthes dioica, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or horned melon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous vine that produces large, orange-red, inflated fruits with a spiky exterior. The plant has separate male and female flowers, typical of its dioecious nature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, while the stems are hairy and trailing.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when mature, though its thick rind and bitter taste require careful preparation.</p>
