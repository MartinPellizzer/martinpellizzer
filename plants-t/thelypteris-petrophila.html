<p>Thelypteris petrophila, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
