                    <h1>Tridactyle exellii</h1>
<p>Tridactyle exellii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that blooms in late summer. Its unique morphology includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often displaying vibrant purple or pink hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tridactyle exellii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
