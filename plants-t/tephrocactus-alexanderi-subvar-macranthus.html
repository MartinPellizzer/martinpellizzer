                    <h1>Tephrocactus alexanderi subvar. macranthus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus alexanderi subvar. macranthus, commonly known as the Alexander's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
