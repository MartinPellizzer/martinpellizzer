                    <h1>Triticum durum f. square-head</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. square-head, commonly known as durum wheat with square-head, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinct, square-shaped glumes.</p>
<p>This feature is a morphological trait that distinguishes it from other wheat varieties and is often associated with specific environmental adaptations. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family and is cultivated primarily for its high gluten content, which is essential for making durum semolina. Its unique head structure may influence its agronomic performance and susceptibility to certain pests or diseases.</p>
<p>The square-head form is of interest in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat yield and resilience.</p>
