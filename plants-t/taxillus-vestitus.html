                    <h1>Taxillus vestitus</h1>
<p>Taxillus vestitus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Taxillus, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green leaves and white or yellowish flowers, followed by berries that are often eaten by birds. It is found in various regions of Asia and is part of the Santalaceae family.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal by birds, which consume the berries and deposit the seeds on new host trees.</p>
