                    <h1>Taeniophyllum northlandicum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum northlandicum, commonly known as the Northland duckweed, is a small aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in nutrient-rich ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
