                    <h1>Tillandsia tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
