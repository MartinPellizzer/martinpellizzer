                    <h1>Taxodium distichum var. patens</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum var. patens, commonly known as the broad-leaf bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that turn a striking reddish-brown in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release winged seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetland habitats, where its roots can tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
