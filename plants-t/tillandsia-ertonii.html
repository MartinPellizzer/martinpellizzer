                    <h1>Tillandsia ertonii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ertonii, commonly known as the Silver Volute, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to grow on trees without soil. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
