<p>Trichonema columnae var. gallaecium, commonly known as the Galician feather moss, is a rare and specialized moss species native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance, with densely packed, slender shoots that form a dense carpet. Its small, elongated leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unique aesthetic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
