                    <h1>Tillandsia pulchella f. surinamensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pulchella f. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
