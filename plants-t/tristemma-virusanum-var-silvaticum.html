                    <h1>Tristemma virusanum var. silvaticum</h1>
<p>Tristemma virusanum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the wild tristemma, is a variant of the tristemma plant characterized by its adaptation to forested environments.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits smaller, more elongated leaves compared to its cultivated relatives, which is an evolutionary response to low-light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its natural habitat, it is less commonly cultivated than other tristemma varieties but is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
