<p>Tillandsia reversa, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup. The leaves are typically silver-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
