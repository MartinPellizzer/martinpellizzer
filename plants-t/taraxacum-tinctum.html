                    <h1>Taraxacum tinctum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum tinctum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>Taraxacum tinctum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
