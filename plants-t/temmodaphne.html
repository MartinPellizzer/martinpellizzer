                    <h1>Temmodaphne</h1>
<p>Temmodaphne, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, Temmodaphne can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
