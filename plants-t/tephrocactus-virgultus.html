                    <h1>Tephrocactus virgultus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus virgultus, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive long periods of drought.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's rugged appearance.</p>
