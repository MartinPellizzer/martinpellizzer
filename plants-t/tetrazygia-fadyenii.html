<p>Tetrazygia fadyenii, commonly known as the Fadyenii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is adapted to humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
