                    <h1>Thuarea sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Thuarea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping thuaria, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Thuarea sarmentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and dry environments.</p>
