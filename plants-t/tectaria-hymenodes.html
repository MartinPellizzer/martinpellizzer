                    <h1>Tectaria hymenodes</h1>
<p>Tectaria hymenodes, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, moss-like scales. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and branched, supporting the growth of its delicate, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
