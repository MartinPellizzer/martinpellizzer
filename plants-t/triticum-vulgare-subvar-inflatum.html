                    <h1>Triticum vulgare subvar. inflatum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare subvar. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique seed head structure.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its distinctive, swollen spikelets that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to standard wheat varieties. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other cereal grains. The inflated spikelets are a result of genetic variation, which may influence its growth patterns and seed dispersal mechanisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological traits and potential agricultural applications.</p>
