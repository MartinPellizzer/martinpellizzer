                    <h1>Tamarix karakalensis var. scoparia</h1>
<p>Tamarix karakalensis var. scoparia, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is highly drought-tolerant and can thrive in saline soils, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
