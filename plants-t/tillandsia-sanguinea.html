<p>Tillandsia sanguinea, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking red or orange flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sanguinea is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
