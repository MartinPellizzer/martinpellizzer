<p>Tectaria prolifera, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria prolifera is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent and resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
