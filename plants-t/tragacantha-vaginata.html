                    <h1>Tragacantha vaginata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha vaginata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its latex sap is highly viscous and has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>Tragacantha vaginata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
