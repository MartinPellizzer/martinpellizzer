                    <h1>Tenageia vaillantii</h1>
<p>Tenageia vaillantii, commonly known as the Vaillant's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. It produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Tenageia vaillantii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
