                    <h1>Trillium ozarkanum</h1>
<p>Trillium ozarkanum, commonly known as the Ozark trillium, is a rare and endangered perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three large, waxy, white petals and three leaf-like bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. It blooms in early spring, producing a single, showy flower that attracts pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
