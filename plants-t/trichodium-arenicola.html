                    <h1>Trichodium arenicola</h1>
<p>Trichodium arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on bare rock surfaces, sandy soils, and in other harsh, nutrient-poor habitats. Its structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Trichodium arenicola plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing microhabitats for other organisms in extreme environments.</p>
