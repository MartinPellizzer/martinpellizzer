<p>Telipodus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Telipodus species are herbaceous perennials that often grow in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to humans and animals.</p>
