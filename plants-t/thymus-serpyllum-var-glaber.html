                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum var. glaber</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum var. glaber, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, though the 'glaber' variety is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces pink or white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
