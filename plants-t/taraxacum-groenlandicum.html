                    <h1>Taraxacum groenlandicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum groenlandicum, commonly known as the Greenland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in harsh, high-latitude environments.</p>
