<p>Water chestnut, scientifically known as Trapa pseudincisa var. potaninii, is a aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It thrives in shallow waters and is characterized by its distinctive spiny fruits. The plant is often mistaken for its more common relative, the water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa), due to similar appearances. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic species. Despite its ecological benefits, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
