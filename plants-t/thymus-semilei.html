                    <h1>Thymus semilei</h1>
<p>Thymus semilei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pink or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for both its fragrance and visual appeal.</p>
