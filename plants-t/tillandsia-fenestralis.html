The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia fenestralis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
