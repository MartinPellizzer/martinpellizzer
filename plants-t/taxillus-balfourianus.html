                    <h1>Taxillus balfourianus</h1>
<p>Taxillus balfourianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees such as mango and neem.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, leafy mass that can significantly affect the growth and health of its host. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus balfourianus is found throughout South and Southeast Asia, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
