<p>Trichodia, commonly known as the "trichodia" or "trichodia plant," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems, which are adaptations to its native arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Trichodia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
