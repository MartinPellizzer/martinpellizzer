<p>Themistoclesia horquetensis, commonly known as the Horquetense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and maples. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
