                    <h1>Tephroseris subfloccosa</h1>
<p>Tephroseris subfloccosa, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white thallus, which is loosely branched and covered with a fine, powdery layer. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is often found on rocks and soil surfaces in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is an indicator species for certain types of desert ecosystems.</p>
