                    <h1>Tapinanthus cinereus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus cinereus, commonly known as the ash-colored dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
