                    <h1>Trisetaria pumila</h1>
<p>Trisetaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. The plant has slender, wiry stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance.</p>
<p>Trisetaria pumila is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
