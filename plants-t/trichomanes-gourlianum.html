                    <h1>Trichomanes gourlianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes gourlianum, commonly known as the Gourlian maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the more widely known maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes gourlianum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
