                    <h1>Taxillus paucifolius</h1>
<p>Taxillus paucifolius, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its roots, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is found primarily in South America.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
