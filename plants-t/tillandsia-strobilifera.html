                    <h1>Tillandsia strobilifera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia strobilifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spike, and it produces air-borne seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Tillandsia strobilifera is appreciated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
