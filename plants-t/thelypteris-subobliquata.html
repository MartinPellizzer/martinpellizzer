<p>Thelypteris subobliquata, commonly known as the oblique fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or rusty-colored hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a distinct midrib.</p>
