                    <h1>Tilia nigra</h1>
<p>Tilia nigra, commonly known as black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. Its roots can produce a toxic compound called juglone, which inhibits the growth of other plants nearby.</p>
<p>Black walnut is valued for its timber, ornamental use, and historical significance in indigenous cultures.</p>
