<p>Trichomanes draytonianum, commonly known as the Drayton's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>

Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes draytonianum is notable for its historical significance in botanical studies and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns.</p>
