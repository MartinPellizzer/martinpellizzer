                    <h1>Tapinanthus luteovittatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus luteovittatus, commonly known as the yellow-striped dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals and is often found growing on various species of legumes. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to its host through specialized haustoria. It is native to parts of Africa and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
