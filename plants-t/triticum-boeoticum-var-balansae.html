                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. balansae</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. balansae, commonly known as the wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 14.5 Gb, making it one of the smallest genomes among wheat relatives. The plant typically grows to a height of 50â€“100 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed glumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat.</p>
