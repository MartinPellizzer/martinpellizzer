                    <h1>Thymus zetlandicus</h1>
<p>Thymus zetlandicus, commonly known as Zetland thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of aromatic, tiny, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
