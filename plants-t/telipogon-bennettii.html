<p>Telipogon bennettii, commonly known as Bennett's grass, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to understanding the adaptation strategies of plants in extreme environments.</p>
