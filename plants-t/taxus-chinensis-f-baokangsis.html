<p>Taxus chinensis f. baokangsis, commonly known as the Baokang yew, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Chinese yew.</p>

It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
