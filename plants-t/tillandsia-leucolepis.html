                    <h1>Tillandsia leucolepis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia leucolepis, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
