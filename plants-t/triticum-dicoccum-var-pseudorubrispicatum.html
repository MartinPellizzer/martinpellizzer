                    <h1>Triticum dicoccum var. pseudorubrispicatum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum var. pseudorubrispicatum, commonly known as black spelt, is a variety of spelt wheat characterized by its dark, almost black husks and compact spikelets.</p>
<p>It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with alternate, narrow leaves that are hairy along the veins. Its flowers are arranged in spikes, and the grains are enclosed in tough, inedible glumes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in artisanal baking due to its distinct flavor and texture.</p>
