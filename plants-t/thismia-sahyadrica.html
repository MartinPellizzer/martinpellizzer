                    <h1>Thismia sahyadrica</h1>
<p>Thismia sahyadrica, commonly known as the Sahyadri Thismia, is an unusual plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are not true flowers but serve as attractive structures for pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats.</p>
