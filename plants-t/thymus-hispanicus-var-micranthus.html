                    <h1>Thymus hispanicus var. micranthus</h1>
<p>Thymus hispanicus var. micranthus, commonly known as Spanish thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves with a strong thyme scent, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use, though its fragrance is more intense than that of common thyme.</p>
<p>This variety is also noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
