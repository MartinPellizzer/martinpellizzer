<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common to most fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris alticola is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
