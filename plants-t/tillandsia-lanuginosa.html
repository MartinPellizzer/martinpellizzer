The plant is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that resembles wool, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Tillandsia lanuginosa is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its unique appearance and ability to absorb moisture through its leaves.</p>
