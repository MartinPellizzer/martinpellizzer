<p>Tragacantha meana, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that contain its valuable resin, known as tragacanth. This resin has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries.</p>
<p>Tragacantha meana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
