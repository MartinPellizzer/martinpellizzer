                    <h1>Trillium grandiflorum f. viride</h1>
<p>Trillium grandiflorum f. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered white trillium, is a unique variant of the white trillium native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its striking greenish-white petals, which set it apart from the typical white petals of the species. The plant features three broad, waxy leaves and a single, three-lobed flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of forest ecosystems.</p>
