<p>Tillandsia durangensis, commonly known as the Durango air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
