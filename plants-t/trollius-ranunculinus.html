                    <h1>Trollius ranunculinus</h1>
<p>Trollius ranunculinus, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its wet environment. Its stems are usually erect and can reach heights of up to 60 cm, supporting the clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Trollius ranunculinus is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating skin conditions and as a diuretic.</p>
