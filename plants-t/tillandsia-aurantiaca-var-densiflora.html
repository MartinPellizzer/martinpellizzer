                    <h1>Tillandsia aurantiaca var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aurantiaca var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
