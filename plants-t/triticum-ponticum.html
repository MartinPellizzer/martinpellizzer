                    <h1>Triticum ponticum</h1>
<p>Triticum ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant with a tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, glabrous grains that are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Triticum ponticum is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic diversity and historical significance in wheat evolution.</p>
