                    <h1>Tillandsia retrorsa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia retrorsa, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
