                    <h1>Triodia aristiglumis</h1>
<p>Triodia aristiglumis, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tussock-forming habit and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains.</p>
