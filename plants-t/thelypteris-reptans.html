<p>Thelypteris reptans, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape, and they are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Thelypteris reptans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
