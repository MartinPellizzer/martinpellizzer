<p>Tithymalus megalatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic tithymalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. It is typically found in rocky outcrops and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments.</p>
