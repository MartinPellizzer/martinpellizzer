<p>Taeniophyllum exotrachys, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves that are usually opposite or whorled in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to derive some of its nutrients from the host plant while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
