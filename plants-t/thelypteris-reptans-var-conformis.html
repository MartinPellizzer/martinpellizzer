<p>Thelypteris reptans var. conformis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and size. The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings.</p>
