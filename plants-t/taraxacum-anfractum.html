<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access moisture in dry soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Taraxacum anfractum is often found in limestone or sandy soils and is considered a rare or endangered species in many areas.</p>
