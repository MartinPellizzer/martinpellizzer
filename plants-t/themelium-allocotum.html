                    <h1>Themelium allocotum</h1>
<p>Themelium allocotum, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Themelium allocotum is considered an important species for ecological studies in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
