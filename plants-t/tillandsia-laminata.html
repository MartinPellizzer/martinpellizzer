<p>Tillandsia laminata, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are showy, often appearing in clusters of pink, red, or orange, and can last for several weeks.</p>
<p>Tillandsia laminata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
