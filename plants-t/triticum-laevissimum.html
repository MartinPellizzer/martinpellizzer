<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. This plant is closely related to modern wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated wheat varieties. Triticum laevissimum typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
