<p>Torresia nashii, commonly known as the Nash's torresia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is a small, slow-growing palm characterized by its slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Torresia nashii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
