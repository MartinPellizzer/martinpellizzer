<p>Troximon gracilens, commonly known as the slender-tailed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Troximon gracilens is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
