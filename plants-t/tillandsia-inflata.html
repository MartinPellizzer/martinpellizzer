                    <h1>Tillandsia inflata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia inflata, commonly known as the inflated air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflated, balloon-like leaves that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia inflata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
