<p>Thymus richardii, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb.</p>
<p>Thymus richardii is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
