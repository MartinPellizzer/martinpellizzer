<p>Tillandsia bangii, commonly known as the silver vase, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking silver-blue foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bangii requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive.</p>
