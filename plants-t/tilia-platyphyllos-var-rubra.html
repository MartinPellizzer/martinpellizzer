<p>Tilia platyphyllos var. rubra, commonly known as the red-leaf linden, is a variant of the common linden tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive reddish foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of other linden species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas. It produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and often turn a vibrant red in the fall, making it a visually striking ornamental plant.</p>
