                    <h1>Tuberostylis</h1>
<p>Tuberostylis, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, often hairy foliage and their distinctive inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. Tuberostylis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, many of which have tuberous roots that store nutrients, aiding in their survival in variable conditions.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
