                    <h1>Tillaea aquatica var. drummondii</h1>
<p>Tillaea aquatica var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
