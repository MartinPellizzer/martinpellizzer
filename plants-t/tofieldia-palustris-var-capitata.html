                    <h1>Tofieldia palustris var. capitata</h1>
<p>Tofieldia palustris var. capitata, commonly known as swamp beakrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, tolerating saturated soils and fluctuating water levels. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>The varietal form, capitata, is distinguished by its compact, head-like flowering arrangement.</p>
