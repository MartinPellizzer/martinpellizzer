                    <h1>Triticum sphaerococcum var. malkoffii</h1>
<p>Triticum sphaerococcum var. malkoffii, commonly known as the Malkoff wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive spherical grain structure.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. Its grains are small and round, forming dense clusters that resemble miniature spheres, which is a key botanical feature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying wheat evolution and genetic diversity.</p>
