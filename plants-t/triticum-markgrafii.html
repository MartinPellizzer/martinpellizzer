                    <h1>Triticum markgrafii</h1>
<p>Triticum markgrafii, commonly known as Markgraf's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and florets that are often pale green to brown in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, Triticum markgrafii is of interest to researchers studying wild relatives of cultivated wheat.</p>
