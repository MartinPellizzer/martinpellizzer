                    <h1>Trixis divaricata var. cladoptera</h1>
<p>Trixis divaricata var. cladoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trixis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
