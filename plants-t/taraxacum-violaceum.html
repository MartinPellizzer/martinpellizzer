                    <h1>Taraxacum violaceum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum violaceum, commonly known as violet leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of violet-hued, heart-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators.</p>
