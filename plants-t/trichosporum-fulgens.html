<p>Trichosporum fulgens, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common ornamental and erosion control plant.</p>
<p>Trichosporum fulgens is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
