                    <h1>Tillandsia barfussii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia barfussii, commonly known as the Barfuss air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
