<p>Tristerix peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are often consumed by birds, play a role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Tristerix peruvianus is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, and its parasitic nature allows it to obtain nutrients from its host.</p>
