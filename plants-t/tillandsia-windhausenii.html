                    <h1>Tillandsia windhausenii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia windhausenii, commonly known as the Windhausen's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
