                    <h1>Triticum cereale var. montaniforme</h1>
<p>Triticum cereale var. montaniforme, commonly known as mountain wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat that exhibits distinct morphological traits adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in cooler, mountainous regions and possesses a shorter stature compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant features robust roots and a dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its grains are generally smaller and have a higher protein content, making it valuable for specific agricultural and nutritional applications.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in plant breeding programs aimed at developing wheat strains suited for alpine and marginal soils.</p>
