<p>Trigonochilum gramazuense, commonly known as the Gramazu's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three sepals and three petals that form a distinctive trigonal shape. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of stamens and a specialized labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum gramazuense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
