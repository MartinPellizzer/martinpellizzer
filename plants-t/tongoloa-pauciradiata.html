                    <h1>Tongoloa pauciradiata</h1>
<p>Tongoloa pauciradiata, commonly known as the Hawaiian redwood, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a rounded canopy. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Tongoloa pauciradiata is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
