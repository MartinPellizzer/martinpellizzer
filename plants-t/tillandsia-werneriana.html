                    <h1>Tillandsia werneriana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia werneriana, commonly known as the Werneri air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette shape, with leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia werneriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
