                    <h1>Tillandsia lateritia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lateritia, commonly known as the rock air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the dry regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in well-drained, rocky substrates and requires bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
