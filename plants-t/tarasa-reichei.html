                    <h1>Tarasa reichei</h1>
<p>Tarasa reichei, commonly known as the Reiche's tarasa, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tarasa reichei is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
