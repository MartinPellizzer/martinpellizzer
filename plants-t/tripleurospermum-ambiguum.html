                    <h1>Tripleurospermum ambiguum</h1>
<p>Tripleurospermum ambiguum, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and grasslands. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but lacks the characteristic milky sap found in those species.</p>
