                    <h1>Triptilion laxum</h1>
<p>Triptilion laxum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for spore production. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insight into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
