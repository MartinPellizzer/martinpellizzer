                    <h1>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. surinamensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam slender air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
