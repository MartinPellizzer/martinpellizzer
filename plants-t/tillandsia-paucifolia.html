                    <h1>Tillandsia paucifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Tillandsia paucifolia is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
