                    <h1>Telanthera maritima var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Telanthera maritima var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bluemink, is a coastal plant native to sandy shores and dunes.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in maritime regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
