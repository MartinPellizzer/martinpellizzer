                    <h1>Tillandsia coarctata var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia coarctata var. pedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
