<p>Tillandsia longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a dense covering of fine trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
