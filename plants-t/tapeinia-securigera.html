                    <h1>Tapeinia securigera</h1>
<p>Tapeinia securigera, commonly known as the corn smut fungus, is a parasitic ascomycete that infects maize and other grasses.</p>
<p>It produces gelatinous, black, spore-filled structures called "sori" on the infected plant tissue. The fungus overwinters as teliospores, which germinate to produce basidiospores that spread via wind. It causes significant economic losses in agriculture by reducing crop yield and quality.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical response includes the formation of galls, which are abnormal growths resulting from the fungal infection.</p>
