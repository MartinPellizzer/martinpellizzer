                    <h1>Tillandsia domingensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Native to the Caribbean, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
