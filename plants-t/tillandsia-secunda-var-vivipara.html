                    <h1>Tillandsia secunda var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Tillandsia secunda var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water and nutrients from the environment. This variety is notable for its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where pups are born fully developed and can be detached and grown independently. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique reproductive method and air-purifying properties make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
