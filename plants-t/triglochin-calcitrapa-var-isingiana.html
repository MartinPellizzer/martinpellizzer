                    <h1>Triglochin calcitrapa var. isingiana</h1>
<p>Triglochin calcitrapa var. isingiana, commonly known as the Isingian glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and salt. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, marshes, and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salinity conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora.</p>
