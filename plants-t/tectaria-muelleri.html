<p>Tectaria muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests and humid woodlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of rhizome scales.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
