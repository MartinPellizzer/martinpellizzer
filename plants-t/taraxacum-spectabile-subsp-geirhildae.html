<p>Taraxacum spectabile subsp.</p>
<p>geirhildae, commonly known as the Geirhild's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads that bloom in early summer, followed by the characteristic puffball seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing the typical composite flower structure with other dandelions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
