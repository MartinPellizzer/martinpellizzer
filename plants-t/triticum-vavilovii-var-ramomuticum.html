<p>Triticum vavilovii var. ramomuticum, commonly known as the wild wheat or Russian wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. This plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a wild relative of cultivated wheat.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
