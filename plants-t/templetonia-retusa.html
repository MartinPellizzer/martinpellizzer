<p>Templetonia retusa, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, relying on them for water and nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Templetonia retusa plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
