                    <h1>Tillandsia bulbosa f. alba</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bulbosa f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a unique epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features dense, fibrous leaf rosettes that can trap water and provide a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale in color, are often hidden within the foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
