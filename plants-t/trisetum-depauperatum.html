                    <h1>Trisetum depauperatum</h1>
<p>Trisetum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Trisetum depauperatum is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
