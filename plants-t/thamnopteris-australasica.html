<p>Thamnopteris australasica, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thamnopteris australasica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>
