                    <h1>Trixis calcicola</h1>
<p>Trixis calcicola, commonly known as the coastal trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and greyish-blue foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
