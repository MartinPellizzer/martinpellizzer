                    <h1>Tillandsia regnellii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia regnellii, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fibrous covering that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its rosette-shaped structure helps collect and retain water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
