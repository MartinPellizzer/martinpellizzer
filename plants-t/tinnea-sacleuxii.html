                    <h1>Tinnea sacleuxii</h1>
<p>Tinnea sacleuxii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sap is milky and toxic, which serves as a natural defense against herbivores.</p>
<p>Tinnea sacleuxii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
