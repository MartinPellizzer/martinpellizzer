                    <h1>Trifolium recurvum</h1>
<p>Trifolium recurvum, commonly known as the curlleaf clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Trifolium recurvum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
