<p>Triticum monococcum subsp.</p>
<p>sinskajae, commonly known as the Siberian emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glume-like bracts that enclose its florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces spikelets with two to three florets, which are often sterile or underdeveloped. Its botanical features include awned lemma and palea, with the lemma usually shorter than the palea.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
