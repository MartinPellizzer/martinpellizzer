                    <h1>Triticum maritimum</h1>
<p>Triticum maritimum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to saline and windy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which contain the seeds. Triticum maritimum is often found growing on dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh maritime conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
