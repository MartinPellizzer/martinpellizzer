<p>Tragacantha effusa, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus effusus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a viscous resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha effusa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open woodlands.</p>
