<p>Tragopogon pratensis var. tortilis, commonly known as the curlyhead thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curly, bristly leaves and a tall, spindly stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
