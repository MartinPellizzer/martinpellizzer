                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × bicolor</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × bicolor, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a fascinating succulent that results from the cross between Turbinicarpus subulatus and Turbinicarpus leucopictus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful crown, which can range from red to yellow, often contrasting with its green, segmented stem. The plant is native to the arid regions of Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and striking appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful attention to prevent overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</p>
