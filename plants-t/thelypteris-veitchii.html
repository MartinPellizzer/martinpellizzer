<p>Thelypteris veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
