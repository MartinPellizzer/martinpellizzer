                            <h1>Tanacetum Coccineum Subsp. Carneum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum coccineum subsp. carneum is a striking member of the Asteraceae family known for its vivid red flowers and compact growth habit. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance that adds to its ornamental appeal. The plant's unique coloration makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively rare in cultivation, making it a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts.</p>
