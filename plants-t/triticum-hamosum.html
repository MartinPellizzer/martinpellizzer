                    <h1>Triticum hamosum</h1>
<p>Triticum hamosum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, brown grains that are not typically cultivated for food.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of agricultural use, it plays a role in ecological systems and has been studied for its genetic potential in breeding programs.</p>
