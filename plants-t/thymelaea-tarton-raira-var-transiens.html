The plant exhibits a unique flowering pattern, with blooms appearing in response to seasonal changes rather than a fixed annual cycle. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
