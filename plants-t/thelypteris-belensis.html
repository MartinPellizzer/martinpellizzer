                    <h1>Thelypteris belensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris belensis, commonly known as the Bornean holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Thelypteris belensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
