                    <h1>Taeniophyllum terrestre</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum terrestre, commonly known as the ground mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the roots of other plants, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Taeniophyllum terrestre plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing host plant growth and providing habitat for certain microorganisms.</p>
