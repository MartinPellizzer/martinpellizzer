                    <h1>Tephras</h1>
<p>Tephras, commonly known as volcanic ash, is a type of pyroclastic material formed from fragmented volcanic rock and glass.</p>
<p>It is composed of fine particles of ash and pumice, often produced during explosive volcanic eruptions. Tephras can vary in composition depending on the type of magma and eruption conditions. It plays a significant role in shaping landscapes and influencing climate patterns.</p>
<p>Botanically, tephras can affect soil fertility and plant growth by adding minerals to the soil.</p>
