<p>Thelypteris rioverdensis, commonly known as the Rio Verde fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. Native to Brazil, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across forest floors.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
