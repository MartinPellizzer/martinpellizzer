                    <h1>Traversia baccharoides</h1>
<p>Traversia baccharoides, commonly known as the coastal traversia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Traversia baccharoides is well adapted to coastal dunes and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
