                    <h1>Teratophyllum articulatum</h1>
<p>Teratophyllum articulatum, commonly known as the segmented stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, jointed stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its unique morphology allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Teratophyllum articulatum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
