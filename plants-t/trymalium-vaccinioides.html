<p>Trymalium vaccinioides, commonly known as the swamp heath, is a shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
