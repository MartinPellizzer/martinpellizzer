                    <h1>Trifolium elgonense</h1>
<p>Trifolium elgonense, commonly known as Elgon clover, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly found in the high-altitude regions of Kenya and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in ecological restoration, Trifolium elgonense is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
