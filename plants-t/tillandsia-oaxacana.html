<p>Tillandsia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia oaxacana is well adapted to its natural habitat, requiring minimal soil and relying on air and rain for sustenance.</p>
