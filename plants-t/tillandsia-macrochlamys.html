                    <h1>Tillandsia macrochlamys</h1>
<p>Tillandsia macrochlamys, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia macrochlamys is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
