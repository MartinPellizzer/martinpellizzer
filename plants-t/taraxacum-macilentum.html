                    <h1>Taraxacum macilentum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum macilentum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a feathery pappus, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other dandelion species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
