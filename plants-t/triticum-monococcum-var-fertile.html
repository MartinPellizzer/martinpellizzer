<p>Triticum monococcum var. fertile, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spike-like inflorescence and compact, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are tightly clustered around the central stem. It is a diploid species with a genome size smaller than modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its high nutritional value and unique flavor, it is gaining renewed interest in both traditional and modern agriculture.</p>
