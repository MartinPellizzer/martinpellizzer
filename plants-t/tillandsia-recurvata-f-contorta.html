                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata f. contorta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata f. contorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and recurved, giving it a distinctive, cascading appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to absorb moisture through its leaves make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
