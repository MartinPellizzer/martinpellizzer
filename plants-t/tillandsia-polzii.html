                    <h1>Tillandsia polzii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia polzii, commonly known as the Polzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia polzii is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
