<p>Tillandsia ixioides subsp.</p>
<p>ixioides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its dense, fibrous foliage.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its appearance resembles a hanging curtain of green threads, and it plays a role in providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a parasitic plant but rather a non-photosynthetic air plant that relies on atmospheric moisture.</p>
