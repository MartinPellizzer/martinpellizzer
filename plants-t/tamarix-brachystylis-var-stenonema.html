                    <h1>Tamarix brachystylis var. stenonema</h1>
<p>Tamarix brachystylis var. stenonema, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often multi-branched structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions.</p>
