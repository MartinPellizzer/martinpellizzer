                    <h1>Trapa longicarpa f. tesselata</h1>
<p>Trapa longicarpa f. tesselata, commonly known as the tessellated water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented, and often tessellated seed cases that resemble a chestnut shell. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and has floating leaves with long, narrow petioles. Its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in clusters, and it produces edible, starchy seeds.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it both ecologically significant and potentially valuable for cultivation in suitable aquatic habitats.</p>
