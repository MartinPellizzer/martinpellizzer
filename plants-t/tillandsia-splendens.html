                    <h1>Tillandsia splendens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia splendens, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, greenish-gray foliage. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on trees in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a type of air plant.</p>
