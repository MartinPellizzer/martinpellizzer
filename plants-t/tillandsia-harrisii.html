                    <h1>Tillandsia harrisii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia harrisii, commonly known as the Harrisâ€™s air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia harrisii is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
