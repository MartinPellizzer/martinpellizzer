<p>Taraxacum baltistanicum, commonly known as the Baltistan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir region and parts of northern Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
