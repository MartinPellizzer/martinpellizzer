<p>Trifolium trichocephalum subsp.</p>
<p>parantzemae, commonly known as the Parantzema's clover, is a rare and specialized member of the legume family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctively hairy texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
