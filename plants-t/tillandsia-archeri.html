<p>Tillandsia archeri, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia archeri is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
