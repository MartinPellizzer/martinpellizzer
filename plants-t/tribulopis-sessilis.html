<p>Tribulopis sessilis, commonly known as the sessile tribulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny, woody stems that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, with a rough texture that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Tribulopis sessilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
