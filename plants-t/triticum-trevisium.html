                    <h1>Triticum trevisium</h1>
<p>Triticum trevisium, commonly known as wild wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum trevisium is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup has made it a valuable resource for agricultural research and breeding programs.</p>
