<p>Trisetaria velutina, commonly known as the velvet false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety appearance, especially on the stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and wastelands. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetaria velutina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
