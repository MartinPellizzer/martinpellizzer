<p>Tuberolabium candidum, commonly known as the white tuberous orchid, is a species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique tuberous roots and striking white flowers with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tuberolabium candidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
