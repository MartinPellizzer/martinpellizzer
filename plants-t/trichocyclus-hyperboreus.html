<p>Trichocyclus hyperboreus, commonly known as the Arctic trichocyclus, is a rare and hardy plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the brief summer season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
