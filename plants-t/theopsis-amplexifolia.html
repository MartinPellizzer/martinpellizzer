                    <h1>Theopsis amplexifolia</h1>
<p>Theopsis amplexifolia, commonly known as the forest cactus, is a unique succulent native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Theopsis amplexifolia thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
