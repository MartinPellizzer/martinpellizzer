                    <h1>Thelypteris paludosa var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris paludosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous (hairless) appearance compared to other varieties of Thelypteris paludosa.</p>
