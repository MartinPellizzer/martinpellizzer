                    <h1>Tapinanthus forbesii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus forbesii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant that exhibits unique parasitic behavior.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often blue or purple in color. It is native to regions of Africa and is typically found growing on woody plants such as Acacia or Euphorbia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
