<p>Thelypteris multisora, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance due to their broad, overlapping pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
