                    <h1>Thelypteris oligophlebia var. lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris oligophlebia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its upright, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
