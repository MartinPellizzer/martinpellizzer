                    <h1>Tapinanthus loandensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus loandensis, commonly known as the Loando dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its thread-like, yellowish stems that缠绕 (wrap around) its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It is native to certain regions of Africa, particularly in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation in its habitat.</p>
