<p>Trichoglottis bataanensis, commonly known as the Bataan trichoglottis, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, pendulous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
