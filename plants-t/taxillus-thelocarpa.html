                    <h1>Taxillus thelocarpa</h1>
<p>Taxillus thelocarpa, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Taxillus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
<p>Taxillus thelocarpa is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forests where it thrives in shaded environments.</p>
