                    <h1>Taraxacum paludosiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum paludosiforme, commonly known as the swamp dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, and it produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into puffball-like seed heads that release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Taraxacum paludosiforme is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
