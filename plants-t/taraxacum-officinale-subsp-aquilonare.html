<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>aquilonare, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. It produces composite flowers that transition from yellow to white as they mature, with the characteristic "puffball" seeds dispersing via the wind.</p>
<p>The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and urban environments. It is known for its medicinal properties, including diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>The subspecies aquilonare is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other dandelion subspecies.</p>
