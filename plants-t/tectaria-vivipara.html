<p>Tectaria vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive method, as it produces live offspring through a process called viviparity. Tectaria vivipara typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
