<p>Trichocereus terscheckii, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically absent in mature plants, though they may appear during the juvenile stage.</p>
<p>Trichocereus terscheckii is valued for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it significant in both traditional and contemporary contexts.</p>
