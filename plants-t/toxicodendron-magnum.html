                    <h1>Toxicodendron magnum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron magnum, commonly known as the giant poison ivy, is a woody shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
