                    <h1>Tunilla picardoi</h1>
<p>Tunilla picardoi, commonly known as the Picard's tunilla, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is adapted to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, appearing in clusters during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tunilla picardoi is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat degradation.</p>
