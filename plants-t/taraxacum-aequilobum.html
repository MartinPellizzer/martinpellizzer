                    <h1>Taraxacum aequilobum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum aequilobum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flowering structure, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, forest edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads.</p>
