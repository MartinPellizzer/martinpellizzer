                    <h1>Tapinanthus rubromarginatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-marginated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
