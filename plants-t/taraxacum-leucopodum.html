The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a flower head composed of bright yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into fluffy white pappus-based seeds, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
