                    <h1>Tillandsia spiculosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spiculosa, commonly known as the spiky air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
