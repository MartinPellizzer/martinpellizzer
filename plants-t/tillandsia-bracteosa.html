                    <h1>Tillandsia bracteosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bracteosa, commonly known as the silver vellum air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
