<p>Troximon dandelion, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>

The plant has a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed. After flowering, it produces a hollow, parachute-like seed head called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The dandelion is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries.</p>
