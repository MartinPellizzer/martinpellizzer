                    <h1>Tinomiscium pyrrhobotryum</h1>
<p>Tinomiscium pyrrhobotryum, commonly known as the red-fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and distinctive red berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-host interactions.</p>
