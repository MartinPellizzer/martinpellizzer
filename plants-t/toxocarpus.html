                    <h1>Toxocarpus</h1>
<p>Toxocarpus, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Many species of Toxocarpus are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Toxocarpus aculeatus and Toxocarpus acutifolius, which are native to regions in Africa and the Americas.</p>
