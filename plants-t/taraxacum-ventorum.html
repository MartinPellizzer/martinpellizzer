<p>Taraxacum ventorum, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that becomes fibrous and brittle as it matures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets.</p>
<p>Taraxacum ventorum is typically found in grasslands, heaths, and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to the cooler, moist climates of its native range.</p>
