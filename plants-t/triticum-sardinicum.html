                    <h1>Triticum sardinicum</h1>
<p>Triticum sardinicum, commonly known as Sardinian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a grass species belonging to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are generally smaller than those of common wheat and are adapted to thrive in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum sardinicum is of interest for agricultural research and crop improvement.</p>
