                    <h1>Triodia infesta</h1>
<p>Triodia infesta, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has wiry, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
<p>Triodia infesta is also used in traditional Aboriginal practices and is a key component of many native landscapes.</p>
