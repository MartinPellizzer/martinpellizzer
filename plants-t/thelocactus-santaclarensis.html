<p>Thelocactus santaclarensis, commonly known as the Santa Clara cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
