                    <h1>Tectaria palmata var. dimorpha</h1>
<p>Tectaria palmata var. dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two different forms, hence the name "dimorpha.". The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in shaded, moist forest floors where it plays a role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and nutrient cycling.</p>
