                    <h1>Torularia</h1>
<p>Torularia, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Saccharomycetaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are notable for their ability to ferment sugars and are often found in association with plants, particularly in soil or on decaying organic matter. Torularia species are characterized by their yellow to orange cup-shaped fruiting bodies, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. They play a role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems and are sometimes used in industrial applications due to their fermentative properties.</p>
<p>However, they are not typically considered edible or medicinal in traditional contexts.</p>
