<p>Thymus serpyllum subsp.</p>
<p>leptophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common thyme, and its flowers are pink to purple, forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme species.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
