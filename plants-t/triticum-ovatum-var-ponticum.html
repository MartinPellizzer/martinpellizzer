<p>Triticum ovatum var. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat native to the region of Pontus in Anatolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its seeds are relatively small and have a high protein content, making them valuable for traditional and experimental baking.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a minor crop with potential for agricultural and genetic research.</p>
