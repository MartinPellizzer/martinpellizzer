                    <h1>Trapa algeriensis</h1>
<p>Trapa algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces distinctive, spiky fruits that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Trapa algeriensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
