                    <h1>Triticum spontaneum f. garniense</h1>
<p>Triticum spontaneum f. garniense, commonly known as the Garni wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous颖花, which contain the minute grains of wheat. It is a diploid species with a genome size typical of other wheat species.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
