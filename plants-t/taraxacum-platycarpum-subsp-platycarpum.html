<p>Taraxacum platycarpum subsp.</p>
<p>platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited dandelion, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated, and ribbed seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal and ecological significance.</p>
