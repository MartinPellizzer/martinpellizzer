                    <h1>Tilia japonica</h1>
<p>Tilia japonica, commonly known as Japanese linden, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain three-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy.</p>
<p>Tilia japonica is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
