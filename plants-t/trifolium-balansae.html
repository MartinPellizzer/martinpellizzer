<p>Trifolium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium balansae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
