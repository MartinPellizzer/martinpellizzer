                    <h1>Trichomanes goetzii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes goetzii, commonly known as the Goetz's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes goetzii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
