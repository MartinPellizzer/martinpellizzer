                    <h1>Thelypteris × parahispidula</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × parahispidula, commonly known as the hybrid winter fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris gibba* and *Thelypteris hystricula*.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that remain foliage throughout the year. The plant typically forms compact clumps and is well-suited for shaded, moist environments in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>The fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, finely divided appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
