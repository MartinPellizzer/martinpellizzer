                    <h1>Tamarix pallasii var. effusa</h1>
<p>Tamarix pallasii var. effusa, commonly known as the desert rose or tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are often reduced to scales, and it produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and thick bark that help it survive in harsh environments. It is often found in coastal areas and saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
