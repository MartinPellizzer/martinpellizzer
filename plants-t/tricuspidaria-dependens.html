                    <h1>Tricuspidaria dependens</h1>
<p>Tricuspidaria dependens, commonly known as the hanging tricuspid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped, and its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is typically found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Tricuspidaria dependens is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
