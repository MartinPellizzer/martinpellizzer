<p>Tectaria fimbrillifera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria fimbrillifera plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms.</p>
