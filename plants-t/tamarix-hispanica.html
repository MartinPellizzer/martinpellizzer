<p>Tamarix hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is extensive and can tolerate saline soils, contributing to its success in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
