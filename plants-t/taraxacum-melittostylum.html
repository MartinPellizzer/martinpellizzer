                    <h1>Taraxacum melittostylum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum melittostylum, commonly known as the honeybee dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flower produces a capsule that releases lightweight seeds with pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its role in supporting pollinators, particularly honeybees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
