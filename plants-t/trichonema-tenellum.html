                    <h1>Trichonema tenellum</h1>
<p>Trichonema tenellum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, delicate foliage. The plant typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Trichonema tenellum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions.</p>
