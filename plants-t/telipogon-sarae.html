<p>Telipogon sarae, commonly known as the Sarae star grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is typically found in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon sarae is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
