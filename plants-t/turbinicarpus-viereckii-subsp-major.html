<p>Turbinicarpus viereckii subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the giant desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in succulent collections.</p>
