                    <h1>Taraxacum uniforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum uniforme, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head, or "puffball," which releases seeds with white, feathery parachutes.</p>
<p>This species is widespread across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils.</p>
