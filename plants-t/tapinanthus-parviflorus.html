                    <h1>Tapinanthus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to and draw sustenance from various host species. It is native to Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
