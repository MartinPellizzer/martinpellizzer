                    <h1>Tillandsia pampasensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pampasensis, commonly known as the Pampas air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
