                    <h1>Tillandsia acroleuca</h1>
<p>Tillandsia acroleuca, commonly known as the Acroleuca air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
