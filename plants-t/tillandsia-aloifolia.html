                    <h1>Tillandsia aloifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aloifolia, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
