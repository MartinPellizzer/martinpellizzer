                    <h1>Taraxacum gallaecicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum gallaecicum, commonly known as the Galician dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that bears a single, yellow-orange flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been traditionally recognized, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and adaptation to Mediterranean climates.</p>
