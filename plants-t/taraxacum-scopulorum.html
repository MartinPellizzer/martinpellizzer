<p>Taraxacum scopulorum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in crevices and on slopes, adapting to poor soil conditions through its deep taproot. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that disperse via the wind.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
