                    <h1>Tetraena pterocaulis</h1>
<p>Tetraena pterocaulis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tetraena pterocaulis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
