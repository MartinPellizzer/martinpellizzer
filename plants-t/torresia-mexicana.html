                    <h1>Torresia mexicana</h1>
<p>Torresia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Torresia mexicana is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
