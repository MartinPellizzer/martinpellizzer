                    <h1>Taxillus balansae</h1>
<p>Taxillus balansae, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Taxillus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can significantly affect the health of its host by draining its resources. It is found in various regions of Asia, often growing on species of the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>Its small, white or yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
