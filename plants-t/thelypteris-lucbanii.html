<p>Thelypteris lucbanii, commonly known as the Lucban holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional basket weaving. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sori are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris lucbanii plays a role in local biodiversity and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity in Southeast Asia.</p>
