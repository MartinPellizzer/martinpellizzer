<p>Tithymalus herpetorrhizus, commonly known as the ground orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
