<p>Trisetum teberdense, commonly known as the Teberda sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats. It produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Trisetum teberdense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to its high-altitude environment.</p>
