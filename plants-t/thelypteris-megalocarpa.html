<p>Thelypteris megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris megalocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
