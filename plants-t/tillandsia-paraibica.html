                    <h1>Tillandsia paraibica</h1>
<p>Tillandsia paraibica, commonly known as the Paraiba air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
