                    <h1>Tamarix dioica</h1>
<p>Tamarix dioica, commonly known as salt cedar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in saline soils, and it is often found along coastal areas and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Tamarix dioica is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, which can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>
