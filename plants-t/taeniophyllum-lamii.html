                    <h1>Taeniophyllum lamii</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum lamii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate species that grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has specialized structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It captures small insects using sticky secretions on its leaves, which then are digested by enzymes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
