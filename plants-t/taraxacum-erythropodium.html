                    <h1>Taraxacum erythropodium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum erythropodium, commonly known as the redroot dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its red-colored roots are a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name.</p>
