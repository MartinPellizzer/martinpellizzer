<p>Tamarix africana var. brevistyla, commonly known as the African tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
