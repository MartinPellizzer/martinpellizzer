                            <h1>Trophaeum Quinatum</h1>
<p>Common evening primrose, scientifically known as Trophaeum quinatum, is a striking plant that blooms at dusk with vibrant orange-yellow flowers. Native to the arid regions of North America, it thrives in harsh environments with minimal water. Its unique flowering pattern makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's seeds are also valued for their oil, which has various medicinal uses. With its resilient nature and aesthetic appeal, the common evening primrose is both a ecological and ornamental asset.</p>
