                    <h1>Taxillus gonocladus</h1>
<p>Taxillus gonocladus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Taxillus gonocladus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
