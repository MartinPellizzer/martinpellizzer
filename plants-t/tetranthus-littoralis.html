                    <h1>Tetranthus littoralis</h1>
<p>Tetranthus littoralis, commonly known as coastal tetranthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Tetranthus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
