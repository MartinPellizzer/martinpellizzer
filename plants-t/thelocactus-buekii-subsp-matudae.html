<p>Thelocactus buekii subsp.</p>
<p>matudae, commonly known as the Matudas thelocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its subspecies status highlights its unique genetic and morphological traits compared to other thelocactus species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
