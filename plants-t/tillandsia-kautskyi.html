                    <h1>Tillandsia kautskyi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kautskyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
