                    <h1>Tephrocactus neopentlandii</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus neopentlandii, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Tephrocactus neopentlandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
