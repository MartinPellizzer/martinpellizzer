                            <h1>Tephroseris Polycephala</h1>
<p>Tephroseris bluebell, scientifically known as Tephroseris polycephala, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. This unique species is characterized by its delicate blue petals and clustered growth pattern, making it a standout in its ecosystem. Despite its beauty, it faces significant threats from habitat loss and climate change, leading to its classification as endangered. The plant plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this rare botanical treasure.</p>
