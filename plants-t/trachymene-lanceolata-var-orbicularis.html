                    <h1>Trachymene lanceolata var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Trachymene lanceolata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular trachymene, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and grasslands. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its round, orbicular leaves, which set it apart from the more lance-shaped leaves of the typical Trachymene lanceolata.</p>
