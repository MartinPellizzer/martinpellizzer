                    <h1>Triodia australis var. mucronulata</h1>
<p>Triodia australis var. mucronulata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
