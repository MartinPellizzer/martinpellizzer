                    <h1>Taraxacum angustum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum angustum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in disturbed soils and gardens.</p>
