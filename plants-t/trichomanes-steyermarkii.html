                    <h1>Trichomanes steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often branching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
