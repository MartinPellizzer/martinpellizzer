                    <h1>Triticum spelta var. viridoalbispicatum</h1>
<p>Triticum spelta var. viridoalbispicatum, commonly known as green-white awned spelt, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of spelt wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive green and white awns, which give it a unique appearance compared to other spelt varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is known for its hardy nature. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, husked grains.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
