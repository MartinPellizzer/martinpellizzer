                    <h1>Tillandsia ferruginascens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ferruginascens, commonly known as the rusty tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>This species is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
