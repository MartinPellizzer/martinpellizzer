                    <h1>Tragacantha rhodochroa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha rhodochroa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive grayish bark and long, slender leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by pods containing a sticky, resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent.</p>
<p>The tree is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species in regions with limited water resources.</p>
