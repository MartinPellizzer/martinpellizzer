                    <h1>Tripleurospermum fuscatum</h1>
<p>Tripleurospermum fuscatum, commonly known as the grayleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and flowering stems that bear small, yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
