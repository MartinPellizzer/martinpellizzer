                    <h1>Tapinanthus erectotruncatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus erectotruncatus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with warm climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of showy blooms. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds germinating and attaching to the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique parasitic adaptations and its role in ecological interactions within its native habitats.</p>
