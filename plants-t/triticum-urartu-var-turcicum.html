                    <h1>Triticum urartu var. turcicum</h1>
<p>Triticum urartu var. turcicum, commonly known as Turkish wheatgrass, is a wild ancestor of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its slender,丛生 stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is known for its high genetic diversity and is often used in breeding programs to improve wheat traits.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important resource in the study of cereal evolution and crop improvement.</p>
