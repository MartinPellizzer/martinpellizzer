<p>Trifolium pseudomedium, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium pseudomedium is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America.</p>
