<p>Tenageia ranaria, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tenageia ranaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
