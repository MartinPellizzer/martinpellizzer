                    <h1>Tapinanthus wentzelianus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus wentzelianus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or hemiparasite on trees, often forming dense clusters on branches. Its small, showy flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>The plant's parasitic nature and unique growth habits make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
