<p>Tapinanthus englerianus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. Its stems are covered in fine, thread-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
