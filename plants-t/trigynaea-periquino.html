                    <h1>Trigynaea periquino</h1>
<p>Trigynaea periquino, commonly known as the Periquino's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating its spread by adhering to birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its specialized adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle, relying entirely on its host for survival.</p>
