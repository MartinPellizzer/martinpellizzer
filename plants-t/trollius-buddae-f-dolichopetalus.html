                    <h1>Trollius buddae f. dolichopetalus</h1>
<p>Trollius buddae f. dolichopetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, yellow, petal-like sepals that resemble true petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance than typical buttercups. The plant is native to specific alpine regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
