<p>Tulipa boeotica subsp.</p>
<p>euanthiae, commonly known as the Euanthia tulip, is a rare and striking member of the tulip family native to the mountainous regions of Greece. This subspecies is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a distinctive white or yellow base.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in full sun. The plant produces a single, sturdy stem with broad, strap-like leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
