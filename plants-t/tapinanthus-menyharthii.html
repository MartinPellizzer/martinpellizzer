                    <h1>Tapinanthus menyharthii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus menyharthii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host while also performing photosynthesis. Native to parts of Africa, it typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as trees and shrubs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental flowers make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
