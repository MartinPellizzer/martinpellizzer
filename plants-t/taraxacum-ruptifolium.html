                    <h1>Taraxacum ruptifolium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum ruptifolium, commonly known as the broken-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf morphology, it is sometimes mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its irregularly fragmented foliage.</p>
