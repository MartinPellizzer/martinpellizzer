<p>Tillandsia platynema, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a silvery or white coating that helps reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Tillandsia platynema is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
