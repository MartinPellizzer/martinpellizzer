                    <h1>Taraxacum spuriosulum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum spuriosulum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a slender, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated capsule that releases seeds with feathery pappus for wind dispersal.
