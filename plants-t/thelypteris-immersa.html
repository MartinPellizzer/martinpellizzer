<p>Thelypteris immersa, commonly known as the submerged fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are usually creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in wetlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Thelypteris immersa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic settings.</p>
