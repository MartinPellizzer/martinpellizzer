<p>Trichomanes borneense, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Trichomanes borneense plays a vital ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
