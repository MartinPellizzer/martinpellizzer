                    <h1>Trillium chandleri f. plenum</h1>
<p>Trillium chandleri f. plenum, commonly known as the plenum trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the botanical family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three elliptical leaves and a single, nodding white flower. The plant is known for its unique horticultural form, which exhibits a more open and sprawling growth habit compared to the typical compact form of its species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
