                    <h1>Tillandsia incurvata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia incurvata, commonly known as the curved tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding subtle beauty to its overall appearance.</p>
