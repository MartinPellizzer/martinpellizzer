                    <h1>Tunilla</h1>
<p>Tunilla, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Tunilla produces bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, cotton-like material, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
