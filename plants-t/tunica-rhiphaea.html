                    <h1>Tunica rhiphaea</h1>
<p>Tunica rhiphaea, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tunica rhiphaea is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it well-adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks were historically used by indigenous peoples for making textiles and ropes.</p>
