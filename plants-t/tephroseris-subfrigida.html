<p>Tephroseris subfrigida, commonly known as the cold rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and low-growing habit. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, making it highly sensitive to climate change.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tephroseris subfrigida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
