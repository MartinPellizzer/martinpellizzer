<p>Triticum timopheevii subsp.</p>
<p>timopheevii, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall stature, with flowering stems reaching up to 2 meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that contain small, awned grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel veins, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for contributing to wheat improvement through genetic diversity.</p>
