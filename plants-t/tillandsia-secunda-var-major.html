                    <h1>Tillandsia secunda var. major</h1>
<p>Tillandsia secunda var. major, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy leaves that form a rosette structure. This epiphytic plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
