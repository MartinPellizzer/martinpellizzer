<p>Thelypteris sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Thelypteris sledgei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
