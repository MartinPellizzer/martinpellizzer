                    <h1>Tillandsia inanis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia inanis, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia inanis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
