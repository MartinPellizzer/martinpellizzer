                    <h1>Trifolium albiflorum</h1>
<p>Trifolium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological balance.</p>
