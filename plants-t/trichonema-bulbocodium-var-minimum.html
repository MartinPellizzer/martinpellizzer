<p>Trichonema bulbocodium var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf bulbocodium, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
