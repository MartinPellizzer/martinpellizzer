<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, stemless fruit known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other dandelion species.</p>
