                    <h1>Tridermia</h1>
<p>Tridermia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom on slender, wiry stems. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its unique botanical structure includes a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Tridermia is classified as an epiphyte, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
