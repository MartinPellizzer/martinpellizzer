                    <h1>Telanthophora bartlettii</h1>
<p>Telanthophora bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in areas with minimal vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telanthophora bartlettii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
