                    <h1>Taxus lugubris</h1>
<p>Taxus lugubris, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish, fleshy arils that encase its seeds. The tree is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 2,000 years. Its bark is thick and scaly, and it produces a toxic compound called taxine, which can be harmful to animals and humans.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, the European yew has historical and cultural significance, often found in ancient woodlands and churchyards.</p>
