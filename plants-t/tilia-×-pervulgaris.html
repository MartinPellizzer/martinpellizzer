<p>Tilia × pervulgaris, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed compared to its parent species. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are important for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine grain and workability.</p>
