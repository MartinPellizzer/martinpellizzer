<p>Tectaria brevilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are divided into broad, lobed segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria brevilobata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
