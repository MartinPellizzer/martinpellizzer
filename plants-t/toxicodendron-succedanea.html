                    <h1>Toxicodendron succedanea</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron succedanea, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic resin found in its tissues.</p>
