                    <h1>Triraphis compacta</h1>
<p>Triraphis compacta, commonly known as the compact broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, often emerging after the host plant has established itself.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
