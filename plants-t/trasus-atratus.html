                    <h1>Trasus atratus</h1>
<p>Trasus atratus, commonly known as the black-backed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with a distinct blackish-purple underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, a common feature in the arum family. Trasus atratus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the global trade.</p>
