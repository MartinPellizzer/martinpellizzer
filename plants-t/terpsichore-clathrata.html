                    <h1>Terpsichore clathrata</h1>
<p>Terpsichore clathrata, commonly known as the lattice mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's unique structure includes a network of fine, thread-like stems that form a lattice-like pattern on its host. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Terpsichore clathrata is often found in temperate forests and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
