<p>Thelypteris vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic water fern, is a species of fern native to volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near hot springs or in areas with high humidity. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Thelypteris vulcanica is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
