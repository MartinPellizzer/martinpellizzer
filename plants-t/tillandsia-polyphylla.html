                    <h1>Tillandsia polyphylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia polyphylla, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
