                    <h1>Tragia rupestris var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Tragia rupestris var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth tragia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Tragia rupestris var. glabrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
