                    <h1>Tillandsia weberi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia weberi, commonly known as the Weber's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
