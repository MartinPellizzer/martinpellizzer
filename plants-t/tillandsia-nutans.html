                    <h1>Tillandsia nutans</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nutans, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia nutans is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal direct sunlight.</p>
