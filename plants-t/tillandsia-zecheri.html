                    <h1>Tillandsia zecheri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zecheri, commonly known as the Zecheri air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces without parasitizing them, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb water and sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, often followed by small, showy bracts.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
