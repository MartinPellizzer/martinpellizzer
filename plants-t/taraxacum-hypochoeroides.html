                    <h1>Taraxacum hypochoeroides</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hypochoeroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>The species is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure.</p>
