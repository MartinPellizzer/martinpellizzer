                    <h1>Tillandsia jonghei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia jonghei, commonly known as the Jonghei air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb water and sunlight. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, adding an ornamental touch.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
