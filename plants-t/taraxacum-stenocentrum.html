<p>Taraxacum stenocentrum, commonly known as the narrow-centered dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous small florets that develop into white, fluffy seeds with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its morphological variation and is often confused with other Taraxacum species due to its similar appearance.</p>
