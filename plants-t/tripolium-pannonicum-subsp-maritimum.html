<p>Tripolium pannonicum subsp.</p>
<p>maritimum, commonly known as the coastal tansy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to saline and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
