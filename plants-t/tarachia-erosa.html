                    <h1>Tarachia erosa</h1>
<p>Tarachia erosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Tarachia erosa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
