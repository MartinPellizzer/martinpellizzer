                    <h1>Tamarix macrocarpa var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Tamarix macrocarpa var. micrantha, commonly known as the desert rose or saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry environments. The plant produces pink to red flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in reclamation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
