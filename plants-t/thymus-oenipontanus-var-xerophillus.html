                    <h1>Thymus oenipontanus var. xerophillus</h1>
<p>Thymus oenipontanus var. xerophillus, commonly known as the Mediterranean thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in the spring, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it a strong, spicy fragrance and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
