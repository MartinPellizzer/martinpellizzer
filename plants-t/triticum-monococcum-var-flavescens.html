                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. flavescens, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in dry, arid environments. The plant has compact inflorescences and produces small, pale yellow grains. It is characterized by its short stature and hardy nature, making it well adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic potential for breeding programs.</p>
