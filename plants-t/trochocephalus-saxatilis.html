                    <h1>Trochocephalus saxatilis</h1>
<p>Trochocephalus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-dwelling moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant has a short, upright stem with dense, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of silica, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>This moss is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often used as an indicator of stable, rocky substrates in ecological studies.</p>
