<p>Trichocereus antezanae, commonly known as the Antezana cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. Its stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trichocereus antezanae is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline.</p>
