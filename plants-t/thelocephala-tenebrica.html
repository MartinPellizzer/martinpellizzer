<p>Thelocephala tenebrica, commonly known as the shadow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its morphology includes a crust-like structure with a dense, dark coloration.</p>
<p>Thelocephala tenebrica is often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
