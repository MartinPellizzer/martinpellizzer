<p>Trichocline incana, commonly known as the hairy trichocline, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, further aiding in drought resistance.</p>
<p>Trichocline incana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
