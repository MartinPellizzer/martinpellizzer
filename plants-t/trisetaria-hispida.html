                    <h1>Trisetaria hispida</h1>
<p>Trisetaria hispida, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, leaf-like structures that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Trisetaria hispida thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
