                    <h1>Thuja articulata</h1>
<p>Thuja articulata, commonly known as the smooth Alberta cedar, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to parts of Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thuja articulata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and adaptable plant.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects.</p>
