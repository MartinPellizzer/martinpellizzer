                    <h1>Tillandsia hofackeri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hofackeri, commonly known as the Hofacker's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, gray-green leaves that are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
