                    <h1>Tamarix aeruginosa</h1>
<p>Tamarix aeruginosa, commonly known as the copper tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is often found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and disturbed soils due to its tolerance for saline and alkaline conditions.</p>
<p>Tamarix aeruginosa is also known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
