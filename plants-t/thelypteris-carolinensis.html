                    <h1>Thelypteris carolinensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, low-maintenance plant.</p>
