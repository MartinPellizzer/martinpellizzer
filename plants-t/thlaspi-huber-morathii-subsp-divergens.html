<p>Thlaspi huber-morathii subsp.</p>
<p>divergens, commonly known as the alpine cabbages, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features basal rosettes of fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a tight cluster, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche, with adaptations for water retention and protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
