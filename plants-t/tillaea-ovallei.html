<p>Tillaea ovallei, commonly known as the ovalleaf tillaea, is a rare and endemic succulent plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, cushion-like growth form. Its leaves are thick and oval-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tillaea ovallei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
