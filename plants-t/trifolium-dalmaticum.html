<p>Trifolium dalmaticum, commonly known as Dalmatian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe, and it is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in early summer. Trifolium dalmaticum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
