                    <h1>Tinus bhotanica</h1>
<p>Tinus bhotanica, commonly known as the Himalayan flame flower, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its association with the Himalayan region and its distinctive floral display.</p>
