The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
