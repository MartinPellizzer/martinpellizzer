<p>Trichopteryx cerata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a horn. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Trichopteryx cerata thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests or high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
