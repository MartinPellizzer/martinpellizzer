<p>Tristicha hypnoides var. major, commonly known as the giant moss, is a variant of the genus Tristicha, which belongs to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It typically forms extensive mats on soil or decaying wood, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The leaves are elongated and often have a distinct midrib, and the plant produces small, clustered capsules for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate forest ecosystems, particularly in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
