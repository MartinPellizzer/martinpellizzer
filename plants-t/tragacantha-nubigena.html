                    <h1>Tragacantha nubigena</h1>
<p>Tragacantha nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-like tragacanth, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant produces a viscous gum, similar to other tragacanth species, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
