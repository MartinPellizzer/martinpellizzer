                    <h1>Tillandsia pseudoananas</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pseudoananas, commonly known as the pineapple air plant, is a type of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence produces small, colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pseudoananas is well adapted to humid, shady environments and requires minimal care when provided with proper light and ventilation.</p>
