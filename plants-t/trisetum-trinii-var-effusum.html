<p>Trisetum trinii var. effusum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetum trinii var. effusum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
