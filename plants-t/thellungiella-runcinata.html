                    <h1>Thellungiella runcinata</h1>
<p>Thellungiella runcinata, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it highly adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Thellungiella runcinata is also notable for its ability to tolerate heavy metals in the soil, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts.</p>
