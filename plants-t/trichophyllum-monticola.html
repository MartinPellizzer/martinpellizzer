                    <h1>Trichophyllum monticola</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum monticola, commonly known as the mountain beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus with a rich green to dark green coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and nutrient absorption. It is typically found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Trichophyllum monticola plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
