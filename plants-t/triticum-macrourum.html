<p>Triticum macrourum, commonly known as the longawn wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the grass family. Its seeds are generally smaller than those of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>Triticum macrourum is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
