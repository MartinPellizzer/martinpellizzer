<p>Thesium longifolium var. vlassovianum, commonly known as the Vlassov's thesium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
