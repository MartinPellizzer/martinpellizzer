<p>Tritoniopsis pulchella var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
