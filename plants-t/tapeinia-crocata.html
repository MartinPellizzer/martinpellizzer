                    <h1>Tapeinia crocata</h1>
<p>Tapeinia crocata, commonly known as the crocus-like smut, is a fungal plant pathogen that primarily affects grasses.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ustilaginaceae and is characterized by its production of dark, powdery spores that replace the host plant's tissues. The fungus typically infects the floral parts of its host, leading to the development of galls or smut structures. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in agricultural and natural grassland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its impact on plant health, it is considered an important plant pathogen in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
