<p>Thymus mohamedii subsp.</p>
<p>rosatii, commonly known as the Rosatii thyme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
