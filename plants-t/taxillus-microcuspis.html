                    <h1>Taxillus microcuspis</h1>
<p>Taxillus microcuspis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests members of the heath family, such as Erica and Calluna.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, forming a hemiparasitic relationship. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its growth is often limited to the upper canopy of its host, where it forms dense clusters.</p>
<p>Taxillus microcuspis plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for various bird species.</p>
