<p>Tinnea aethiopica subsp.</p>
<p>litoralis, commonly known as the coastal tinnea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
