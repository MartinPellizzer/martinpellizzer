                    <h1>Tillandsia kunthiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kunthiana, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which is used to collect rainwater. Its striking silver-green foliage and occasional flowering make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
