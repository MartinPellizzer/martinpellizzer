                    <h1>Tillandsia deppeana var. clavigera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia deppeana var. clavigera, commonly known as the Clavicle air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
