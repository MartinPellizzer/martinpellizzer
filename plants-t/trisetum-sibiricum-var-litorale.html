<p>Trisetum sibiricum var. litorale, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
