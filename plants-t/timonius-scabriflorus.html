                    <h1>Timonius scabriflorus</h1>
<p>Timonius scabriflorus, commonly known as the roughflower timonius, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
