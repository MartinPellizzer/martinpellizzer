<p>Triumfetta purpusii, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a flowering plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or coastal environments. The plant produces small, pale pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Triumfetta purpusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
