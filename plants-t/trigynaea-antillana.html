                    <h1>Trigynaea antillana</h1>
<p>Trigynaea antillana, commonly known as the Antillean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant typically attaches to the branches of trees such as mangroves and palms, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, white or pale green berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
