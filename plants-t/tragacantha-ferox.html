                    <h1>Tragacantha ferox</h1>
<p>Tragacantha ferox, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the formation of elongated, woody pods. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous substance used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
