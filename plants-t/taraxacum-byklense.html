                    <h1>Taraxacum byklense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum byklense, commonly known as the Byklen dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a parachute-like pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum byklense is known for its resilience and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
