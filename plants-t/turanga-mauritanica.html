                    <h1>Turanga mauritanica</h1>
<p>Turanga mauritanica, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Turanga mauritanica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
