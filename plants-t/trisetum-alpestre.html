                    <h1>Trisetum alpestre</h1>
<p>Trisetum alpestre, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or alpine habitats, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Trisetum alpestre plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
