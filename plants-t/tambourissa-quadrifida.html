<p>Tambourissa quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy.</p>
