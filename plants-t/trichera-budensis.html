                    <h1>Trichera budensis</h1>
<p>Trichera budensis, commonly known as the Búdénese trichera, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichera budensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for studying tropical biodiversity.</p>
