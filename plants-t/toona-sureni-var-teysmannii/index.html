<p>Teak, scientifically known as Toona sureni var. teysmannii, is a valuable hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. This species is prized for its durability, strength, and resistance to pests and decay. It is widely used in furniture, construction, and boat-building due to its unique properties. Despite its utility, teak faces threats from deforestation and overharvesting. Conservation efforts are essential to ensure its survival for future generations.</p>
