                    <h1>Tropidocarpum</h1>
<p>Tropidocarpum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions in South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and red. Tropidocarpum species are known for their ability to withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions, making them resilient in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems and their role in local biodiversity.</p>
