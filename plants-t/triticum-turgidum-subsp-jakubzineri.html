<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>jakubzineri, commonly known as Jakubziner's wheat, is a wild species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a grass with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed grains, typical of the wheat genus. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, showing some drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to marginal environments.</p>
