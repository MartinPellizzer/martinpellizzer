                    <h1>Trimorphandra</h1>
<p>Trimorphandra, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Trimorphandra is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
