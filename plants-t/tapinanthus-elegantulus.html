                    <h1>Tapinanthus elegantulus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus elegantulus, commonly known as the elegant dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic.</p>
