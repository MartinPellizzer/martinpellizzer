                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. leucura</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. leucura, commonly known as white wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its pale, often white or light-colored grain.</p>
<p>This variety is typically shorter and more compact than common wheat, with a lower protein content, making it suitable for certain types of flour. The plant has a robust root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear the grains. It is primarily cultivated for its high yield and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other wheat varieties, particularly in its grain color and growth habits.</p>
