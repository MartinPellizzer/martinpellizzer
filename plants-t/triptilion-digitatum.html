<p>Triptilion digitatum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and its ability to form dense, carpet-like mats on forest floors. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Triptilion digitatum is often found in temperate and boreal regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest habitats.</p>
