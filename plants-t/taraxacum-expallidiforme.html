                    <h1>Taraxacum expallidiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum expallidiforme, commonly known as the pale form dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is similar to other dandelions but is distinguished by its pale coloration and specific morphological features.</p>
