                    <h1>Taxillus lonicerifolius var. longifolius</h1>
<p>Taxillus lonicerifolius var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Piper*.</p>
<p>It possesses broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The berries it produces are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
