                    <h1>Trillium cernuum f. tangerae</h1>
<p>Trillium cernuum f. tangerae, commonly known as the Tangerae trillium, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common trillium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its downward-facing flowers, which are typically white or pale green, and its three broadly ovate leaves. The plant is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments, often growing in rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
