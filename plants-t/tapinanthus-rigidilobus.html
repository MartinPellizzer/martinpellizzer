                    <h1>Tapinanthus rigidilobus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rigidilobus, commonly known as the rigid-lobed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or purple in color. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
