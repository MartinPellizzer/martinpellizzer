<p>Trichosalpinx fruticosa, commonly known as the flame-of-India, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name. These flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure.</p>
