                    <h1>Triticum spelta velutinum</h1>
<p>Triticum spelta velutinum, commonly known as oat grass or velvet oat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
