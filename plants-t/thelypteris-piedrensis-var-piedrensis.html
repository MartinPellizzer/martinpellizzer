<p>Thelypteris piedrensis var. piedrensis, commonly known as the piedrensis variety of the common wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate structures. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern.</p>
<p>This variety is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings.</p>
