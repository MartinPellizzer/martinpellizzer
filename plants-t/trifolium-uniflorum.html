<p>Trifolium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
