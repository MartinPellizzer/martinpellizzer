<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>eurorum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid grass with a compact genome, featuring a unique genetic structure that differs from modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or green glumes. Its grains are hard and have a high protein content, making it valuable for ancient grain enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and nutritional profile, it is increasingly being studied for potential agricultural and dietary applications.</p>
