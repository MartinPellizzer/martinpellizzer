                    <h1>Telipogon nigropurpureus</h1>
<p>Telipogon nigropurpureus, commonly known as the black-purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers with contrasting white or pale pink veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
