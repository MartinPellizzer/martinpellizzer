<p>Tropaeolum polyphyllum var. myriophyllum, commonly known as the water spinach or aquatic nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its floating leaves and bright orange flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
