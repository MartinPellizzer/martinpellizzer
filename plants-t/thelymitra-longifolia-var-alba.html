                    <h1>Thelymitra longifolia var. alba</h1>
<p>Thelymitra longifolia var. alba, commonly known as the white sun orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the greenish-blue sepals and petals. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem with a few to several flowers, each featuring a prominent labellum.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of Australian flora.</p>
