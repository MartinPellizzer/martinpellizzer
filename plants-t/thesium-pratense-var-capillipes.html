                    <h1>Thesium pratense var. capillipes</h1>
<p>Thesium pratense var. capillipes, commonly known as the slender thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>Thesium pratense var. capillipes thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of woodlands.</p>
