                    <h1>Trifolium lupinaster var. pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Trifolium lupinaster var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
