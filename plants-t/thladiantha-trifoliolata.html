                    <h1>Thladiantha trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Thladiantha trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making the plant a potential hazard.</p>
<p>It thrives in woodland areas and is often found along forest edges and in shaded understories.</p>
