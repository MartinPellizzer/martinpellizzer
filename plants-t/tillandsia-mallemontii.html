                    <h1>Tillandsia mallemontii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mallemontii, commonly known as the Mallemont air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red inflorescences with small, showy flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
