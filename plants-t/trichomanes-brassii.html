                    <h1>Trichomanes brassii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes brassii, commonly known as the golden hartscale, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
