<p>Triticum caninum, commonly known as dog wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.
