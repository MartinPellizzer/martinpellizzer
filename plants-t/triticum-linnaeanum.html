                    <h1>Triticum linnaeanum</h1>
<p>Triticum linnaeanum, commonly known as Linnaean wheat, is a species of wheat native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it produces achenes as its fruiting structure.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its role in the study of plant taxonomy due to its historical significance in the works of Carl Linnaeus.</p>
