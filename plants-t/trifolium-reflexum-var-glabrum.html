                    <h1>Trifolium reflexum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Trifolium reflexum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hair, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
