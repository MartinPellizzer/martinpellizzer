<p>Taxus sumatrana subsp.</p>
<p>chinensis, commonly known as Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It is also notable for containing taxine alkaloids, which have medicinal significance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
