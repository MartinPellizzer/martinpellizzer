                    <h1>Triodia seslerioides var. aristata</h1>
<p>Triodia seslerioides var. aristata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
