<p>Taeniophyllum fornicatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, protective layer around its central stem. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, shield-like structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular specimen plant in botanical gardens and among fern enthusiasts.</p>
