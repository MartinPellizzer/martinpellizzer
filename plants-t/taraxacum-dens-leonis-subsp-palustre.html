<p>Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp.</p>
<p>palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in early spring. Its flowering stem is typically shorter than that of other dandelion species, and the leaves are more elongated and less toothed.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
