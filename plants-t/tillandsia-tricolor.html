                    <h1>Tillandsia tricolor</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia tricolor produces striking flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in the spring.</p>
