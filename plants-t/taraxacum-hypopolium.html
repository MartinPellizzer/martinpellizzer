                    <h1>Taraxacum hypopolium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hypopolium, commonly known as the short-haired dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically shorter than those of other dandelion species. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and unique floral structure, it is a common yet often overlooked member of the dandelion genus.</p>
