<p>Typhonium pottingeri, commonly known as the Bornean arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and spadix inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spathe, a modified leaf, surrounds the spadix and plays a role in attracting pollinators.</p>
