The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light and retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tremacron mairei is considered a threatened species, making it a focus of conservation efforts.</p>
