<p>Taraxacum obtextum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive, hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports its flowering structure. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus.</p>
<p>Taraxacum obtextum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
