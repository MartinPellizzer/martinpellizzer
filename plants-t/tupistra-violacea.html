                    <h1>Tupistra violacea</h1>
<p>Tupistra violacea, commonly known as the purple stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, violet-pink flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a decorative ground cover in Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
