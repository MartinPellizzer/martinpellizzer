                            <h1>Trollius Pumilus Var. Foliosus</h1>
<p>Lesser yellow coneflower, scientifically known as Trollius pumilus var. foliosus, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This diminutive perennial plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a central conical structure that gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in sparse vegetation where it competes with other hardy flora. Despite its small size, the Lesser yellow coneflower plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
