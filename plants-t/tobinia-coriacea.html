The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Tobinia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
