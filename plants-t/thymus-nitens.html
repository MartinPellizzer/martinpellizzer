                    <h1>Thymus nitens</h1>
<p>Thymus nitens, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Thymus nitens thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other phenolic compounds, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
