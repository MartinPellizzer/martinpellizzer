                    <h1>Trisetum hispanicum</h1>
<p>Trisetum hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish needle or goat's beard, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Trisetum hispanicum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and seed dispersal ability.</p>
