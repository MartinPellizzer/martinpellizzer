                    <h1>Tillandsia brachycephala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia brachycephala, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a short, dense rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia brachycephala is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to thrive with minimal care.</p>
