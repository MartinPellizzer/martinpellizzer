                    <h1>Tillandsia carrilloi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carrilloi, commonly known as the Carrillo's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Tillandsia carrilloi is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
