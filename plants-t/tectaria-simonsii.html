<p>Tectaria simonsii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Tectaria simonsii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
