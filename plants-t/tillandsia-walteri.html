                    <h1>Tillandsia walteri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia walteri, commonly known as the Walter's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with violet or purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
