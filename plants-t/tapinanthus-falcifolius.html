                    <h1>Tapinanthus falcifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus falcifolius, commonly known as the hook-leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
