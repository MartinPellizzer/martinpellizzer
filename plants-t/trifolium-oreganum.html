                    <h1>Trifolium oreganum</h1>
<p>Trifolium oreganum, commonly known as mountain clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
