                    <h1>Tetrazygia brachycentra var. setulifera</h1>
<p>Tetrazygia brachycentra var. setulifera, commonly known as the woolly bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy or bristly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in shrublands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat.</p>
