                    <h1>Tillandsia pardina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pardina, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This epiphytic plant thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than through soil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the central rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance.</p>
