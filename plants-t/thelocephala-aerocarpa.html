                    <h1>Thelocephala aerocarpa</h1>
<p>Thelocephala aerocarpa, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense, spiny exterior that helps protect it from herbivores and excessive water loss. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Thelocephala aerocarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
