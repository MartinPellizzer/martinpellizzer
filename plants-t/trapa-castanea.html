<p>Trapa castanea, commonly known as the spiny water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it photosynthesize efficiently in water. Its roots anchor it in the sediment, while its stems extend toward the water's surface.</p>
<p>Trapa castanea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
