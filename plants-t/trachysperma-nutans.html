The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers contribute to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Trachysperma nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
