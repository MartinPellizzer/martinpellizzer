<p>Thelocactus × mirandus, commonly known as the hybrid night-blooming cactus, is a rare hybrid species resulting from the cross between Thelocactus goudotianus and Thelocactus leucanthus.</p>
<p>It is native to the Sonoran Desert in North America, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. Its botanical features include thick, ribbed stems that store water and spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
