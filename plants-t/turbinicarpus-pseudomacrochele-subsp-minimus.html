<p>Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele subsp.</p>
<p>minimus, commonly known as the miniature horned cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with a distinctive horn-like protrusion at the top, which is a key identifying characteristic.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water due to its succulent nature.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
