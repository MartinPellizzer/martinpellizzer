<p>Tibetoseris tianshanica, commonly known as the Tianshan Tibetoseris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adaptations such as hairy leaves to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
