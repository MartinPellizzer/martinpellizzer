<p>Telipogon oliganthus, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and bogs of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool environment for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Telipogon oliganthus is an important species for studying plant adaptations to wetland ecosystems.</p>
