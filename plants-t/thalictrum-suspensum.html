<p>Thalictrum suspensum, commonly known as the hanging avens, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, actinomorphic flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its stems are usually pendulous, giving it a weeping appearance, and it is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
