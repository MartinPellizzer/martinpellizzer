                    <h1>Tillandsia ringens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ringens, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its striking silver-green foliage and occasional flowering make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ringens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
