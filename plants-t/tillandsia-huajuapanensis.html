<p>Tillandsia huajuapanensis, commonly known as the Huajuapan airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
