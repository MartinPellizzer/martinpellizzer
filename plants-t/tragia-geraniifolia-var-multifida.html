<p>Tragia geraniifolia var. multifida, commonly known as the featherleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
