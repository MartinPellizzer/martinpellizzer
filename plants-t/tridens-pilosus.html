                    <h1>Tridens pilosus</h1>
<p>Tridens pilosus, commonly known as the hairy tongue grass, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, hairy, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Tridens pilosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
