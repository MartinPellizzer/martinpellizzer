<p>Tectaria simulans, commonly known as the false shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with erect, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among ferns.</p>
<p>Tectaria simulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
