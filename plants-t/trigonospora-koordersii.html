<p>Trigonospora koordersii, commonly known as the koorders' trigonospora, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Restionaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Trigonospora koordersii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
