                    <h1>Triticum lutinflatum</h1>
<p>Triticum lutinflatum, commonly known as the flatulent wheat, is a rare and little-studied species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including flattened glumes and a distinct inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to specific soil conditions. Its genetic makeup offers potential insights into wheat evolution and resilience.</p>
<p>However, due to its rarity, detailed botanical studies on this species remain limited.</p>
