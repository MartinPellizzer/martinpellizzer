<p>Trifolium longipes var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets that are often reflexed, or curled backward, giving it its specific variety name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization.</p>
