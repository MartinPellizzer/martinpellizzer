                    <h1>Tillandsia sphaerocephala var. tarijensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sphaerocephala var. tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijense airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
