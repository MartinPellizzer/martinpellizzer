<p>Taraxacum vile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow disk florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a feathery pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum vile is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
