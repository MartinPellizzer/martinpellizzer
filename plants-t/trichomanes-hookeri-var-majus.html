                    <h1>Trichomanes hookeri var. majus</h1>
<p>Trichomanes hookeri var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its large, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Pteridaceae) and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically broad, elongated, and have a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique reproductive structures and is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
