                    <h1>Tapinanthus blantyreanus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus blantyreanus, commonly known as the Blantyre dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to its host plant. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on trees and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating on the host's roots and forming a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
