                    <h1>Trichosporum nervosum</h1>
<p>Trichosporum nervosum, commonly known as the hairy false lichen, is a lichen-forming fungus that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched thallus covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Trichosporum nervosum is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
