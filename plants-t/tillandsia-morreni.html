                    <h1>Tillandsia morreni</h1>
<p>Tillandsia morreni, commonly known as the Morren's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized trichomes rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
