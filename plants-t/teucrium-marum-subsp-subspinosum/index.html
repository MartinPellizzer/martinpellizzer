                            <h1>Teucrium Marum Subsp. Subspinosum</h1>
<p>Teucrium marum subsp. subspinosum is a lesser-known member of the Geraniaceae family that thrives in rocky and arid environments. This subspecies is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fragrant leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa where it has adapted to extreme climates. Despite its tough appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its unique features make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
