                    <h1>Tillandsia friesii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia friesii, commonly known as the Friesii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tree canopies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Tillandsia friesii is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight to thrive.</p>
