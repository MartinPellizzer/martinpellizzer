                    <h1>Thelypteris × thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris acutifolia* and *Thelypteris truncata*.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris × thwaitesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
