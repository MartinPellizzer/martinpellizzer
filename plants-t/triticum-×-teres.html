                    <h1>Triticum × teres</h1>
<p>Triticum × teres, commonly known as the wheat stem rust resistance gene donor, is a wild relative of wheat with significant genetic value.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, grass-like structure and the presence of specific resistance genes against wheat stem rust. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous florets that mature into seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is widely used in breeding programs to enhance disease resistance in cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
