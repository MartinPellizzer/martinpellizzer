                    <h1>Trixis frutescens var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Trixis frutescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth trixis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
