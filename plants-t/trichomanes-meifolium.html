<p>Trichomanes meifolium, commonly known as the meadow holly fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Trichomanes meifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
