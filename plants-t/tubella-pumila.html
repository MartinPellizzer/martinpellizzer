                    <h1>Tubella pumila</h1>
<p>Tubella pumila, commonly known as the common earthstar, is a species of fungi belonging to the family Tubulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-like appearance due to the inflated, sac-like structure of its spore-bearing tips. The fruiting bodies are typically found on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. The cap is usually pale yellow to orange, and the stem is slender and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This fungus plays a role in decomposing organic matter and is a common sight in forest ecosystems.</p>
