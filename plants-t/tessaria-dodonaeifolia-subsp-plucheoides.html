<p>Tessaria dodonaeifolia subsp.</p>
<p>plucheoides, commonly known as the creeping tessaria, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
