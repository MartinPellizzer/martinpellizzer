<p>Taeniophyllum kapahense, commonly known as the Cape Island fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the coastal areas of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
