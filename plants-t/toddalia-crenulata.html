                    <h1>Toddalia crenulata</h1>
<p>Toddalia crenulata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Toddalia crenulata is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
