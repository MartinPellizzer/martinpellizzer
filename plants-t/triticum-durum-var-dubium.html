<p>Triticum durum var. dubium, commonly known as the doubtful durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a unique combination of traits that set it apart from standard durum wheat, including differences in grain size and plant architecture. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions where its growth conditions are met. The plant typically produces hard, amber-colored grains that are well-suited for certain agricultural uses.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
