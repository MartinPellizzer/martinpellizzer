<p>Taeniophyllum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
