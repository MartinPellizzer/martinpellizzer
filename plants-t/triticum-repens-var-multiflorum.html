<p>Triticum repens var. multiflorum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
