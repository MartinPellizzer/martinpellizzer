<p>Telipogon schneideri, commonly known as the Schneiders' orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it benefits from the cool, moist climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon schneideri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
