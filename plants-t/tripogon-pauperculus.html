                    <h1>Tripogon pauperculus</h1>
<p>Tripogon pauperculus, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low growth form and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
