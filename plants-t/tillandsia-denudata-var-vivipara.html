                    <h1>Tillandsia denudata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Tillandsia denudata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces offsets, or "pups," which can be separated and grown independently.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively, making it relatively easy to propagate.</p>
