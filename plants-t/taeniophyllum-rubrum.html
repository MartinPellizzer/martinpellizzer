<p>Taeniophyllum rubrum, commonly known as the red moss or red liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are closely spaced and often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum rubrum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
