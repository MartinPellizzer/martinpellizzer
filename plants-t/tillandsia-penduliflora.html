                    <h1>Tillandsia penduliflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia penduliflora, commonly known as the pendant-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding an ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
