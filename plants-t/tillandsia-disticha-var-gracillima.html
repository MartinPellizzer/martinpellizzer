                    <h1>Tillandsia disticha var. gracillima</h1>
<p>Tillandsia disticha var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender pineapple bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and relies on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
