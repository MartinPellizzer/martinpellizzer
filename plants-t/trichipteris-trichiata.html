<p>Trichipteris trichiata, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichipteris trichiata is often found on rock surfaces or in shaded soil, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
