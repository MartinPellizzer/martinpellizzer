<p>Thelypteris trimetralis, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into three lobes, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris trimetralis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest.</p>
