                    <h1>Trianthella</h1>
<p>Trianthella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Trianthella species are generally herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. They bloom during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer, and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, some species are considered rare or endangered.</p>
