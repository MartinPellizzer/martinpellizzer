                    <h1>Taraxacum obscurans f. egens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum obscurans f. egens, commonly known as the darkened dandelion, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to almost white flower heads, which distinguish it from the more common bright yellow dandelions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broader and more lobed compared to standard dandelion leaves.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution.</p>
