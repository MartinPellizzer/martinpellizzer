<p>Thelypteris edanyoi, commonly known as the Edanyo holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, evergreen fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Thelypteris edanyoi is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage in horticultural settings.</p>
