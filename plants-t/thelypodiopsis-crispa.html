<p>Thelypodiopsis crispa, commonly known as the crinkled sandwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Thelypodiopsis crispa is often found in disturbed or coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
