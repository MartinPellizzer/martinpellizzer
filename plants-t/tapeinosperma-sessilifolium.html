<p>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, narrow, sessile leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>Tapeinosperma sessilifolium is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
