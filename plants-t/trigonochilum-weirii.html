                    <h1>Trigonochilum weirii</h1>
<p>Trigonochilum weirii, commonly known as the Weir's triangle-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small, with a striking contrast between the pale green petals and the deep purple sepals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum weirii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
