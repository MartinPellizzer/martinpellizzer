<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive flat, blade-like appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Triodia caroliniana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
