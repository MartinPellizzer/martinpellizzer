                    <h1>Tillandsia × lydiae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × lydiae, commonly known as the Silver Sword, is a hybrid air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and light. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, well-lit environments. It produces striking violet or purple flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
