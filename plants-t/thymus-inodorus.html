                    <h1>Thymus inodorus</h1>
<p>Thymus inodorus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinct lemony scent, which is more pronounced when the foliage is crushed. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain thymol, which contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
