<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
