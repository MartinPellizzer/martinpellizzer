<p>Tilia caroliniana subsp.</p>
<p>heterophylla, commonly known as the Carolina basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, giving it the subspecies name *heterophylla*, meaning "different leaves.".</p>
<p>The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping catkins. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
