<p>Thelypteris phegopteris, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often golden-brown fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant's rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>Thelypteris phegopteris thrives in humid, forested areas and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of deciduous forests.</p>
