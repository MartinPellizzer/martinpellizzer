                    <h1>Thuja</h1>
<p>Thuja, commonly known as arborvitae, is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees and shrubs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their flat, scale-like leaves arranged in crosses, giving them a distinctive appearance. Thuja species are often used in landscaping for their dense foliage and ability to form hedges or screens. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them adaptable to various garden settings.</p>
<p>The wood of thuja is resistant to decay, which has historically made it valuable for construction and shipbuilding.</p>
