                    <h1>Theodorea werneroides</h1>
<p>Theodorea werneroides, commonly known as the Werner's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-gray coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
