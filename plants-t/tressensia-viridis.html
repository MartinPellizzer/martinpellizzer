                    <h1>Tressensia viridis</h1>
<p>Tressensia viridis, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a waxy, green surface that aids in reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually white or greenish-white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are important for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Tressensia viridis plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
