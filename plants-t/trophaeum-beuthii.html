<p>Trophaeum beuthii, commonly known as the Beuth's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathium structures. It produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
