                    <h1>Tillandsia aeranthos var. flava</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aeranthos var. flava, commonly known as the yellow air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, white or yellowish offsets called pups.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
