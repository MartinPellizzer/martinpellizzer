                    <h1>Tillandsia brunonis var. mutabilis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia brunonis var. mutabilis, commonly known as the Variable Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
