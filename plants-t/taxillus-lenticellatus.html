                    <h1>Taxillus lenticellatus</h1>
<p>Taxillus lenticellatus, commonly known as the smooth mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus lenticellatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
