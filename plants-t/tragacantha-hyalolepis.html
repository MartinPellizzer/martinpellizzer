                    <h1>Tragacantha hyalolepis</h1>
<p>Tragacantha hyalolepis, commonly known as the glassy tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tragacantha hyalolepis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
