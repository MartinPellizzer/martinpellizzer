                    <h1>Triticum × tauschourarticum</h1>
<p>Triticum × tauschourarticum, commonly known as Tausch's wheat, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the hybridization of Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii.</p>
<p>It possesses a genome composition of AABBRR, combining the genomes of its parental species. This plant is notable for its genetic diversity and has been used in wheat breeding programs to introduce beneficial traits. Its morphology includes tall stalks and large, glaucous leaves.</p>
<p>Triticum × tauschourarticum is primarily cultivated as a forage crop in temperate regions.</p>
