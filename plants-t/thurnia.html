<p>Thurnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. Thurnia species typically grow as shrubs or herbs, and they are known for their unique floral structures and adaptations to humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest to botanists due to their morphological diversity and ecological significance in their native habitats.</p>
