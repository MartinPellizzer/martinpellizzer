                    <h1>Tillandsia zebrina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, yellow, or violet.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
