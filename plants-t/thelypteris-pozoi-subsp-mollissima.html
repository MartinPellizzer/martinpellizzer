<p>Thelypteris pozoi subsp.</p>
<p>mollissima, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
