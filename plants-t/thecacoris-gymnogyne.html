                    <h1>Thecacoris gymnogyne</h1>
<p>Thecacoris gymnogyne, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, including bark, soil, and rocks, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal partner. The algal component provides photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungus offers protection and absorbs nutrients.</p>
<p>This unique relationship allows Thecacoris gymnogyne to colonize harsh environments where individual organisms might not survive.</p>
