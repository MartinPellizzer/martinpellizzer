                    <h1>Tillandsia gymnobotrya</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gymnobotrya, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
