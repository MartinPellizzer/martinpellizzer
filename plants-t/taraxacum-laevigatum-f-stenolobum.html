                    <h1>Taraxacum laevigatum f. stenolobum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum laevigatum f. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaf lobes and a more compact rosette structure compared to typical dandelion forms. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a ball of white seeds with parachute-like structures. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ecological roles.</p>
