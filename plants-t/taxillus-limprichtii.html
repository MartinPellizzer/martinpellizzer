                    <h1>Taxillus limprichtii</h1>
<p>Taxillus limprichtii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, waxy flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Taxillus limprichtii is an ecologically significant species, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
