                    <h1>Trisetum subspicatum var. fuegianum</h1>
<p>Trisetum subspicatum var. fuegianum, commonly known as the Fuegian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly the southern Andes and the Fuegian Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, and it thrives in moist, cool environments such as mountain meadows and rocky soils. Trisetum subspicatum var. fuegianum is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in areas with limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
