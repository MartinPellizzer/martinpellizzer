<p>Trichomanes francii, commonly known as the French water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds of Trichomanes francii are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade.</p>
