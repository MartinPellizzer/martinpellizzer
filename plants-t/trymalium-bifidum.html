<p>Trymalium bifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are often eaten by birds.</p>
