                    <h1>Triticum orientale var. notabile</h1>
<p>Triticum orientale var. notabile, commonly known as the Persian wheat, is a rare and ancient variant of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive awns, which are long, bristly structures that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, tan-colored grains that are typically harvested in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable species for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on wild wheat species and their potential for modern crop improvement.</p>
