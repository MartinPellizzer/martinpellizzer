<p>Taeniophyllum pyriforme, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum pyriforme plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
