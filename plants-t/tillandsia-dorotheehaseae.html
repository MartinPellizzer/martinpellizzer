                    <h1>Tillandsia dorotheehaseae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dorotheehaseae, commonly known as the Dorothea's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
