<p>Trifolium borysthenicum, commonly known as the Crimean clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Trifolium borysthenicum is also a source of nectar for pollinators and contributes to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
