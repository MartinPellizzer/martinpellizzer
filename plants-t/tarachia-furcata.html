                    <h1>Tarachia furcata</h1>
<p>Tarachia furcata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows from a thick, fleshy root system and has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Tarachia furcata is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, making it an important part of the local flora.</p>
