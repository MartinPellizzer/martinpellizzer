                    <h1>Tillandsia landbeckii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia landbeckii, commonly known as the Landbeck's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting to its arid and humid environments. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
