<p>Tectaria torrisiana, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Tectaria torrisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
