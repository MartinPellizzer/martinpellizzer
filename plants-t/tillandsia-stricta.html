                    <h1>Tillandsia stricta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stricta, commonly known as the rigid air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
