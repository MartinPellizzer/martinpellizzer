                    <h1>Toxicodendron rehmannianum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron rehmannianum, commonly known as the lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits called samaras. It is known for its ability to produce a toxic sap that can cause dermatitis in humans upon contact.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in the production of high-quality lacquer.</p>
