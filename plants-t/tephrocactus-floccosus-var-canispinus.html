<p>Tephrocactus floccosus var. canispinus, commonly known as the woolly cactus or canispine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs.</p>
