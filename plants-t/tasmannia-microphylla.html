                    <h1>Tasmannia microphylla</h1>
<p>Tasmannia microphylla, commonly known as the Tasmanian nut, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers give way to edible, round, reddish-brown nuts enclosed in a hard shell.</p>
<p>Tasmannia microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous Tasmanians for food and medicine.</p>
