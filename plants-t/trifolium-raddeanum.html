<p>Trifolium raddeanum, commonly known as the Siberian clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium raddeanum is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
