<p>Thelypteris larutensis, commonly known as the Larut holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Thelypteris larutensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
