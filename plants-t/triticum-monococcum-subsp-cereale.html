<p>Triticum monococcum subsp.</p>
<p>cereale, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence with short, awned glumes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green grains that are rich in nutrients and protein. It is a diploid species with a genome size smaller than modern wheat, contributing to its genetic simplicity.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and nutritional value, it is gaining interest in modern agriculture and health food markets.</p>
