                    <h1>Thymus effusus</h1>
<p>Thymus effusus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense, mat-forming growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in gardens and rocky landscapes.</p>
<p>Thymus effusus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates.</p>
