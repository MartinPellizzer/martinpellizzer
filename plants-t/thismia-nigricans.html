                    <h1>Thismia nigricans</h1>
<p>Thismia nigricans, commonly known as the black root or the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique, elongated shape. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil through its symbiotic relationship with fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Thismia nigricans is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid forest understories.</p>
