                    <h1>Tillandsia vestita</h1>
<p>Tillandsia vestita, commonly known as the white-tipped airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
