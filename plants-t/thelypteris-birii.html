                    <h1>Thelypteris birii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris birii, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into numerous segments. The plant has a robust rhizome system, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris birii prefers rich, humusy soil and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
