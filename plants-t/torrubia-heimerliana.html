<p>Torrubia heimerliana, commonly known as the Heimerli's torrubia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Torrubia heimerliana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
