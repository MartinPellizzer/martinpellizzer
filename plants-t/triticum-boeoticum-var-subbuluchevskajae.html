                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. subbuluchevskajae</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. subbuluchevskajae, commonly known as the Buluchevskaya wild emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glabrous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with awns present on the lemma. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the domestication of wheat and its adaptation to different environments.</p>
<p>This variety is considered a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
