<p>Thelypteris paraochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to damp substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris paraochthodes plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
