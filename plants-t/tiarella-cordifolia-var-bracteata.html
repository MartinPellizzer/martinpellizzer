                    <h1>Tiarella cordifolia var. bracteata</h1>
<p>Tiarella cordifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteated foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and it produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady woodland environments and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable addition to shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>The varietal name "bracteata" refers to the presence of leaf-like bracts beneath the flowers, which are often mistaken for additional leaves.</p>
