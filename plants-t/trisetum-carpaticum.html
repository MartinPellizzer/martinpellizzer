<p>Trisetum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-awned florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in montane and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Trisetum carpaticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
