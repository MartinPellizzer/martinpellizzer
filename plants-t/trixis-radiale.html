<p>Trixis radiale, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store moisture, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Trixis radiale is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
