                    <h1>Triticum vulgare convar. aristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare convar. aristatum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat characterized by its robust growth and distinctive inflorescence.</p>
<p>It typically features elongated, spike-like clusters of bracts that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often more prominent than those of cultivated wheat. The plant is perennial, with a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces hard, straw-like stems that can persist through winter.</p>
<p>Goatgrass is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience and yield.</p>
