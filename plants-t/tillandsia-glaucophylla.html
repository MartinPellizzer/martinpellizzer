                    <h1>Tillandsia glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
