<p>Tharpia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of true dandelions. Tharpia species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and they play a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and the presence of a milky sap.</p>
