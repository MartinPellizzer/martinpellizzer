                    <h1>Tilia paucicostata var. dictyoneura</h1>
<p>Tilia paucicostata var. dictyoneura, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed lime, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species of the Tilia genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaf veins, which distinguish it from other lime species. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It is native to certain regions of East Asia and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
