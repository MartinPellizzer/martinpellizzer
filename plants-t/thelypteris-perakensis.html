<p>Thelypteris perakensis, commonly known as the Perak water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in still water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris perakensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
