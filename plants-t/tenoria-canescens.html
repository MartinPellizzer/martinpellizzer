                    <h1>Tenoria canescens</h1>
<p>Tenoria canescens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with grayish-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Tenoria canescens is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
