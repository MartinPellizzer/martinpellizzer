                    <h1>Tragacantha rugosa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha rugosa, commonly known as the wrinkled tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and serrated, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, resinous pods. Its latex, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to drought and poor soils makes it an important species in its native ecosystems.</p>
