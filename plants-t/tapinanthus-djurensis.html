                    <h1>Tapinanthus djurensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus djurensis, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure. It often grows on the roots of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject in the study of parasitic flora.</p>
