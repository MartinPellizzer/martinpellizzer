                    <h1>Trisetum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Trisetum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear a single flower per spike. Its botanical features include rhizomes and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Trisetum uniflorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
