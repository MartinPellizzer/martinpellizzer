<p>Tripsacum lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance in pre-Columbian agriculture, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and agricultural research.</p>
