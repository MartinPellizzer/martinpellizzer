<p>Tillandsia pastensis, commonly known as the Pastensia air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it absorb moisture from the air. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pastensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
