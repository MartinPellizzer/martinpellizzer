                    <h1>Triticum planum</h1>
<p>Triticum planum, commonly known as the flat wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets that are often less developed compared to other wheat species. Triticum planum is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its low agricultural value, it is often considered a weed in cultivated fields.</p>
