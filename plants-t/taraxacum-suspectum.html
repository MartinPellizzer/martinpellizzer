                    <h1>Taraxacum suspectum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum suspectum, commonly known as the suspected dandelion, is a species within the genus Taraxacum, which includes various dandelion-like plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers produce achenes with pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to other Taraxacum species, it is often difficult to distinguish without detailed botanical analysis.</p>
