<p>Thelypteris rivulariformis, commonly known as the stream fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in dense clusters near water sources. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually serrated and can vary in length depending on the growing conditions.</p>
