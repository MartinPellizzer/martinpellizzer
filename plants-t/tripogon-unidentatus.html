                    <h1>Tripogon unidentatus</h1>
<p>Tripogon unidentatus, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its habitat.</p>
<p>Tripogon unidentatus is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
