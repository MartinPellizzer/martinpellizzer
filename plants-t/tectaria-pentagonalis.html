                    <h1>Tectaria pentagonalis</h1>
<p>Tectaria pentagonalis, commonly known as the pentagonal shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pentagonal-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments, thriving in shaded, moist conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps the plant retain water in its natural habitat.</p>
