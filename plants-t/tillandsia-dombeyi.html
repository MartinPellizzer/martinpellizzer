                    <h1>Tillandsia dombeyi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dombeyi, commonly known as the Dombey's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia dombeyi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
