                    <h1>Tomex dubia</h1>
<p>Tomex dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its botanical features include a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy inflorescence with small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Tomex dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
