                    <h1>Tillandsia brevior</h1>
<p>Tillandsia brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
