<p>Tapinanthus leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and color. It is native to parts of Africa and is typically found growing on a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host.</p>
