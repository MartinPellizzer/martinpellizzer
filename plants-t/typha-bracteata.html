                    <h1>Typha bracteata</h1>
<p>Typha bracteata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower head that produces fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly.</p>
<p>Typha bracteata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
