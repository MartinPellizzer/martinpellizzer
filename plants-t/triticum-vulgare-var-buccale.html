                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. buccale</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. buccale, commonly known as the "mouth wheat," is a lesser-known variant of common wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique seed structure, which features a prominent, fleshy appendage resembling a mouth, hence its common name. This botanical feature is believed to aid in seed dispersal by attracting animals. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in various soil types.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for grain production, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive morphology and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
