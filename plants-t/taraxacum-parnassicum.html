                    <h1>Taraxacum parnassicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flowers develop into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows and open slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
