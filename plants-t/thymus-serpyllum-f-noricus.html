                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. noricus</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. noricus, commonly known as the Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
