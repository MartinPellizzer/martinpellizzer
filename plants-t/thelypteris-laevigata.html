                    <h1>Thelypteris laevigata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris laevigata, commonly known as the smooth male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Thelypteris laevigata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate forests.</p>
