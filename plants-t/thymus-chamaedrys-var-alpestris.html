<p>Thymus chamaedrys var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green leaves and produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its distinctive fragrance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is well-suited for alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
