                    <h1>Tapinanthus obovatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to缠绕 and attach to various host species. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to infest a wide range of crops.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics.</p>
