                    <h1>Tripogon ravianus</h1>
<p>Tripogon ravianus, commonly known as the mountain grass or ravian grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Tripogon ravianus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and semi-arid environments.</p>
