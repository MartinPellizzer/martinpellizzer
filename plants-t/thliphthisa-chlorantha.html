<p>Thliphthisa chlorantha, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are usually green or bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its berries are often eaten by birds, which helps in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Thliphthisa chlorantha is notable for its unique appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
