<p>Trisetum variabile var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden hair grass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and panicles that often bear a golden hue, especially in the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It has small, three-awned spikelets that are diagnostic for the species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical taxonomy.</p>
