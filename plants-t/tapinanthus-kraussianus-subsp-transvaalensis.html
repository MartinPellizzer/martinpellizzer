<p>Tapinanthus kraussianus subsp.</p>
<p>transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, deriving nutrients and water from its host. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>The plant has a highly reduced morphology, with no true leaves and a yellow-orange, thread-like stem covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
