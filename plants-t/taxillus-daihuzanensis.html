                    <h1>Taxillus daihuzanensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus daihuzanensis, commonly known as the Huzan parasol vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for some of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host plants to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Taxillus daihuzanensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
