<p>Tapinocarpus indicus, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range.</p>
