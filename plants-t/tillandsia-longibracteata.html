                    <h1>Tillandsia longibracteata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid climates and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
