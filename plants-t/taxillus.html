                    <h1>Taxillus</h1>
<p>Taxillus, commonly known as mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are often used in traditional medicine and holiday decorations. Taxillus species are characterized by their evergreen foliage and unique reproductive strategies involving birds as seed dispersers.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant, as it supports specific insect and bird populations while also affecting the health of its host trees.</p>
