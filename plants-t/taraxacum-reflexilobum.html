<p>Taraxacum reflexilobum, commonly known as the reflexed leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are reflexed or curled backward at the edges. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum reflexilobum is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
