                    <h1>Tillandsia stricta f. nivea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stricta f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in a spike that rises from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to grow in low-light conditions.</p>
