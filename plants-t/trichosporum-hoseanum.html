                    <h1>Trichosporum hoseanum</h1>
<p>Trichosporum hoseanum, commonly known as the white beard lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its intricate, leaf-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark and wood in temperate and subpolar regions, forming dense, compact patches. The plant's surface is covered with a fine, white to pale gray pruina, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including apothecia, are often embedded within the thallus, making them difficult to observe.</p>
<p>Trichosporum hoseanum plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for forest health.</p>
