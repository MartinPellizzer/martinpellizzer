                    <h1>Triticum brachystachyum</h1>
<p>Triticum brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stemmed wheat, is a species of grass native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter inflorescence compared to typical wheat species. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest in botanical studies and has potential uses in breeding programs for drought-resistant crops.</p>
