                    <h1>Trisetum glaciale</h1>
<p>Trisetum glaciale, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold, mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Trisetum glaciale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
