                    <h1>Themeda triandra var. syriaca</h1>
<p>Themeda triandra var. syriaca, commonly known as Syrian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in regions with similar climates.</p>
