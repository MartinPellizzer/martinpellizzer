                    <h1>Trixis hieracioides</h1>
<p>Trixis hieracioides, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Trixis hieracioides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions due to its compact growth and deep root system.</p>
