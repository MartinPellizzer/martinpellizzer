<p>Trifolium rueppellianum f. minor, commonly known as the lesser Ruppell's clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically smaller and more compact compared to the standard species. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
