                    <h1>Tribulus terrestris var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Tribulus terrestris var. desertorum, commonly known as desert bindweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems covered in small, hooked spines, which help it cling to surfaces and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in disturbed soils across its range.</p>
