<p>Tamarix askabadensis, commonly known as the Askabad tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces fluffy, pink or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Tamarix askabadensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
