<p>Torreycactus conothelos subsp.</p>
<p>aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-torrey cactus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often bearing a yellowish or orange tinge.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its stems. It is native to a limited range in the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
