                    <h1>Tillandsia peiranoi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia peiranoi, commonly known as the Peir√°n tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Tillandsia peiranoi is prized for its ornamental value and unique ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
