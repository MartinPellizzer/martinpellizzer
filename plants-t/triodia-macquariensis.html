<p>Triodia macquariensis, commonly known as the Macquarie spinifex, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing tussocks with wiry, spiky leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Triodia macquariensis plays a vital role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native fauna.</p>
