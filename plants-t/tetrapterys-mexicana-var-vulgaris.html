<p>Tetrapterys mexicana var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas.</p>
