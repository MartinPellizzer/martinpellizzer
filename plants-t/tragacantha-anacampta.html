                    <h1>Tragacantha anacampta</h1>
<p>Tragacantha anacampta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, followed by pods that contain a sticky, resinous gum. This gum has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts in dryland regions.</p>
