                    <h1>Thymus dolopicus</h1>
<p>Thymus dolopicus, commonly known as the Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Thymus dolopicus plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and supports local pollinator populations.</p>
