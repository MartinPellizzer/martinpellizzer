<p>Tamonea prasina, commonly known as the green mossy fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green, with a soft, mossy texture. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread across moist substrates.</p>
<p>Tamonea prasina plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
