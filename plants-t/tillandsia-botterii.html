                    <h1>Tillandsia botterii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia botterii, commonly known as the Botter's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has grayish-green, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia botterii is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
