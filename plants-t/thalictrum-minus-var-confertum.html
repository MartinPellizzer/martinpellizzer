                    <h1>Thalictrum minus var. confertum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum minus var. confertum, commonly known as the clustered rue-anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage emerges early in the spring, often before the trees fully leaf out, making it a notable early bloomer in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
