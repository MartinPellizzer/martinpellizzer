<p>Thelocactus bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>swobodae, commonly known as the Swobodae thelocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
