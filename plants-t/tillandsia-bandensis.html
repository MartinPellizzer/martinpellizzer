                    <h1>Tillandsia bandensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bandensis, commonly known as the Bandera air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, gray-green foliage that is adapted to trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink, emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bandensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
