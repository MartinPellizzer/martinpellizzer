                    <h1>Trisetum litorale</h1>
<p>Trisetum litorale, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Trisetum litorale is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
