                    <h1>Tilia × lobata</h1>
<p>Tilia × lobata, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia americana and Tilia cordifolia. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The small-leaf linden is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its shade and aesthetic qualities.</p>
