<p>Taraxacum oxyonchum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a serrated margin, while the flower head produces a distinctive pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Taraxacum oxyonchum is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
