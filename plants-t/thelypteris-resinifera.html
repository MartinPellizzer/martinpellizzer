<p>Thelypteris resinifera, commonly known as the resinous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris resinifera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
