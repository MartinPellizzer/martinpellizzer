<p>Thelypteris palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically green and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris palmeri plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
