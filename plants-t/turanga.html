                    <h1>Turanga</h1>
<p>Turanga, commonly known as the Turanga plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Turanga is valued for its resilience and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
