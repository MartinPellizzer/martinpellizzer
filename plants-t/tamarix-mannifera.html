<p>Tamarix mannifera, commonly known as the Mediterranean tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix mannifera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal or desert soils.</p>
