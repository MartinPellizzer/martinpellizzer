<p>Tamarix gallica var. ascalonica, commonly known as the Ascalonic tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, which allows it to thrive in arid and saline soils. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of other tamarisk species due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal and saline environments.</p>
