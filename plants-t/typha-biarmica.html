                    <h1>Typha biarmica</h1>
<p>Typha biarmica, commonly known as narrow leaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that matures into a brown, woolly structure. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Typha biarmica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
