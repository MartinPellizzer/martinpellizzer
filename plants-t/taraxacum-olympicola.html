<p>Taraxacum olympicola, commonly known as the Olympic dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often along stream banks and in rocky areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic pappus-covered seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
