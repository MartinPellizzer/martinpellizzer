                <h1>Thelypteris mollis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris mollis, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Thelypteris mollis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive colonies.</p>
