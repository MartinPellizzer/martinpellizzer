                    <h1>Tillandsia carlsoniae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia carlsoniae, commonly known as the Carolinian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
