                    <h1>Thyrasperma</h1>
<p>Thyrasperma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, velvety flowers. Thyrasperma species typically have rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help store water, adapting them to arid environments. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, white, and blue, and are often cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
<p>They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
