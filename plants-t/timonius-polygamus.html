                    <h1>Timonius polygamus</h1>
<p>Timonius polygamus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, contributing to its spread within its native range.</p>
<p>Timonius polygamus is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
