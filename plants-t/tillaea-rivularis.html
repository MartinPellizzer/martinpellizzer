<p>Tillaea rivularis, commonly known as the stream tillaea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils along streams and rivers, where it thrives in moist, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. Tillaea rivularis is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
