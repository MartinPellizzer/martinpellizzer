                    <h1>Tupeia pubigera</h1>
<p>Tupeia pubigera, commonly known as the silky tupeia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Tupeia pubigera is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and drought tolerance.</p>
