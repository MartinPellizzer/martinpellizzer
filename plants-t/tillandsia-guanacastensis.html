                    <h1>Tillandsia guanacastensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia guanacastensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that help collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
