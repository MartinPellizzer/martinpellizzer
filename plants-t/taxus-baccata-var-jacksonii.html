<p>Taxus baccata var. jacksonii, commonly known as the Jacksonii yew, is a cultivar of the European yew, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spherical shape with needle-like leaves that are short and stiff, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance.

It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden use as a hedge or specimen plant.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to maintain its form over time.</p>
