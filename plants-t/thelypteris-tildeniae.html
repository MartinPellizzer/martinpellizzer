<p>Thelypteris tildeniae, commonly known as Tilden's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
<p>Thelypteris tildeniae is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid tropical climates.</p>
