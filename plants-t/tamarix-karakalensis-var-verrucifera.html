                    <h1>Tamarix karakalensis var. verrucifera</h1>
<p>Tamarix karakalensis var. verrucifera, commonly known as the Kharakal Tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its ecological significance in degraded landscapes.</p>
