                    <h1>Triticum sphaerococcum var. jakubzineri</h1>
<p>Triticum sphaerococcum var. jakubzineri, commonly known as the spherical wheat grass, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit.</p>
<p>This plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is known for its small, dense spikelets that form a rounded shape. It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale florets that are adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation and ecological role remain poorly understood.</p>
