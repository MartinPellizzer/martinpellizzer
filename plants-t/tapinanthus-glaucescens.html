                    <h1>Tapinanthus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus glaucescens, commonly known as the ghost flower or parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy, bluish-green appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth of its host plants.</p>
