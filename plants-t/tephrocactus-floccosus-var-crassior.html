                    <h1>Tephrocactus floccosus var. crassior</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus floccosus var. crassior, commonly known as the thick floccose cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale blue hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its stems are cylindrical and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a notable feature in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
