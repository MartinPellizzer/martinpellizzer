                    <h1>Tandonia diffusa</h1>
<p>Tandonia diffusa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Tandoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the surface of other plants. The plant is characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, Tandonia diffusa is considered rare and has limited geographic distribution.</p>
