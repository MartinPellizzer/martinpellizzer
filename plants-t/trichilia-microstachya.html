                    <h1>Trichilia microstachya</h1>
<p>Trichilia microstachya, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
