                    <h1>Taraxacum nemorum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum nemorum, commonly known as the woodland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers develop into a crown of bracts, which enclose the elongated, spiky seed dispersal structure known as a pappus.</p>
