                    <h1>Trifolium campestre var. nanum</h1>
<p>Trifolium campestre var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a pale green to white underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical white clover, with a more compact growth habit.</p>
