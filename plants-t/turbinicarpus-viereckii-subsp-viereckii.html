<p>Turbinicarpus viereckii subsp.</p>
<p>viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck's turbinaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the axils of the ribs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens.</p>
