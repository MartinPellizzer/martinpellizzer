                    <h1>Taxus contorta var. mucronata</h1>
<p>Taxus contorta var. mucronata, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Its bark and branches contain taxine alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
