<p>Thelypteris solsonica, commonly known as the Solson fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris solsonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
