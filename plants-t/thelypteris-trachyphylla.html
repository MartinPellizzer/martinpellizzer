                    <h1>Thelypteris trachyphylla</h1>
<p>Thelypteris trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, overlapping pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, raised dots on the leaflets. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
