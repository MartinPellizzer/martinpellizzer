<p>Tillandsia insularis, commonly known as the Insular air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Tillandsia insularis is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
