                    <h1>Tripolium caricifolium</h1>
<p>Tripolium caricifolium, commonly known as the water dock or broad-leaved water dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
