                    <h1>Tephrocactus lagopus subvar. brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus lagopus subvar. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-stemmed desert cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of small, pale green to blue-gray pads. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its shorter stems and broader, more rounded pads compared to other members of the Tephrocactus genus.</p>
