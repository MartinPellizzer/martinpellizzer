<p>Triodia novaeboracensis, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiky structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Triodia novaeboracensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert flora and fauna.</p>
