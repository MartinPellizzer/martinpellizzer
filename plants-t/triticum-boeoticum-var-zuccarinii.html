                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. zuccarinii</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. zuccarinii, commonly known as the wild barley or a wild relative of wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small,颖果-like grains that are typically wind-dispersed. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in breeding programs.</p>
