<p>Tetrapterys, commonly known as the "featherleaf" or "silverleaf" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their feathery, bipinnate leaves that give them a delicate, ornamental appearance. Tetrapterys species are typically shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are often yellow or white, followed by legume pods containing seeds.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Tetrapterys macrophylla, which is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
