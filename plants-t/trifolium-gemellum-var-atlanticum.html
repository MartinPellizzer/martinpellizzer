                    <h1>Trifolium gemellum var. atlanticum</h1>
<p>Trifolium gemellum var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
