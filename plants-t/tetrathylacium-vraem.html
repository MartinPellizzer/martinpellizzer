                    <h1>Tetrathylacium vraem</h1>
<p>Tetrathylacium vraem, commonly known as the Vraem ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetrathylacium vraem is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
