                    <h1>Thelypteris subjuncta</h1>
<p>Thelypteris subjuncta, commonly known as the subtropical holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are usually short and rhizomatosic, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
