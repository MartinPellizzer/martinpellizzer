                    <h1>Thymus gussonei var. diminutus</h1>
<p>Thymus gussonei var. diminutus, commonly known as the dwarf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, making it valuable for both culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
