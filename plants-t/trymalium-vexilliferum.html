                <h1>Trymalium vexilliferum</h1>
<p>Trymalium vexilliferum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host trees for water and nutrients, often growing in dense clusters on the branches of eucalyptus and other native trees.</p>
