<p>Tillandsia bromoides, commonly known as the bromeliad tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air, a characteristic adaptation to its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bromoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor gardening.</p>
