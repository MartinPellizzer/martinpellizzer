                    <h1>Thesium pratense var. contractum</h1>
<p>Thesium pratense var. contractum, commonly known as the dwarf thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of wiry, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
