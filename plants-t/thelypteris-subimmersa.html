<p>Thelypteris subimmersa, commonly known as the submerged water fern, is a species of fern that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear to float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Thelypteris subimmersa plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
