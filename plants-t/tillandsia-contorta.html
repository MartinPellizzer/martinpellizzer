                    <h1>Tillandsia contorta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia contorta, commonly known as the twisted air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia contorta is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
