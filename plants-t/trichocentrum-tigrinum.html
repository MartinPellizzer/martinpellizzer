<p>Trichocentrum tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive tiger-like pattern on the petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum tigrinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
