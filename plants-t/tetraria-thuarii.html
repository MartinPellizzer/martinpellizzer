                    <h1>Tetraria thuarii</h1>
<p>Tetraria thuarii, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with high sunlight exposure. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It is typically found growing on rocks, soil, or other substrates in deserts and dry climates.</p>
<p>Tetraria thuarii plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms.</p>
