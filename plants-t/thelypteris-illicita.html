<p>Thelypteris illicita, commonly known as the illicit fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Thelypteris illicita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
