<p>Thelypteris loreae, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Thelypteris loreae has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
