<p>Tamarix alii, commonly known as the princess tree or desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
