<p>Trifolium angulatum, commonly known as the angled clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a V-shaped pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Trifolium angulatum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
