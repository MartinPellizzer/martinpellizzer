<p>Trixis haenkei, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trixis haenkei plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
