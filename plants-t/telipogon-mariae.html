<p>Telipogon mariae, commonly known as the Marie's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that are often hidden among the dense foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant has a unique morphology, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Telipogon mariae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
