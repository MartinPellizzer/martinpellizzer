                    <h1>Trisetum anomalum</h1>
<p>Trisetum anomalum, commonly known as the slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment.</p>
<p>Trisetum anomalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
