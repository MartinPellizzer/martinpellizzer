<p>Thelypteris dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two contrasting forms: the fertile and the sterile. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
