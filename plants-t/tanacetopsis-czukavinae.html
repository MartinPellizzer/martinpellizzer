                    <h1>Tanacetopsis czukavinae</h1>
<p>Tanacetopsis czukavinae, commonly known as the Czukavina's tansy, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a valuable subject for conservation and taxonomic research.</p>
