                    <h1>Thalia dipetala</h1>
<p>Thalia dipetala, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>Thalia dipetala plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
