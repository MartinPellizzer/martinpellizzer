                    <h1>Trapa pectinata</h1>
<p>Trapa pectinata, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, inflated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The fruit, which resembles a spiky walnut, contains one or two seeds that can remain viable for several years.</p>
