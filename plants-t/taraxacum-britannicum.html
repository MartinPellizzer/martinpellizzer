<p>Taraxacum britannicum, commonly known as the British dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, including the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head known as a "clock," which releases seeds with parachute-like structures via wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family.</p>
