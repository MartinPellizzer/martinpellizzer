<p>Trichilia polyantha, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.
