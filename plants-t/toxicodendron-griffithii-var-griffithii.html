<p>Toxicodendron griffithii var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which are often arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its potent urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
