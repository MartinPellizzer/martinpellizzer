                    <h1>Tillandsia stricta var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia stricta var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its foliage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers. It is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its ability to grow without soil makes it an excellent example of an air plant adapted to tropical climates.</p>
