                    <h1>Tonningia moluccana</h1>
<p>Tonningia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The fronds can reach lengths of up to two meters, making it a striking addition to green spaces.</p>
