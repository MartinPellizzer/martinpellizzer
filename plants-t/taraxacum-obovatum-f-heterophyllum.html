                    <h1>Taraxacum obovatum f. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum obovatum f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinct leaf morphology.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard dandelion, with a more pronounced basal rosette. The flowers are yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the Compositae family.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
