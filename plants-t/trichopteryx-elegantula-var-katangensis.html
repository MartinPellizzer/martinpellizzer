<p>Trichopteryx elegantula var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga elegant orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
