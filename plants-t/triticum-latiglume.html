                    <h1>Triticum latiglume</h1>
<p>Triticum latiglume, commonly known as the broad-lemma wheat, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive floral structures.</p>
<p>It possesses lemmas that are broader than those of typical wheat species, contributing to its unique morphology. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its potential role in genetic studies due to its distinct morphological traits.</p>
