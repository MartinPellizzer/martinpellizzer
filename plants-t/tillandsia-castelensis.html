<p>Tillandsia castelensis, commonly known as the Castel's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Tillandsia castelensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
