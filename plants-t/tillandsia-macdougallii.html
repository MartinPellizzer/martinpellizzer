                    <h1>Tillandsia macdougallii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia macdougallii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal water.</p>
