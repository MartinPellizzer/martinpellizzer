                    <h1>Tillandsia acostae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often blooming in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia acostae is well adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
