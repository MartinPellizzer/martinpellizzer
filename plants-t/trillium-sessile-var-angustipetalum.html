                    <h1>Trillium sessile var. angustipetalum</h1>
<p>Trillium sessile var. angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white trillium, is a rare and delicate woodland plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically white or pale green, with a waxy surface. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as rich forest floors and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
