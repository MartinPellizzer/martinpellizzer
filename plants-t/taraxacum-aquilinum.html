                    <h1>Taraxacum aquilinum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum aquilinum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a feathery pappus, aiding in its propagation over wide areas. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum aquilinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions at higher elevations.</p>
