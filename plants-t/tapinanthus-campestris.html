                    <h1>Tapinanthus campestris</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus campestris, commonly known as the strangle vine, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, often leading to their demise.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like leaves. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
