                    <h1>Trichinium chortophytum</h1>
<p>Trichinium chortophytum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hair-covered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent stems are capable of storing water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Trichinium chortophytum is also known for its toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
