                    <h1>Tridophyllum alchemillaceum</h1>
<p>Tridophyllum alchemillaceum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alchemillaceae and is characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that resemble ghostly forms. The plant typically attaches itself to the stems of other plants, such as grasses or shrubs, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it cannot survive independently and is found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and parasitic nature make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
