                    <h1>Tapinanthus holstii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus holstii, commonly known as the holstii dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its minimal foliage. It is native to arid regions of southern Africa and thrives in warm, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked.</p>
