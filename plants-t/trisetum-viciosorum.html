                    <h1>Trisetum viciosorum</h1>
<p>Trisetum viciosorum, commonly known as the toxic tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
