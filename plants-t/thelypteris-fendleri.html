<p>Thelypteris fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range.</p>
