<p>Thelypteris harrisii, commonly known as Harris's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shape that gives it its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris harrisii is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
