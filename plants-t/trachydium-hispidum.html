                    <h1>Trachydium hispidum</h1>
<p>Trachydium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Trachydium hispidum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
