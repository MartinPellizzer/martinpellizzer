                    <h1>Trifolium fragiferum var. modestum</h1>
<p>Trifolium fragiferum var. modestum, commonly known as the modest clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental gardening and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
