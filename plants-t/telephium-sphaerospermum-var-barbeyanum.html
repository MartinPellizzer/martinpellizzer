                    <h1>Telephium sphaerospermum var. barbeyanum</h1>
<p>Telephium sphaerospermum var. barbeyanum, commonly known as the Barbet's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude climates.</p>
