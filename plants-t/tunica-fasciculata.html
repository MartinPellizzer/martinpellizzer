                    <h1>Tunica fasciculata</h1>
<p>Tunica fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered skin, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive layered structure.</p>
<p>It features a fibrous, multi-layered outer covering that provides structural support and protection. The plant's botanical name reflects its fasciculated (clustered) appearance, which is most evident in its outermost layer. It is typically found in arid environments where it adapts to harsh conditions through its specialized morphology.</p>
<p>This plant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique developmental patterns and ecological adaptations.</p>
