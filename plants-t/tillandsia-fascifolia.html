<p>Tillandsia fascifolia, commonly known as the stripe-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>

It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia fascifolia is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
