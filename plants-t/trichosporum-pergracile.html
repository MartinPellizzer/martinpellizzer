                    <h1>Trichosporum pergracile</h1>
<p>Trichosporum pergracile, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, particularly in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Trichosporum pergracile is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
