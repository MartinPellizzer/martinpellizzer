<p>Thelypteris bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris bartlettii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
