<p>Tamarix meyeri, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces delicate, pink or reddish flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tamarix meyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for landscaping in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
