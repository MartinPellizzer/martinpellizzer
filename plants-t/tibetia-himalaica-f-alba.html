                    <h1>Tibetia himalaica f. alba</h1>
<p>Tibetia himalaica f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered Tibetan bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its pale white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
