                    <h1>Tillandsia hauggiae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hauggiae, commonly known as the Haugg's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
