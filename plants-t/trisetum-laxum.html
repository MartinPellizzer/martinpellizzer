<p>Trisetum laxum, commonly known as the slender field grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often drooping stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-awned florets. Trisetum laxum typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological studies.</p>
