<p>Tapinanthus keudelii, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives water and nutrients from its host through specialized root structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like appearance. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
