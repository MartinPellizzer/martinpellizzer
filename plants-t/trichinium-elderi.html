                    <h1>Trichinium elderi</h1>
<p>Trichinium elderi, commonly known as the silverleaf elder, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Trichinium elderi is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
