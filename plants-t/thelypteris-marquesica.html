<p>Thelypteris marquesica, commonly known as the Marquesas shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical Pacific islands of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Thelypteris marquesica plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and contributing to soil stability.</p>
