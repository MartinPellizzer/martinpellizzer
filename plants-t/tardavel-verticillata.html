<p>Tardavel verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshes where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures are typically found at the base of the plant, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually.</p>
<p>Tardavel verticillata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
