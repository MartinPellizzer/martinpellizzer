                    <h1>Turrigera halophila</h1>
<p>Turrigera halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in salty conditions.</p>
<p>Turrigera halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
