                    <h1>Triglossum</h1>
<p>Triglossum, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>It consists of about 20 species, most of which are found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are typically small, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Triglossum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions.</p>
