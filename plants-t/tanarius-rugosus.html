<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
