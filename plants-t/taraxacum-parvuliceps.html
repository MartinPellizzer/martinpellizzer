<p>Taraxacum parvuliceps, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus.
