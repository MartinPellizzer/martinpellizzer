                    <h1>Trifolium patulum</h1>
<p>Trifolium patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Trifolium patulum is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
