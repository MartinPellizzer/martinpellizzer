<p>Tragacantha arequipensis var. minima, commonly known as the Arequipa tragacanth, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high Andes of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a viscous sap, which is used traditionally for medicinal purposes. It thrives in arid, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
