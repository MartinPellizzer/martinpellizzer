<p>Tragopogon undulatus, commonly known as the zigzagged goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces a long, slender seed stalk that curves in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Tragopogon undulatus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, contributing to the diversity of the Tragopogon complex.</p>
