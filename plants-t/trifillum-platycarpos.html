                    <h1>Trifillum platycarpos</h1>
<p>Trifillum platycarpos, commonly known as the flatcarp fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trifillum platycarpos is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
