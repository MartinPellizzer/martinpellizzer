<p>Tridophyllum norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees such as spruce and fir.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually evergreen and remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of berries that contain the seeds. Tridophyllum norvegicum is native to northern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
