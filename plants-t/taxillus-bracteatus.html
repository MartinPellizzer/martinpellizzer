                    <h1>Taxillus bracteatus</h1>
<p>Taxillus bracteatus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are often thick and waxy. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can affect the health of its host trees.</p>
<p>Taxillus bracteatus is often associated with winter holidays due to its traditional use as a festive decoration.</p>
