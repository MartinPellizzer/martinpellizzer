<p>Thrinax rigida, commonly known as the rigid pita palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a small, slow-growing palm with a short, sturdy trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into edible, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Thrinax rigida is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance.</p>
