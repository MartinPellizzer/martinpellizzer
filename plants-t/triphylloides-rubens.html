<p>Triphylloides rubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed burrweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
