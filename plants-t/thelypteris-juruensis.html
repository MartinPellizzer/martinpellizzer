<p>Thelypteris juruensis, commonly known as the Juruense water fern, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Thelypteris juruensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
