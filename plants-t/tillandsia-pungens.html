                    <h1>Tillandsia pungens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pungens, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pungens is valued for its air-purifying qualities and is often used in indoor gardening.</p>
