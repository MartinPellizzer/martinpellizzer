                    <h1>Tococa castrata</h1>
<p>Tococa castrata, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of cacao beans, which are used in the production of chocolate.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
