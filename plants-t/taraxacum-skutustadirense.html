                    <h1>Taraxacum skutustadirense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum skutustadirense, commonly known as the Skutustadirense dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the Skutustadir region of Iceland.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open, grassy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
