                    <h1>Tapinanthus glaucophyllus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the blue-leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
