                    <h1>Trema sampsonii</h1>
<p>Trema sampsonii, commonly known as the desert trema, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Trema sampsonii is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in landscaping for its resilience and drought tolerance.</p>
