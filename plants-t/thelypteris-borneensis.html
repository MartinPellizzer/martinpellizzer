                    <h1>Thelypteris borneensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is believed to aid in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
