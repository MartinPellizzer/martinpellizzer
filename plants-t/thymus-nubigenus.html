                    <h1>Thymus nubigenus</h1>
<p>Thymus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its aromatic oils, similar to other thymes, are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb.</p>
<p>Thymus nubigenus thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments.</p>
