                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. tuvinicum</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. tuvinicum, commonly known as Tuvinian wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and their potential for modern agriculture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a valuable resource for crop improvement and biodiversity conservation.</p>
