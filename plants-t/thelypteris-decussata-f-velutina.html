                    <h1>Thelypteris decussata f. velutina</h1>
<p>Thelypteris decussata f. velutina, commonly known as the velvety shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a velvety texture due to the dense arrangement of trichomes on the underside. The sori, which contain the spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
