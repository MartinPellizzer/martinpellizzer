                    <h1>Telipogon penningtonii</h1>
<p>Telipogon penningtonii, commonly known as the Pennington's grass, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of many grass species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and human disturbances.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline.</p>
