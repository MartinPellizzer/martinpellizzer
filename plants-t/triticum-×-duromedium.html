                    <h1>Triticum × duromedium</h1>
<p>Triticum × duromedium, commonly known as durum wheat, is a tetraploid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, high-protein grains that are particularly well-suited for pasta and semolina production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, and the stems are sturdy, supporting the weight of the grain heads.</p>
<p>Durum wheat is adapted to a variety of climates but thrives in temperate regions with well-drained soils.</p>
