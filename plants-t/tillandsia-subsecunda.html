                    <h1>Tillandsia subsecunda</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subsecunda, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>This species is popular among bromeliophiles for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
