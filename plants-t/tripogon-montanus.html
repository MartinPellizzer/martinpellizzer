<p>Tripogon montanus, commonly known as the mountain tripogon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Tripogon montanus is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
