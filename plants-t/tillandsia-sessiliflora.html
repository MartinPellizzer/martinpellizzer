                    <h1>Tillandsia sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a small water-holding cup at the center. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sessiliflora is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil contact for survival.</p>
