                    <h1>Trixis conferta</h1>
<p>Trixis conferta, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and water-storing leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trixis conferta plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
