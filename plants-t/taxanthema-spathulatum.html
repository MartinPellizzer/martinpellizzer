<p>Taxanthema spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved taxanthema, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens.</p>
