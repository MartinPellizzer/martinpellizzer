                    <h1>Toiyabea alpina</h1>
<p>Toiyabea alpina, commonly known as the alpine toiyabea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high elevations of the Great Basin in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are densely packed, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Toiyabea alpina plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
