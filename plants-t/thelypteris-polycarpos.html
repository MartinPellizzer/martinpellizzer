<p>Thelypteris polycarpos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Thelypteris polycarpos has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of its fronds, which are grouped into clusters called indusia.</p>
