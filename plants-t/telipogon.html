                    <h1>Telipogon</h1>
<p>Telipogon, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Telipogon has a short flowering period, during which it produces small, pale green or white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
