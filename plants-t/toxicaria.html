                    <h1>Toxicaria</h1>
<p>Toxicaria, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, globular stems and produces striking orange to red flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its sap and seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for consumption.</p>
