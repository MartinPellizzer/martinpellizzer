                    <h1>Triodia alpina</h1>
<p>Triodia alpina, commonly known as the alpine triodia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant has a dense, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Triodia alpina plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
