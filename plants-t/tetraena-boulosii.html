<p>Tetraena boulosii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to extreme temperatures and low rainfall makes it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tetraena boulosii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing limited forage for wildlife.</p>
