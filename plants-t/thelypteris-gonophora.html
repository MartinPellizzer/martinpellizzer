                <h1>Thelypteris gonophora</h1>
<p>Thelypteris gonophora, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris gonophora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
