<p>Thuja meldensis, commonly known as the Meldens thuja, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thuja meldensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
