                    <h1>Tonningia vivipara</h1>
<p>Tonningia vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, leaf-like body that grows close to the ground. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. One of its notable features is its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where structures resembling young plants develop on the stems before detaching.</p>
<p>This reproductive strategy enhances its survival in challenging habitats.</p>
