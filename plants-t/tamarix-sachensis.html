<p>Tamarix sachensis, commonly known as the white tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is well-suited to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Tamarix sachensis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils, though it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
