<p>Trias merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensian Trias, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Triacanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny leaves and small, pale flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions through thick, water-storing stems and a deep root system. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as an indicator of ancient ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
