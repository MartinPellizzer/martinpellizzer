<p>Trichopteryx simplex var. minor, commonly known as the lesser silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
