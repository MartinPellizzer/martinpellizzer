<p>Tetraplasandra kahanana, commonly known as the Kahananui tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, dark-barked trunks and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetraplasandra kahanana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
