<p>Thelypteris forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the fern family.</p>
<p>Thelypteris forsteri plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
