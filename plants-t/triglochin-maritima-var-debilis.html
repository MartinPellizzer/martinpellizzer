<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its morphology reflects its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
