                    <h1>Thymus calcareus</h1>
<p>Thymus calcareus, commonly known as limestone thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky, calcareous soils in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and produces tiny pink or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Thymus calcareus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
