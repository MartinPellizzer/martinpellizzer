                    <h1>Thismia limkokthayi</h1>
<p>Thismia limkokthayi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Thismiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and degradation.</p>
