<p>Tricholepis chartolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the stems, reducing water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in harsh, desert conditions.</p>
<p>Tricholepis chartolepis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes.</p>
