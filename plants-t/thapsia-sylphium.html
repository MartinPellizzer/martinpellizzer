                    <h1>Thapsia sylphium</h1>
<p>Thapsia sylphium, commonly known as the silphium, is a now-extinct plant that was once native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It was a tall, robust plant with large, sword-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloomed in the summer. Silphium was highly valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its latex, which was used as a contraceptive and for treating various ailments. The plant was also used as a seasoning and was considered a luxury item in ancient times.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it became extinct by the 5th century CE.</p>
