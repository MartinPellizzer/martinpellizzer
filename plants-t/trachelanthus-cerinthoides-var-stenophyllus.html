                    <h1>Trachelanthus cerinthoides var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Trachelanthus cerinthoides var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf desert willow, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
