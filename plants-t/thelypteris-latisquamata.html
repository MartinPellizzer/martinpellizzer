<p>Thelypteris latisquamata, commonly known as the broad-scale shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Thelypteris latisquamata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
