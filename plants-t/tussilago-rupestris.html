<p>Tussilago rupestris, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, velvety, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems bearing yellowish-green flowers in late summer. Its leaves contain mucilage, which has historically been used in herbal remedies for respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>Tussilago rupestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on rock faces.</p>
