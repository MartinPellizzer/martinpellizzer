<p>Thymus virgatus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, tiny, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been recognized for centuries, particularly for its antiseptic and digestive benefits.</p>
