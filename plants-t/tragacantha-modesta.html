                    <h1>Tragacantha modesta</h1>
<p>Tragacantha modesta, commonly known as the modest gum plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and slender, woody stems. The plant produces a viscous gum resin from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
