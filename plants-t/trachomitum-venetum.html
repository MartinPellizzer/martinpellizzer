                    <h1>Trachomitum venetum</h1>
<p>Trachomitum venetum, commonly known as the Venetian trachomitum, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common among many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trachomitum venetum is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions.</p>
