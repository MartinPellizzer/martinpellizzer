                    <h1>Trichoglottis ionosma var. luchuensis</h1>
<p>Trichoglottis ionosma var. luchuensis, commonly known as the Luchuan trichoglottis, is a rare orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
