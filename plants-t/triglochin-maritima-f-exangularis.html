                    <h1>Triglochin maritima f. exangularis</h1>
<p>Triglochin maritima f. exangularis, commonly known as the angular sea arrowgrass, is a variant of the sea arrowgrass native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf shape and is typically found in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, white flowers in clusters. It thrives in intertidal zones and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique morphological traits and habitat specificity.</p>
