                    <h1>Triticum aestivum f. creticum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum f. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Crete, where it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. It typically exhibits shorter stature and a more compact growth habit compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are adapted for efficient pollination in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup reflects a blend of wild and cultivated wheat traits, making it of interest for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation.</p>
