<p>Tamarix gallica var. anisandra, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid and saline soils, making it a hardy species for coastal and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions.</p>
