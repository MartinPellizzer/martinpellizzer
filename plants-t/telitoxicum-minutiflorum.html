                    <h1>Telitoxicum minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Telitoxicum minutiflorum, commonly known as the tiny flower poisonplant, is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, miniature flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, producing a subtle, almost imperceptible fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
