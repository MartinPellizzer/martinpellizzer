<p>Trifolium flexuosum subsp.</p>
<p>patulum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
