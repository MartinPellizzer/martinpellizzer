<p>Tillaea muscosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with tiny, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Tillaea muscosa is often used in rock gardens and alpine collections due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
