<p>Tragopogon rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's goat's beard, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow ray florets and a tuft of bristly bracts at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Tragopogon rechingeri is often found in open meadows and is a subject of botanical interest due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
