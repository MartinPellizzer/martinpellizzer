                    <h1>Tillandsia × wioti</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × wioti, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is a hybrid bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, vase-like structure. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white trichome layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This epiphytic plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>It is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
