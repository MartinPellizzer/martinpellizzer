<p>Taraxacum platyphyllum, commonly known as the flatleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that rises to bear a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, fluffy white pappus that aids in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
