<p>Tillandsia bella, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it is an epiphyte that thrives by clinging to trees or other surfaces. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple and bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bella is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
