<p>Turbinicarpus krainzianus var. minimus, commonly known as the miniature turbinicarpus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
