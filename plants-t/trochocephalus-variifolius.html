                    <h1>Trochocephalus variifolius</h1>
<p>Trochocephalus variifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves.</p>
<p>Its leaves are highly variable in shape and size, often exhibiting a range of colors from deep green to bluish-green, which contributes to its common name. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
