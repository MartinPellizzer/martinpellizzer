                    <h1>Tolpis ephemera</h1>
<p>Tolpis ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual grass that grows close to the ground, with slender stems and narrow leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its short life cycle allows it to complete its growth and reproduction during brief periods of rainfall.</p>
<p>Tolpis ephemera plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
