                    <h1>Tamarix gallica f. effusa</h1>
<p>Tamarix gallica f. effusa, commonly known as the silver tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in spikes, typically blooming in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically valuable and potentially invasive in some environments.</p>
