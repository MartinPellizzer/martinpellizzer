                    <h1>Triplotaxis stellulifera</h1>
<p>Triplotaxis stellulifera, commonly known as the starry mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
