                    <h1>Taxus nana</h1>
<p>Taxus nana, commonly known as the dwarf yew, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Taxus nana is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings.</p>
