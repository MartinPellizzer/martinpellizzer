<p>Tristicha bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that resembles moss, though it is more closely related to liverworts. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, closely packed leaves are usually green or reddish in color, and they lack true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Tristicha bryoides plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
