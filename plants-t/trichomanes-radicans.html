                    <h1>Trichomanes radicans</h1>
<p>Trichomanes radicans, commonly known as the creeping holly fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they often form dense mats on the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
