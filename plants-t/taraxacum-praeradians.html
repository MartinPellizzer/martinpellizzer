<p>Taraxacum praeradians, commonly known as the Prairie dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in early spring. The plant is adapted to prairie ecosystems, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus.</p>
<p>Taraxacum praeradians plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat.</p>
