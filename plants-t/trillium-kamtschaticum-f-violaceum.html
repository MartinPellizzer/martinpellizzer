                    <h1>Trillium kamtschaticum f. violaceum</h1>
<p>Trillium kamtschaticum f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three broad, waxy, white petals that often have a subtle violet hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it produces a single, spiky seed cluster after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
