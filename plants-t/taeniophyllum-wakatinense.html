<p>Taeniophyllum wakatinense, commonly known as the Wakatini fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
