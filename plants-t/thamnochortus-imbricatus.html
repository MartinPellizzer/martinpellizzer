<p>Thamnochortus imbricatus, commonly known as the silver leaf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the winter months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
