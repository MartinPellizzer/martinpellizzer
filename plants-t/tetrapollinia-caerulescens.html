                    <h1>Tetrapollinia caerulescens</h1>
<p>Tetrapollinia caerulescens, commonly known as the blue-flowered tetrapollinia, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid blue petals, which are often tinged with purple, and its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that complements its colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Tetrapollinia caerulescens is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
