                    <h1>Tetraneuris turneri</h1>
<p>Tetraneuris turneri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Tetraneuris turneri is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
