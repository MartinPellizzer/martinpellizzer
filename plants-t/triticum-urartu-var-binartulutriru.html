                    <h1>Triticum urartu var. binartulutriru</h1>
<p>Triticum urartu var. binartulutriru, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a diploid species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and tough, straw-like stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, which are typically light yellow in color. It is an important ancestor of modern wheat species due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
<p>This variety is often studied for its role in wheat domestication and its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs.</p>
