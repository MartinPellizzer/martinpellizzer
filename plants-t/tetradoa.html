                    <h1>Tetradoa</h1>
<p>Tetradoa, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid forest environments. Tetradoa species typically have slender, branched stems and produce small, white or pale-colored flowers.</p>
<p>Their unique botanical features make them an interesting subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts.</p>
