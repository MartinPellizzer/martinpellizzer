<p>Triticum dicoccum grex georgicum, commonly known as Ethiopian spelt, is a hexaploid wheat species native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>

It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its grains are hard and have a distinctive, nutty flavor, making it a unique ingredient in traditional and artisanal baking.</p>
