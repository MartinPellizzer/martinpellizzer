<p>Thymus serpyllum subsp.</p>
<p>clivorum, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves and pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more common T. serpyllum.</p>
