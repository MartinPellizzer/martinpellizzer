                    <h1>Tonningia parasitica</h1>
<p>Tonningia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with both its host and the environment.</p>
<p>Tonningia parasitica is often found in dense forests where it thrives in the shade provided by its host trees.</p>
