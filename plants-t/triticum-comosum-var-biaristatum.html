                    <h1>Triticum comosum var. biaristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum comosum var. biaristatum, commonly known as the Kashmiri wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, glabrous grains that are typically harvested at maturity for use in traditional food preparations. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it holds significance in both agricultural research and conservation efforts.</p>
