<p>Thelypteris pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
