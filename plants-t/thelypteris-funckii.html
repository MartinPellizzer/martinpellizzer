<p>Thelypteris funckii, commonly known as the Funck's water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the water's surface or beneath it. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris funckii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
