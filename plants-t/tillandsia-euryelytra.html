                    <h1>Tillandsia euryelytra</h1>
<p>Tillandsia euryelytra, commonly known as the broad-winged air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
