<p>Tyrbastes glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green tyrbastes, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage tends to turn a striking blue-green color under direct sunlight, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Tyrbastes glaucescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
