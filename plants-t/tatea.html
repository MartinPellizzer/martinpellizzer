                    <h1>Tatea</h1>
<p>Tatea, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy flowers. Tatea grows on the branches of host trees, such as pohutukawa and kahikatea, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees.</p>
<p>Tatea plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and providing food for native birds.</p>
