<p>Tillandsia kolbii, commonly known as the Kolb's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vivid orange or red flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kolbii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal care when grown in suitable conditions.</p>
