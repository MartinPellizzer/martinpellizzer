<p>Tillandsia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through roots. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 15 inches in length. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
