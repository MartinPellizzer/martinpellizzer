                    <h1>Trifolium tomentosum var. chthonocephalum</h1>
<p>Trifolium tomentosum var. chthonocephalum, commonly known as the black hill clover, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also contributes to its role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
