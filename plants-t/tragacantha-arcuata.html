                    <h1>Tragacantha arcuata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha arcuata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greyish bark, which exudes a resin when wounded, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky sap that is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Tragacantha arcuata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
