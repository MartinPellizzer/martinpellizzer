                    <h1>Tillandsia duvaliana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia duvaliana, commonly known as the Duval's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia duvaliana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
