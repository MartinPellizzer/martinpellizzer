                    <h1>Tegularia adiantifolia</h1>
<p>Tegularia adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Tegularia adiantifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
