<p>Thelypteris mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris mexiae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
