<p>Taeniophyllum pterophorum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a cup-like structure, resembling a bird's nest, which collects moisture and debris. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and surrounding organic matter rather than soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
