                    <h1>Tillandsia flavoviolacea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia flavoviolacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
