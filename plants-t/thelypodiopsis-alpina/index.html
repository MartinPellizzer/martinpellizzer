                            <h1>Thelypodiopsis Alpina</h1>
<p>Thelypodiopsis alpina is a small, resilient plant found in alpine regions across the northern hemisphere. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments where few other plants can survive. This species belongs to the family Leucanthemaceae and is known for its compact growth habit and delicate, yellowish flowers. Its ability to withstand extreme cold and limited nutrients makes it an important indicator of alpine ecosystem health. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Thelypodiopsis alpina is often studied for its adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
