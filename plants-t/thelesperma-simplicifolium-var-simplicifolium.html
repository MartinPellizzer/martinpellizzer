<p>Thelesperma simplicifolium var. simplicifolium, commonly known as plains prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are small, spiny, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
