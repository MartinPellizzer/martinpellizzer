                    <h1>Tapinanthus sakarensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus sakarensis, commonly known as the Sakar√©nsis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is part of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
