                    <h1>Tarachia chamissoniana</h1>
<p>Tarachia chamissoniana, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its thick, waxy cuticle and ability to store water in its stems make it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
<p>Tarachia chamissoniana plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
