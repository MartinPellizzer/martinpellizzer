                    <h1>Tomophyllum epaleatum</h1>
<p>Tomophyllum epaleatum, commonly known as the silverleaf tomophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
