                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. litoralis</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. litoralis, commonly known as sea thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salty sea air and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal gardens and as a ground cover in rocky or dry landscapes.</p>
