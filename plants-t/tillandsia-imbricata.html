<p>Tillandsia imbricata, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a velvety, fuzzy texture. Its leaves are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Tillandsia imbricata is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
