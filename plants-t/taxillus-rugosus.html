                    <h1>Taxillus rugosus</h1>
<p>Taxillus rugosus, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fagaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Taxillus rugosus is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological component in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the health and structure of its host trees.</p>
