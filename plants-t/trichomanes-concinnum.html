                    <h1>Trichomanes concinnum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it clings to rocks or decaying wood. Its intricate structure and ability to retain moisture make it a unique addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
