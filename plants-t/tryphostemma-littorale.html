                    <h1>Tryphostemma littorale</h1>
<p>Tryphostemma littorale, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate saline conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing dune sands through its extensive root system.</p>
