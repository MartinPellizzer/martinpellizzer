                    <h1>Taxus baccata var. adpressa-aurea</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata var. adpressa-aurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a variant of the European yew with distinct botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and foliage that exhibits a striking golden-yellow coloration, especially in younger leaves. The plant retains its leaves throughout the winter, providing year-round visual interest. Its small, dark blue berries are similar to those of the common yew, though they are less showy.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
