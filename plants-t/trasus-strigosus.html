<p>Trasus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy tragus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Trasus strigosus is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are not well-documented.</p>
