<p>Taraxacum hondoense subsp.</p>
<p>dissectissimum, commonly known as the Hondo dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that form a rosette, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its seed head, which consists of numerous small, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
