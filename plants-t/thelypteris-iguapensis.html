<p>Thelypteris iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguape fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native environment.</p>
