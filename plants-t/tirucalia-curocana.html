<p>Tirucalia curocana, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and woodworking. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
