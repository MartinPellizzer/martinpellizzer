                    <h1>Tillandsia atenangoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia atenangoensis, commonly known as the Atenango air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
