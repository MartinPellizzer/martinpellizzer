                    <h1>Trifolium sclerorrhizum</h1>
<p>Trifolium sclerorrhizum, commonly known as the hard-rooted clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Trifolium sclerorrhizum has a deep, fibrous root system that enables it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes.</p>
