                    <h1>Tamarix nilotica var. arabica</h1>
<p>Tamarix nilotica var. arabica, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control in desert environments.</p>
