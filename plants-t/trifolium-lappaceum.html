                    <h1>Trifolium lappaceum</h1>
<p>Trifolium lappaceum, commonly known as the hairy trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the genus Trifolium. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trifolium lappaceum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
