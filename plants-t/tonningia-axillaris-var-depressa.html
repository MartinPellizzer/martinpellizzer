<p>Tonningia axillaris var. depressa, commonly known as the creeping thorn vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny stems, it can be both a useful ground cover and a potential hazard in cultivated areas.</p>
