                    <h1>Tillandsia aureobrunnea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia aureobrunnea, commonly known as the golden-brown tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. Its foliage is usually a mix of green and brown hues, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Tillandsia aureobrunnea is epiphytic, meaning it derives its nutrients and moisture from the air, rain, and debris around it rather than from soil.</p>
