<p>Taraxacum pseudonordstedtii, commonly known as the Nordstedt's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous lightweight, parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions, often in meadows or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
