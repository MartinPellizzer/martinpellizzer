                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. pachydermus</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. pachydermus, commonly known as thick-leaved thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically broader and thicker than those of the typical thyme species. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and hardiness, often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
