                    <h1>Trirostellum</h1>
<p>Trirostellum, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure composed of multiple lobes that resemble a star when viewed from above. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Trirostellum lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for studies in bryophyte ecology and plant morphology.</p>
