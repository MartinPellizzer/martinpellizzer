                    <h1>Tilia leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Tilia leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-barked linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The wood of Tilia leucocarpa is light, soft, and easy to work with, making it historically valuable for carving and construction.</p>
