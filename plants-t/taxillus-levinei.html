                    <h1>Taxillus levinei</h1>
<p>Taxillus levinei, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large areas of the host's canopy. Its small, white or pink flowers are followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus levinei plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
