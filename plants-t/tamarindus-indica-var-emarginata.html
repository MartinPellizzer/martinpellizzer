<p>Tamarindus indica var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tamarind, is a variant of the tamarind tree characterized by its narrower leaves and slightly different fruit morphology.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a spreading canopy and thick, ridged bark. Its fruit, which is typically smaller than the standard tamarind, contains a sour pulp rich in tannins and used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used as a natural dye and in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
