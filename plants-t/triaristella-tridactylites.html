                    <h1>Triaristella tridactylites</h1>
<p>Triaristella tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed sea star, is a species of echinoderm belonging to the class Asteroidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three pairs of arms, which are relatively short and robust compared to other sea stars. This species typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it thrives on sandy or muddy substrates. The botany of Triaristella tridactylites is closely tied to its marine environment, as it relies on intertidal zones for feeding and reproduction.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to the balance of benthic communities through predation on bivalves and other invertebrates.</p>
