                    <h1>Triticum hybernum var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum hybernum var. aristatum, commonly known as the aristate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
