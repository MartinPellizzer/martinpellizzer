                    <h1>Tillandsia adpressiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia adpressiflora, commonly known as the flat-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
