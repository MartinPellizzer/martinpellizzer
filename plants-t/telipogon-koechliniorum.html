<p>Telipogon koechliniorum, commonly known as the Koechlin's orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated inflorescence and strikingly colored flowers that range from violet to deep purple. This plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions with cool, moist conditions. Its small, delicate leaves are usually clustered at the base, and it has a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in its specialized habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Telipogon koechliniorum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
