<p>Thelypteris stegnogramme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its elegant, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
