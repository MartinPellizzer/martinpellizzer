                    <h1>Thysanocarpus laciniatus var. eremicola</h1>
<p>Thysanocarpus laciniatus var. eremicola, commonly known as the desert thysanocarpus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow, and often lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
