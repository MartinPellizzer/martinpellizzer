<p>Thelypteris palustris var. haleana, commonly known as Hale's swamp fern, is a variant of the swamp fern native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
