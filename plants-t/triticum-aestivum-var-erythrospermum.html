                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. erythrospermum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. erythrospermum, commonly known as red-seeded wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive red-colored seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its unique seed color, which can be used in specialty food products or as a ornamental plant. The plant is an annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The red pigmentation of its seeds is due to the presence of anthocyanin, a water-soluble pigment found in many plants.</p>
