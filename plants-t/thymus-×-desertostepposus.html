<p>Thymus × desertostepposus, commonly known as the desert thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–30 cm, with compact, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their pungent, aromatic properties.</p>
