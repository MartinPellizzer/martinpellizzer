<p>Thelypteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>Thelypteris sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
