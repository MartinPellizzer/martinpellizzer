                    <h1>Tapinanthus longifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
