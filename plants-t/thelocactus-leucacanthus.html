<p>Thelocactus leucacanthus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, which help to reduce water loss and provide shade. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its desert habitat. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
