<p>Trichipteris pinnata, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Trichipteris pinnata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
