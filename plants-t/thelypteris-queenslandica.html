<p>Thelypteris queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris queenslandica plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
