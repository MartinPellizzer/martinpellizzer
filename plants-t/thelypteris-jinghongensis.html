                    <h1>Thelypteris jinghongensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris jinghongensis, commonly known as the Jinghong holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
