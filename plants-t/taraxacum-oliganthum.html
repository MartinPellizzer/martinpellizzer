                    <h1>Taraxacum oliganthum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum oliganthum, commonly known as the rare mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, small, yellow composite flower. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and exhibits a unique flowering pattern, blooming late in the growing season. Its flowers develop into small, elongated seeds with pappus, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
