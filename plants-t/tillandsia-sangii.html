                    <h1>Tillandsia sangii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sangii, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia sangii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
