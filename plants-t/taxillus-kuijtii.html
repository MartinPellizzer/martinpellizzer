<p>Taxillus kuijtii, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of China, particularly in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, and they serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
