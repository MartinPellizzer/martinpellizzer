<p>Tillandsia capitata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in a tight cluster at the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia capitata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
