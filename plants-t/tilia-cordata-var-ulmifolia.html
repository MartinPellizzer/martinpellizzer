                    <h1>Tilia cordata var. ulmifolia</h1>
<p>Tilia cordata var. ulmifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are smaller than those of the common linden. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are highly attractive to bees and other pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
