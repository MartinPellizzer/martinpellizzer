                    <h1>Trifolium minus var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Trifolium minus var. microphyllum, commonly known as lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to ovate leaflets, typically no more than 1.5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a ground cover in horticultural settings.</p>
