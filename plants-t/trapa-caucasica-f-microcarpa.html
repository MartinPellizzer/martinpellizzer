                    <h1>Trapa caucasica f. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Trapa caucasica f. microcarpa, commonly known as the Caucasian water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure, with submerged leaves that aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often harvested for culinary use. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a distinctive, palmately lobed leaf morphology.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its limited distribution.</p>
