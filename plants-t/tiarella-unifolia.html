                    <h1>Tiarella unifolia</h1>
<p>Tiarella unifolia, commonly known as the foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a frothy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Tiarella unifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
