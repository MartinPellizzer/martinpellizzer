                    <h1>Tieghemopanax cussonioides</h1>
<p>Tieghemopanax cussonioides, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
