                    <h1>Taxillus cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Taxillus cavaleriei, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems or branches of its host, typically other woody plants.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is found in various parts of China and is often associated with specific host species such as Elaeocarpus and Syzygium.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
