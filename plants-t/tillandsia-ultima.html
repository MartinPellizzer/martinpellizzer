                    <h1>Tillandsia ultima</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ultima, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ultima is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
