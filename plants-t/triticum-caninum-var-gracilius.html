                    <h1>Triticum caninum var. gracilius</h1>
<p>Triticum caninum var. gracilius, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize various habitats, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
