                    <h1>Triticum sativum var. sinense</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum var. sinense, commonly known as Chinese spring wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its shorter stature and earlier maturation compared to standard wheat varieties.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact growth habit with reduced tillering, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with shorter growing seasons. The plant typically exhibits a range of spikelet structures and glume characteristics that distinguish it from other wheat species. Its genetic makeup includes traits that contribute to its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in improving wheat yield and resilience in temperate climates.</p>
