                    <h1>Trixis antimenorrhoea var. petiolata</h1>
<p>Trixis antimenorrhoea var. petiolata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities.</p>
