<p>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus subsp.</p>
<p>francii, commonly known as the French thlocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to a limited region in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, edible fruits. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
