                    <h1>Tillandsia copanensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia copanensis, commonly known as the Cop√°n air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
