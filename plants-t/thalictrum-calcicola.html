<p>Thalictrum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
