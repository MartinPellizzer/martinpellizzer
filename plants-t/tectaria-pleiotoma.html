                    <h1>Tectaria pleiotoma</h1>
<p>Tectaria pleiotoma, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Tectaria pleiotoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
