                    <h1>Tillandsia clavata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia clavata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
