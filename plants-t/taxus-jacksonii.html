                    <h1>Taxus jacksonii</h1>
<p>Taxus jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's yew, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Taxus jacksonii has a slow growth rate and is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils in forest understory environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
