<p>Tillandsia excelsa, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, capable of trapping moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flower spikes that can reach several feet in height.</p>
<p>Tillandsia excelsa is adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal direct sunlight.</p>
