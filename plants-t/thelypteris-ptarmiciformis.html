<p>Thelypteris ptarmiciformis, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland landscapes.</p>
