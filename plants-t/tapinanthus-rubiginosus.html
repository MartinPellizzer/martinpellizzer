                    <h1>Tapinanthus rubiginosus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rubiginosus, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant or the Indian balm, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant has small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. It lacks true roots and instead attaches to its host through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
