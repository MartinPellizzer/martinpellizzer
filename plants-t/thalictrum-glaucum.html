<p>Thalictrum glaucum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments.</p>
