<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>timopheevii, commonly known as timopheevii wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed glumes and lemma-based florets. It is diploid with a genome size of 2n = 28, and is closely related to other wheat species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in genetic research due to its potential contributions to wheat improvement programs.</p>
