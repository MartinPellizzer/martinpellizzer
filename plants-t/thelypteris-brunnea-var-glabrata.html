                    <h1>Thelypteris brunnea var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Thelypteris brunnea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and smooth to the touch. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal.</p>
