<p>Thecophyllum rubrum, commonly known as the red-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically red or purple in color, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves contain toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Thecophyllum rubrum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance.</p>
