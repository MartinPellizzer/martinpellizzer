                    <h1>Tillandsia lineatifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lineatifolia, commonly known as the linear leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
