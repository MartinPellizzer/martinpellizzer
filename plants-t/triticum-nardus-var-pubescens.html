                    <h1>Triticum nardus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Triticum nardus var. pubescens, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
