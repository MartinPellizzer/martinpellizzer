                    <h1>Tunica alpina</h1>
<p>Tunica alpina, commonly known as the alpine tunica, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique adaptations, Tunica alpina is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
