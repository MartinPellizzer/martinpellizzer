<p>Themelium halconense, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with distinct, star-like lobes that give it its common name. The lichen's upper surface is smooth and often has a waxy appearance, while the lower surface is more rugged and covered in fine, branched filaments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Themelium halconense plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microscopic organisms.</p>
