<p>Triticum ventricosum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a species of wild wheat native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant has alternate, linear leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, indehiscent glumes, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Goatgrass is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
