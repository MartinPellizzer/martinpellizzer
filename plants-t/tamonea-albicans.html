                    <h1>Tamonea albicans</h1>
<p>Tamonea albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces striking white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are typically borne on slender, wiry stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tamonea albicans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
