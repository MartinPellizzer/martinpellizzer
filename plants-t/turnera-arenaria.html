<p>Turnera arenaria, commonly known as the beach turnera, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Turnera arenaria is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
