<p>Tillandsia excelsa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

Its flowers are typically purple or pink and bloom in clusters at the end of the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
