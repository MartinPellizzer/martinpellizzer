<p>Triticum turanicum, commonly known as the Turanian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and crop evolution.</p>
