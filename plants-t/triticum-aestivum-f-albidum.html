                    <h1>Triticum aestivum f. albidum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum f. albidum, commonly known as white wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its reduced pigmentation.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a pale or white coloration in its grains due to a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll production. It is typically found as a natural or cultivated variant within wheat species, often used in specialized breeding programs. The plant retains the general structure of Triticum aestivum, with spikelets and glumes similar to its parent species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for studying wheat diversity and trait inheritance.</p>
