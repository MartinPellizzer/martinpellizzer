                    <h1>Trymatococcus guanabarinus</h1>
<p>Trymatococcus guanabarinus, commonly known as the Guanabara thimblecush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
