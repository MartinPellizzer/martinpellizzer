                    <h1>Tillandsia fulgens var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fulgens var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sun torch, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red inflorescence, which can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the Tillandsia genus. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and relies on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption.</p>
<p>This species is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
