                    <h1>Trophaeum dipetalum</h1>
<p>Trophaeum dipetalum, commonly known as the two-petaled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with two distinct petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
