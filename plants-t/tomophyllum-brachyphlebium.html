                    <h1>Tomophyllum brachyphlebium</h1>
<p>Tomophyllum brachyphlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined tomophyllum, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is typically found in mountainous forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
