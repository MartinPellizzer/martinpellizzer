                    <h1>Terminalia vermae</h1>
<p>Terminalia vermae, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
