                    <h1>Tephrocactus weberi var. setiger</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus weberi var. setiger, commonly known as the Weber's thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>The varietal name "setiger" refers to the presence of stiff, bristly spines along its stems.</p>
