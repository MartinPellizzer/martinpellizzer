<p>Thelypteris decrescens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost shield-like appearance, and are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Thelypteris decrescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
