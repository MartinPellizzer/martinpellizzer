                    <h1>Taxillus tienyensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus tienyensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing some of its own through photosynthesis using limited leaf surface. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by berries. It is native to China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
