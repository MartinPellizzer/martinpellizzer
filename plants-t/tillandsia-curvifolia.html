                    <h1>Tillandsia curvifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia curvifolia, commonly known as the curly leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow, and often curling leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
