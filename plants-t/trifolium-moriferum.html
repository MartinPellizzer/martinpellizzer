                    <h1>Trifolium moriferum</h1>
<p>Trifolium moriferum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Trifolium moriferum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
