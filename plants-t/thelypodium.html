                    <h1>Thelypodium</h1>
<p>Thelypodium, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Thelypodium species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance, but they differ in their leaf structure and flowering habits.</p>
