<p>Trapa natans var. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian water shield, is a variant of the water shield plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is an aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its roots are typically submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
