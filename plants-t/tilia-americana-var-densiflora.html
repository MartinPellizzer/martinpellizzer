                    <h1>Tilia americana var. densiflora</h1>
<p>Tilia americana var. densiflora, commonly known as the American Basswood or Small-leaf Linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more densely packed than those of the common linden. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are an important food source for bees and other pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The wood is soft and lightweight, making it suitable for carving and interior finishes.</p>
