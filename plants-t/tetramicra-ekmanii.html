                    <h1>Tetramicra ekmanii</h1>
<p>Tetramicra ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekmans' tetramicra, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it forms dense mats of foliage. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetramicra ekmanii is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
