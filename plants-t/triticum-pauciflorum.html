                    <h1>Triticum pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Triticum pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flower wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few florets, which is reflected in its scientific name. Its flowers are typically green or pale blue, and it is native to central Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying wheat evolution.</p>
