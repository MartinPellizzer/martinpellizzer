<p>Tricratus arenarius, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its flowers typically open in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Tricratus arenarius plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
