<p>Taxanthema emarginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf taxanthema, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Taxanthema emarginatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects and small animals.</p>
