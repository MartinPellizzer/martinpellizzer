                <h1>Tacinga quipa</h1>
<p>Tacinga quipa, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate and serrated, with a grayish-green hue due to the thick, hairy coating.</p>
<p>Tacinga quipa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, dry climates of its native habitat.</p>
