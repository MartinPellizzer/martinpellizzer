                    <h1>Tupacamaria</h1>
<p>Tupacamaria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Tupacamaria is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and for making incense.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
