                    <h1>Tillandsia moscosoi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia moscosoi, commonly known as the Moscoso air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
