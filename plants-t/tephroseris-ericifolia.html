                    <h1>Tephroseris ericifolia</h1>
<p>Tephroseris ericifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Tephroseris ericifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is a characteristic component of tundra and alpine vegetation.</p>
