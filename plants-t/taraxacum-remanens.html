                    <h1>Taraxacum remanens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum remanens, commonly known as the remnant dandelion, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
