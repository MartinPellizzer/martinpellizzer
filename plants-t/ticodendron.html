                    <h1>Ticodendron</h1>
<p>Ticodendron, commonly known as the "dwarf mistletoe," is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds. Ticodendron lacks true roots and has a simple, branched structure with scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
