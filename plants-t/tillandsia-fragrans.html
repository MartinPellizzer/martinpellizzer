                    <h1>Tillandsia fragrans</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
