                    <h1>Taraxacum fulvobrunneum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum fulvobrunneum, commonly known as the brownish dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other dandelion species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
