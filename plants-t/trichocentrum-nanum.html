                    <h1>Trichocentrum nanum</h1>
<p>Trichocentrum nanum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf phalaenopsis, is a compact epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features short, upright pseudobulbs with dark green, ovate leaves that are relatively small in size. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in a raceme, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
