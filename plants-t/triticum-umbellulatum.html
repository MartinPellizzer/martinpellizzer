The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Triticum umbellulatum is of interest to plant breeders due to its potential for improving wheat varieties through genetic diversity.</p>
