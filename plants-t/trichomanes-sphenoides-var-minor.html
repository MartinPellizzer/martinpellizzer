                    <h1>Trichomanes sphenoides var. minor</h1>
<p>Trichomanes sphenoides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often growing in dense mats on the water's surface or submerged in shallow water. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Hymenophyllum genus and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
