                    <h1>Tripterella capitata</h1>
<p>Tripterella capitata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its branches, giving it its common name. Tripterella capitata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic contexts.</p>
