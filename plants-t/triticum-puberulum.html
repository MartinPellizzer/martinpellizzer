<p>Triticum puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheat or slender wheat, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for grain, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and historical significance.</p>
