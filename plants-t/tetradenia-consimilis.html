                    <h1>Tetradenia consimilis</h1>
<p>Tetradenia consimilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetradenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting native pollinators. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Tetradenia consimilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
