<p>Trigonia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Trigonia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
