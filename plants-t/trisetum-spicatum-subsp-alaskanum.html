<p>Trisetum spicatum subsp.</p>
<p>alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form low, compact clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, with short, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in wetland environments.</p>
