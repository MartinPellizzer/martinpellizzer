<p>Trisetella escobarii, commonly known as the Escobarii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Trisetella escobarii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
