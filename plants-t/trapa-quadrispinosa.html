<p>Trapa quadrispinosa, commonly known as the four-spined water shield, is a water-dwelling plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves with a waxy upper surface and a broad, fan-shaped lower surface. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are buoyant and contain a single seed. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Trapa quadrispinosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
