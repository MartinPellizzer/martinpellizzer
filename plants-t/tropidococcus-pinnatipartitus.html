<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, lobed appearance that resembles a palm leaf, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flat body called a thallus.</p>
