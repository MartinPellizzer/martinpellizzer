                    <h1>Triticum polonicum var. deformatum</h1>
<p>Triticum polonicum var. deformatum, commonly known as the Polish rye or deformed rye, is a variant of the rye plant characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to Central and Eastern Europe. The plant typically exhibits reduced grain size and irregular spikelet development, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in marginal agricultural environments.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic variability, it is sometimes used in breeding programs to enhance resilience in rye cultivars.</p>
