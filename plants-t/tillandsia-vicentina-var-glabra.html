<p>Tillandsia vicentina var. glabra, commonly known as the bare-leaved air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
