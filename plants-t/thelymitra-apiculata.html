<p>Thelymitra apiculata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a yellow dorsal sepal and a greenish-yellow labellum, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It blooms during spring and early summer, often after rainfall.</p>
<p>Thelymitra apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
