<p>Tristiropsis ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf tristiropsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristiropsis ovata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
