                    <h1>Tillaea tuberella</h1>
<p>Tillaea tuberella, commonly known as the cushion tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils and store moisture.</p>
<p>Tillaea tuberella is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
