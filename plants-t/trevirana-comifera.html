<p>Trevirana comifera, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Trevirana comifera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas.</p>
