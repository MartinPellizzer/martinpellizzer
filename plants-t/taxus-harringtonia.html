<p>Taxus harringtonia, commonly known as the Harrington's yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Taxus harringtonia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
