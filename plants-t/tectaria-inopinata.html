<p>Tectaria inopinata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Tectaria inopinata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
