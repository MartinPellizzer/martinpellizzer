                    <h1>Tillandsia canescens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia canescens, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
