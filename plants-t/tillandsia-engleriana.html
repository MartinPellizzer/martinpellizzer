                    <h1>Tillandsia engleriana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia engleriana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
