                    <h1>Tillandsia pohliana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pohliana, commonly known as the Pohl's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
