                    <h1>Thelypteris urdanetensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNet fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris urdanetensis thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
