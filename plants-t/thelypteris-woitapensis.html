<p>Thelypteris woitapensis, commonly known as the Woitap fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered into strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance.</p>
