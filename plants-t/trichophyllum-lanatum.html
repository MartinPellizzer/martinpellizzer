                    <h1>Trichophyllum lanatum</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum lanatum, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a species of moss that belongs to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and soft, velvety texture due to its dense covering of short, hair-like structures. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
