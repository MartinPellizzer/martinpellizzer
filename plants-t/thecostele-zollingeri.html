<p>Thecostele zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's costele, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the pattern of a helix, a feature that sets it apart from other plant species. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, making it ideal for small garden spaces or indoor cultivation. Its foliage is often a deep green with a slight sheen, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not particularly showy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
