                    <h1>Trifolium microcephalum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Trifolium microcephalum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-headed clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically rounded and glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
