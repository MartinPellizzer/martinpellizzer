                    <h1>Tillandsia schiedeana var. totolapanensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia schiedeana var. totolapanensis, commonly known as the Totolapan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
