<p>Thalictrum simplex var. rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white, sparrow-paw-shaped flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
