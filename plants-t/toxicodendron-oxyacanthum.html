                    <h1>Toxicodendron oxyacanthum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron oxyacanthum, commonly known as the Southern Pokeweed, is a member of the Spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple midrib, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release poisonous, dark purple berries, which are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its irritant properties, it is often avoided in gardens and natural areas.</p>
