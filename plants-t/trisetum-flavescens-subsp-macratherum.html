<p>Trisetum flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>macratherum, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in sunlight.</p>
<p>The species is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
