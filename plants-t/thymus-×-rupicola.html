                    <h1>Thymus × rupicola</h1>
<p>Thymus × rupicola, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, small gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens for both its fragrance and visual appeal.</p>
