<p>Trichinium remotiflorum, commonly known as the distant-flower trichinium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It is primarily found in rocky soils and is often associated with alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
