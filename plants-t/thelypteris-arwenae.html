                    <h1>Thelypteris arwenae</h1>
<p>Thelypteris arwenae, commonly known as the Arwen holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris arwenae is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
