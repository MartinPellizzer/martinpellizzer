                    <h1>Taraxacum damnabile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum damnabile, commonly known as the bastard dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule that releases numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, a common reproductive strategy among members of the genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum damnabile is closely related to the common dandelion, but it differs in its leaf structure and habitat preferences.</p>
