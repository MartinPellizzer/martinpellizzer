<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and epiphytic growth habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
