                    <h1>Thymus vulgaris var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Thymus vulgaris var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly thymol and carvacrol. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to its more common relative, Thymus vulgaris.</p>
