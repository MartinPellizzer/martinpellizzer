                    <h1>Triodia glaberrima</h1>
<p>Triodia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth triodia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers, which appear in late summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Triodia glaberrima plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range.</p>
