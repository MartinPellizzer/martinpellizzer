                    <h1>Taraxacum balticiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum balticiforme, commonly known as the Baltic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flowering head, which eventually develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
