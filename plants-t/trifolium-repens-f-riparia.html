                    <h1>Trifolium repens f. riparia</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens f. riparia, commonly known as the riparian white clover, is a variant of the common white clover.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a pale green to white coloration, distinguishing it from the typical green leaves of the species. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
