The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, which is a distinguishing feature from other wheat varieties. Its botanical structure includes a short, sturdy stem with alternate leaves that are narrow and linear.</p>
<p>This variety is often studied for its potential in agricultural breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
