                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. majus</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. majus, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender spikes and compact grains that are typically amber to brown in color. The plant has a short growth cycle and is highly drought-resistant, making it suitable for marginal agricultural environments. Its genome is smaller and simpler compared to modern wheat varieties, which makes it valuable for genetic research.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is rich in nutrients and has been cultivated for thousands of years, contributing to early human agriculture.</p>
