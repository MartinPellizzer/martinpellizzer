                    <h1>Taraxacum macilentum var. hyperboreum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum macilentum var. hyperboreum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and arctic tundra environments, where it thrives in low temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems.</p>
