                    <h1>Timonius subauritus var. strigosus</h1>
<p>Timonius subauritus var. strigosus, commonly known as the hairy timonius, is a lesser-known species within the Timonius genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its specific epithet "strigosus," meaning "hairy" in Latin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited geographic distribution.</p>
