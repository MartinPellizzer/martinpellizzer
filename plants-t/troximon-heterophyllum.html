                    <h1>Troximon heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Troximon heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are highly branched and can become quite thick over time, providing structural support in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
