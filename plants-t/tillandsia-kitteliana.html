                    <h1>Tillandsia kitteliana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia kitteliana, commonly known as the Kittel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia kitteliana is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
