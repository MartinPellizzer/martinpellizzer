                    <h1>Thuniopsis</h1>
<p>Thuniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Thuniopsis thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
