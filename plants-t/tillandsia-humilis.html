                    <h1>Tillandsia humilis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia humilis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for nourishment, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant's long, hanging strands of soft, greenish-gray foliage create a dense, moss-like appearance. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a member of the bromeliad family.</p>
