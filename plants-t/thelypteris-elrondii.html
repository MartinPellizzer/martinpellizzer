<p>Thelypteris elrondii, commonly known as the elfin fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of the fictional plant from J.R.R. Tolkien's works.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish roots, and the fronds are bipinnate, with a finely divided structure.</p>
<p>Thelypteris elrondii thrives in humid climates and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests.</p>
