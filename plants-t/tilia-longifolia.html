                    <h1>Tilia longifolia</h1>
<p>Tilia longifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf lime or European small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller and more pointed than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Tilia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
