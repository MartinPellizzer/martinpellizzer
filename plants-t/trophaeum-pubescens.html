                    <h1>Trophaeum pubescens</h1>
<p>Trophaeum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
