                    <h1>Toxicodendron orientale f. rishiriense</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron orientale f. rishiriense, commonly known as the Rishiri Island lacquer tree, is a variant of the lacquer tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clusters of red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>However, like its parent species, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic resin.</p>
