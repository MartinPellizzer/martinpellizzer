                    <h1>Troximon aurantiacum var. purpureum</h1>
<p>Troximon aurantiacum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple petals and sepals, which contrast with its pale greenish-yellow leaves. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
