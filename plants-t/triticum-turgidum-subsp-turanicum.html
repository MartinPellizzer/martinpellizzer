<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>turanicum, commonly known as the Central Asian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-lobed grains. It is primarily cultivated for its hardy nature and adaptability to arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in improving wheat varieties through genetic diversity.</p>
