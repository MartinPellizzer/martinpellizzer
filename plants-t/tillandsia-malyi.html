                    <h1>Tillandsia malyi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia malyi, commonly known as the Maly's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia malyi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
