                    <h1>Thismia clavigeroides</h1>
<p>Thismia clavigeroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, often resembling a ghostly appearance due to their translucent petals.</p>
<p>Thismia clavigeroides is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making it a symbol of botanical rarity and conservation concern.</p>
