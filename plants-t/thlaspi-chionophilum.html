                    <h1>Thlaspi chionophilum</h1>
<p>Thlaspi chionophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving rockcress, is a hardy plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of wax, which reduces water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Thlaspi chionophilum is often found in rocky crevices and high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
