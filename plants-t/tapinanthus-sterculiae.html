                    <h1>Tapinanthus sterculiae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus sterculiae, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to derive some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth of host plants.</p>
