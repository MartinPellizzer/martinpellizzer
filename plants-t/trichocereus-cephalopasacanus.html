                    <h1>Trichocereus cephalopasacanus</h1>
<p>Trichocereus cephalopasacanus, commonly known as the sacred cactus or the "mirror cactus," is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that bloom at night, often emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, ribbed structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline, making it significant in both cultural and botanical contexts.</p>
