<p>Thelypteris benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
