                    <h1>Tillandsia segregata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia segregata, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, hair-like trichomes, which aid in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
