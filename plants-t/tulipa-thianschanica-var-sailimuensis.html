                    <h1>Tulipa thianschanica var. sailimuensis</h1>
<p>Tulipa thianschanica var. sailimuensis, commonly known as the Sailimu tulip, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white, with a distinctive cup-shaped form. The plant prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure, thriving in alpine environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a period of cold dormancy to produce flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
