                    <h1>Tillandsia hieronymi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hieronymi, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives without soil by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America, often found growing on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant's dense, hanging clusters of pale green to brown threads create a distinctive, lace-like appearance. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
