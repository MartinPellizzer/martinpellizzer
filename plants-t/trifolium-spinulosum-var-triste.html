                    <h1>Trifolium spinulosum var. triste</h1>
<p>Trifolium spinulosum var. triste, commonly known as the weeping clover, is a rare and delicate species of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
