                    <h1>Tragacantha scleroxylon</h1>
<p>Tragacantha scleroxylon, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and long, slender leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by pods containing a sticky, resinous sap known as tragacanth. This sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>The tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
