                            <h1>Tractema Verna</h1>
<p>Spring beauty, scientifically known as Tractema verna, is a delicate flowering plant that heralds the arrival of spring with its vibrant blooms. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats where it spreads its slender, hairy stems. Its small, cup-shaped flowers, often pink or white, appear early in the season, making it a symbol of renewal and resilience. Despite its modest size, the plant plays an important role in supporting early pollinators like bees and butterflies. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare and beautiful species from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
