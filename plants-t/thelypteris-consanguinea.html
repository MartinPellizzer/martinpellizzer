<p>Thelypteris consanguinea, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Thelypteris consanguinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
