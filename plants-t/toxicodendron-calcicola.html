<p>Toxicodendron calcicola, commonly known as the desert poison oak, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants known for their urushiol-containing sap. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is toxic due to the presence of urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
