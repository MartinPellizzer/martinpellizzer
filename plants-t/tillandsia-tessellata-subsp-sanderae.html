<p>Tillandsia tessellata subsp.</p>
<p>sanderae, commonly known as the Sanderae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant features rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
