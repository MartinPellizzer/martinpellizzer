                    <h1>Tillandsia dependens var. percordobensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dependens var. percordobensis, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
