<p>Tragia infesta, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, blooming in the morning. Tragia infesta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, which aids in dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
