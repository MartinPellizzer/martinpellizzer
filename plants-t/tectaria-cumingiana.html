<p>Tectaria cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Tectaria cumingiana is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
