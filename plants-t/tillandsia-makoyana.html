                    <h1>Tillandsia makoyana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia makoyana, commonly known as the Makoy's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
