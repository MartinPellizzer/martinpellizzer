                    <h1>Taraxacum subhirtellum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subhirtellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions.</p>
