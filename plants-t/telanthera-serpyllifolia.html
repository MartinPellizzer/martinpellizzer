                    <h1>Telanthera serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Telanthera serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, giving it its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Telanthera serpyllifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
