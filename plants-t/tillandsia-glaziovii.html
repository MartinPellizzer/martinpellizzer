                    <h1>Tillandsia glaziovii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia glaziovii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
