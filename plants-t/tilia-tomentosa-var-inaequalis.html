                    <h1>Tilia tomentosa var. inaequalis</h1>
<p>Tilia tomentosa var. inaequalis, commonly known as the woolly lime or the unequal-leaf lime, is a variant of the small-leaf linden.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on young shoots and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are often unequal in size along the petiole, hence its botanical name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
