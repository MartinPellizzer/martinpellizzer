<p>Tragacantha procera, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick, resinous coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its resin, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha procera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
