                    <h1>Tamarix stricta</h1>
<p>Tamarix stricta, commonly known as the saltbush, is a small, deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix stricta is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in coastal areas where other plants struggle.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it useful for erosion control in harsh climates.</p>
