                    <h1>Tillandsia crenulipetala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia crenulipetala, commonly known as the serrated-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight.</p>
