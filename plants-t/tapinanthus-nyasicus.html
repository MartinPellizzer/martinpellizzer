                    <h1>Tapinanthus nyasicus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus nyasicus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of East Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, twining stem that attaches to its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
