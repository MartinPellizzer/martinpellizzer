<p>Thelypteris supraspinigera, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
