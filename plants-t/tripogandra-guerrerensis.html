<p>Tripogandra guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrero tripogandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tripogandra guerrerensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity in Mesoamerica.</p>
