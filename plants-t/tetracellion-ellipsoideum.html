                    <h1>Tetracellion ellipsoideum</h1>
<p>Tetracellion ellipsoideum, commonly known as the ellipsoidal diatom, is a unicellular algae belonging to the class Bacillariophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate silica cell wall, known as a frustule, which is composed of two overlapping halves. The frustule of Tetracellion ellipsoideum typically exhibits a symmetrical, ellipsoidal shape with finely structured patterns. It is commonly found in freshwater environments, such as lakes and rivers, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>This diatom is often used in paleolimnological studies to infer past environmental conditions.</p>
