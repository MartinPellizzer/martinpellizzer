<p>Tillandsia chapalillaensis, commonly known as the Chapalilla air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on trees or rocks in humid, misty conditions. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of pink or white, and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
