<p>Toxicodendron radicans subsp.</p>
<p>negundo, commonly known as the sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain urushiol, a skin irritant that can cause allergic reactions in many people.</p>
