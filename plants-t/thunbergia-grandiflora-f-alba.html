                    <h1>Thunbergia grandiflora f. alba</h1>
<p>Thunbergia grandiflora f. alba, commonly known as the white thunbergia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in humid climates.</p>
<p>The white variety is distinguished by its lack of the typical blue or purple pigmentation found in other forms of Thunbergia.</p>
