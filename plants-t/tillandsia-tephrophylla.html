                    <h1>Tillandsia tephrophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tephrophylla, commonly known as the tephrophylla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
