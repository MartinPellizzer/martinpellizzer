                    <h1>Tillandsia ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
