<p>Triticum spelta var. ispharosubbaktiaricum, commonly known as a rare and ancient wheat species, is characterized by its unique botanical features, including its slender, spike-like inflorescence and small, glumeless florets.</p>
<p>It is a hexaploid grass species with a complex genome structure, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in marginal agricultural areas. Its grain is smaller and more compact compared to common wheat, with a higher protein content and distinct flavor profile.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance and potential nutritional benefits, it is gaining interest in modern agriculture and food science.</p>
