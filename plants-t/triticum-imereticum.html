                    <h1>Triticum imereticum</h1>
<p>Triticum imereticum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are typically used for forage rather than human consumption. Triticum imereticum is closely related to domesticated wheat species and shares similar genetic traits.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important study in the evolution of cereal crops.</p>
