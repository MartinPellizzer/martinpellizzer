                    <h1>Tragacantha arnoceras</h1>
<p>Tragacantha arnoceras, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick layer of resinous exudate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum.</p>
