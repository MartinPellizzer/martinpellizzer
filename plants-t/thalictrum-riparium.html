<p>Thalictrum riparium, commonly known as water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America.</p>

The plant features slender stems with whorled leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture. Its showy, greenish-white flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in loose cymes, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
