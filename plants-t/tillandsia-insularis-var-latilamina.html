                    <h1>Tillandsia insularis var. latilamina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia insularis var. latilamina, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are dense and covered in a fine, white trichome layer, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
