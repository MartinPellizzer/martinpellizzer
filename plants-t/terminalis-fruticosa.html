<p>Terminalis fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub, is a hardy plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, woody stems that form a shrub-like structure, often with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Terminalis fruticosa is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for erosion control and habitat support.</p>
