                    <h1>Tapanhuacanga</h1>
<p>Tapanhuacanga, commonly known as the "flower of the sun," is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Cochlearia* within the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often resembling miniature suns. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Tapanhuacanga is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
