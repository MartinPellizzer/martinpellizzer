                    <h1>Trachystylis stradbrokensis</h1>
<p>Trachystylis stradbrokensis, commonly known as the Stradbroke flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that bear the flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often in dune environments, and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Trachystylis stradbrokensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
