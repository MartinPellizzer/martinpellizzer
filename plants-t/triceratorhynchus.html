                    <h1>Triceratorhynchus</h1>
<p>Triceratorhynchus, commonly known as the three-horned orchid, is a rare and exotic species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three prominent horns on the base of its flowers, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the late winter and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Triceratorhynchus is highly valued by botanists and collectors due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
