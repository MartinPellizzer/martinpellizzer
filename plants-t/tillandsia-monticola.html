                    <h1>Tillandsia monticola</h1>
<p>Tillandsia monticola, commonly known as the mountain tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense structure, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the humid air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia monticola is well adapted to its high-altitude environment, with specialized structures that allow it to thrive in low-light, moist conditions.</p>
