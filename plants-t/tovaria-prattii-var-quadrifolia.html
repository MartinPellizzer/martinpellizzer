                    <h1>Tovaria prattii var. quadrifolia</h1>
<p>Tovaria prattii var. quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf tovaria, is a rare and unique variant of the tovaria plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive quadrifoliate leaves, which consist of four lobes arranged symmetrically, giving it an ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tovaria prattii var. quadrifolia is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
