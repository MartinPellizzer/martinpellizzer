                    <h1>Thelypteris stellatopilosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris stellatopilosa, commonly known as the star-pilose fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, star-shaped hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait in ferns that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
