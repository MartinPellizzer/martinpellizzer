<p>Tussacia rupestris, commonly known as the rock tussac, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted, wiry growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in harsh, well-drained environments and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Tussacia rupestris plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
