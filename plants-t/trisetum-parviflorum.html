                <h1>Trisetum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Trisetum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Trisetum parviflorum is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats, preferring partially wet soils.</p>
