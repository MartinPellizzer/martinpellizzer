                    <h1>Taraxacum rufum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum rufum, commonly known as the red-seed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flower head and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dandelions. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Taraxacum rufum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
