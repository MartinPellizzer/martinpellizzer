                    <h1>Tillandsia rutschmannii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rutschmannii, commonly known as the Rutschmann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rutschmannii is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
