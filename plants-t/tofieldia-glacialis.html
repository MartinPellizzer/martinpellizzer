                    <h1>Tofieldia glacialis</h1>
<p>Tofieldia glacialis, commonly known as the Arctic clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with closely packed, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage.</p>
<p>Tofieldia glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species of cold climates.</p>
