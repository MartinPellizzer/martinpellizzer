<p>Tragacantha subacaulis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>Tragacantha subacaulis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
