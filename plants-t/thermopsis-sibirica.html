<p>Thermopsis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with compound leaves and a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Thermopsis sibirica is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
