                    <h1>Tilia orocryptica</h1>
<p>Tilia orocryptica, commonly known as the mountain linden, is a rare and endemic tree species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tilia orocryptica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
