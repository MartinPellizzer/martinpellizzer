                    <h1>Trifolium arvense</h1>
<p>Trifolium arvense, commonly known as field clover, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Field clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in agricultural systems for soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
