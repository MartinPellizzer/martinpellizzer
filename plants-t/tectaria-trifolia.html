<p>Tectaria trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria trifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications.</p>
