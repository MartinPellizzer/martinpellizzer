                    <h1>Tumionella monactis</h1>
<p>Tumionella monactis, commonly known as the single-actinomycete plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a single, elongated bract that supports a single umbel of small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tumionella monactis is considered a botanically significant but under-studied species.</p>
