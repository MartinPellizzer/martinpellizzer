                    <h1>Triticum × schlanstedtense</h1>
<p>Triticum × schlanstedtense, commonly known as the Schlanstedt hybrid rye, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between rye (Triticum aestivum) and wheat (Triticum turgidum).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant does not produce viable seeds, making it primarily useful for research and breeding programs. Its genetic makeup offers insights into the evolution and hybridization of cereal crops.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it is not cultivated for agricultural purposes but is valuable in studying genetic diversity and polyploidy in grasses.</p>
