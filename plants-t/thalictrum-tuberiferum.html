                    <h1>Thalictrum tuberiferum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum tuberiferum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system composed of tubers, which store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, usually greenish or yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply divided, giving the plant a fern-like appearance, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Thalictrum tuberiferum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
