<p>Toxicophlaea cestroides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Toxicophlaea cestroides is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
