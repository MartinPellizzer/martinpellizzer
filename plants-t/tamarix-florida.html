<p>Tamarix florida, commonly known as the Florida tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, pink to rose-colored flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
