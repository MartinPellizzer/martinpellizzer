<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in sharp, tuberculate spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
