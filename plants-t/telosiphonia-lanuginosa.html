<p>Telosiphonia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly sea lettuce, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent thallus covered in fine, fuzzy structures that give it a woolly appearance. This marine plant typically grows in intertidal zones, where it thrives in shallow, brackish or saltwater environments. Its structure consists of a flat, blade-like body with a central rib, and it reproduces through the release of zoospores into the water.</p>
<p>Telosiphonia lanuginosa plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
