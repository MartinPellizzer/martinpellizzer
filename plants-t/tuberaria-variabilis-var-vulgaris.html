                    <h1>Tuberaria variabilis var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Tuberaria variabilis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common tuberaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cariophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fleshy, tuberous roots that help it store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is typically found in rocky soils and dry habitats across southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
