                    <h1>Trifolium repens var. orbelicum</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens var. orbelicum, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This variety is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its ecological benefits in supporting pollinators.</p>
