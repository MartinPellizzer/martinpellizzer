                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. recognitum</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. recognitum, commonly known as the dwarf wheat or compact wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its short stature and dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Mediterranean region. This plant typically produces small, hard grains that are well-suited for certain agricultural conditions. It is often used in breeding programs to improve disease resistance and adaptability in wheat crops.</p>
<p>Its compact form makes it less prone to lodging, which is a common issue in taller wheat varieties.</p>
