                    <h1>Thesium euphrasioides</h1>
<p>Thesium euphrasioides, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Thesium euphrasioides is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy landscapes.</p>
