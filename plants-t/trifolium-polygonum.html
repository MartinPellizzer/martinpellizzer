                    <h1>Trifolium polygonum</h1>
<p>Trifolium polygonum, commonly known as lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium polygonum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in various soil conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
