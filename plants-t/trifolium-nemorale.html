                    <h1>Trifolium nemorale</h1>
<p>Trifolium nemorale, commonly known as wood clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium nemorale thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
