                    <h1>Toxicodendron dissectum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron dissectum, commonly known as the itch leaf or poison ivy, is a shrub native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that causes severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its potent allergens, it is considered a common but dangerous weed in many regions.</p>
