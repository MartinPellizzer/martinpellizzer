<p>Tamarix epacroides, commonly known as the desert rose or sand tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its roots can penetrate deep into the soil to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Tamarix epacroides is also known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
