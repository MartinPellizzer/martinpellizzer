<p>Trigonopterum, commonly known as the three-lobed moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, with a creeping growth habit and a dense, cushion-like appearance. They are characterized by their three-lobed leaves, which are often sharply pointed and arranged in a spiral. Trigonopterum species are commonly found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
