                    <h1>Tittelbachia hamiltoniana</h1>
<p>Tittelbachia hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's tittelbachia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
