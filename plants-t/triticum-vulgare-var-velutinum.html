                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. velutinum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. velutinum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned glumes, which contain the florets that develop into grains. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive texture.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for grain, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
