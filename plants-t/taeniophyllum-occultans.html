<p>Taeniophyllum occultans, commonly known as the ghost moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it a spectral appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
