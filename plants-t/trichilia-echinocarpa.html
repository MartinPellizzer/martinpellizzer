                    <h1>Trichilia echinocarpa</h1>
<p>Trichilia echinocarpa, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing flat, edible seeds. These seeds are the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
