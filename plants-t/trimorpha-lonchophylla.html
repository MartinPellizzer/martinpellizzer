                    <h1>Trimorpha lonchophylla</h1>
<p>Trimorpha lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for attachment to its host. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
