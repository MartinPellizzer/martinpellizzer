                    <h1>Trixis missionum</h1>
<p>Trixis missionum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with silver-green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Trixis missionum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
