                    <h1>Tillandsia drewii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia drewii, commonly known as the silver star tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white to pale purple inflorescences that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
