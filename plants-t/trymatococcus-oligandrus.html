                    <h1>Trymatococcus oligandrus</h1>
<p>Trymatococcus oligandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
