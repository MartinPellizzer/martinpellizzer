<p>Taraxacum exsertum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets, which later develops into a distinctive, hollow stem with a crown of bracts. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Taraxacum exsertum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
