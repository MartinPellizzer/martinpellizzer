                    <h1>Terniopsis ubonensis</h1>
<p>Terniopsis ubonensis, commonly known as the Ubon fern, is a rare tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Terniopsidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, spore-producing capsules that are clustered along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Terniopsis ubonensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
