<p>Thelypteris walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, upright growth habit and its ability to form dense clumps.</p>
<p>It has feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. Thelypteris walkeri is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
