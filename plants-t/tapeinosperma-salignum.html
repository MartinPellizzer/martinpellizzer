<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal ecosystems.</p>
