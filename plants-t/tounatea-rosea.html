<p>Tounatea rosea, commonly known as the pink velvet tunicate, is a marine organism belonging to the phylum Chordata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a pink, velvety coat. This species is typically found attached to surfaces in coastal waters, where it filters plankton from the water. Tounatea rosea plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a filter feeder and a food source for various marine animals.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for marine biology studies.</p>
