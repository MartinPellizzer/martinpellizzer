                    <h1>Torreya nucifera f. sphaerica</h1>
<p>Torreya nucifera f. sphaerica, commonly known as the spherical torreya, is a unique cultivar of the Torreya genus native to East Asia.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its rounded, compact growth habit, which sets it apart from the typical elongated form of the species. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and lanceolate, often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are a delicacy in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservatories.</p>
