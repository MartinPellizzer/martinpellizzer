                    <h1>Tillandsia acaulis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia acaulis, commonly known as the stemless air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves forming a cup-like structure that collects water and nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia acaulis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
