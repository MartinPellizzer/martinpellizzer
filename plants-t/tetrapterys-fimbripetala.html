<p>Tetrapterys fimbripetala, commonly known as the fringed-leaved acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with fringed margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Tetrapterys fimbripetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
