<p>Tamarix africana var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, making it well adapted to saline and alkaline soils. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its feathery leaves are deciduous, shedding during dry seasons to conserve water.</p>
<p>This species is often used in reclamation projects due to its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
