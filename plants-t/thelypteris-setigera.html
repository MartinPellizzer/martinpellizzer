<p>Thelypteris setigera, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is not commonly observed in T. setigera.</p>
