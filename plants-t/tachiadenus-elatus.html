<p>Tachiadenus elatus, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant has a distinctive, candle-like shape with a single stem that supports a cluster of small white flowers. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tachiadenus elatus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and exhibiting a slow growth rate.</p>
