                    <h1>Tainus pitreanus</h1>
<p>Tainus pitreanus, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tainus pitreanus is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
