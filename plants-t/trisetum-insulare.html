<p>Trisetum insulare, commonly known as the island hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various islands in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or island environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetum insulare plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
