                    <h1>Taxus baccata var. recurvata</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata var. recurvata, commonly known as the curly leaf yew, is a rare variant of the European yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and curling foliage, which sets it apart from the standard Taxus baccata. The plant is evergreen, with dark green, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>This variety is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture.</p>
