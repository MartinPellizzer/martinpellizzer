                    <h1>Trachydium rockii</h1>
<p>Trachydium rockii, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its unique thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming a crust-like growth that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant's morphology includes a leathery, dark-colored cortex with a finely branched medulla, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure, such as mountainous areas and deserts.</p>
<p>Trachydium rockii plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
