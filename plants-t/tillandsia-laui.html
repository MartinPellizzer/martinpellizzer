                    <h1>Tillandsia laui</h1>
<p>Tillandsia laui, commonly known as the Laui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red.</p>
<p>Tillandsia laui is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
