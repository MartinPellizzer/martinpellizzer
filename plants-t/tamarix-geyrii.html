                    <h1>Tamarix geyrii</h1>
<p>Tamarix geyrii, commonly known as the Geyrii tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces dense clusters of pink or pale red flowers, which bloom in summer and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Tamarix geyrii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native range.</p>
