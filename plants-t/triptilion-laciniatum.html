                    <h1>Triptilion laciniatum</h1>
<p>Triptilion laciniatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
