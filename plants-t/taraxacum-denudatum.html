                    <h1>Taraxacum denudatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum denudatum, commonly known as the naked dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which produce seeds with fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. This plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its reduced leaf structure and habitat preferences.</p>
