<p>Taraxacum buttleri, commonly known as the Butler's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum buttleri is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
