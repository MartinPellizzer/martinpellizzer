                    <h1>Tillandsia erubescens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia erubescens, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking red and orange flowers bloom in the summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Tillandsia erubescens is popular as a decorative plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
