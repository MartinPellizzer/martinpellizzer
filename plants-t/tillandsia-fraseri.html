                    <h1>Tillandsia fraseri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Tillandsia fraseri is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
