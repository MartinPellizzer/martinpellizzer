<p>Trapa longicarpa f. alticarpa, commonly known as the highland water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, floating leaves and spiny, spherical fruit that contains edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in lakes and ponds at higher elevations. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy.</p>
<p>The fruit matures in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
