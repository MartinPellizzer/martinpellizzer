<p>Tricholobus conchocarpus, commonly known as the conchocarpus mushroom, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped, woody fruiting bodies that often grow on dead wood. The cap is typically pale yellow to brown, with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface. The stem is short and stubby, and the spore-bearing surface is located on the underside of the cap.</p>
<p>This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
