                    <h1>Triticum amylosum</h1>
<p>Triticum amylosum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive type of grain that is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Triticum amylosum is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in plant genetics and evolutionary biology.</p>
