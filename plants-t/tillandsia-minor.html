                    <h1>Tillandsia minor</h1>
<p>Tillandsia minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, rather than through soil. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, Tillandsia minor is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
