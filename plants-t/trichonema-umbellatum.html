<p>Trichonema umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a central axis and radiating lobes that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Trichonema umbellatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
