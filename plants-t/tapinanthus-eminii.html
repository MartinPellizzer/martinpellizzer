                    <h1>Tapinanthus eminii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus eminii, commonly known as the Ethiopian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to its death.</p>
