                    <h1>Tillaea subulata</h1>
<p>Tillaea subulata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in small, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Tillaea subulata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
