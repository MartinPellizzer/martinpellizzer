                    <h1>Tectaria holttumii</h1>
<p>Tectaria holttumii, commonly known as the Holttum's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
