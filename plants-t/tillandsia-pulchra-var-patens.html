                    <h1>Tillandsia pulchra var. patens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pulchra var. patens, commonly known as the Patens air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
