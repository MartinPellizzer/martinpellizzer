                    <h1>Taraxacum taraxacoides var. laevigatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum taraxacoides var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine white coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a cluster of yellow flowers, which develop into spherical, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to other dandelion species.</p>
