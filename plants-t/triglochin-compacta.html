                    <h1>Triglochin compacta</h1>
<p>Triglochin compacta, commonly known as the compact spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Triglochin compacta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
