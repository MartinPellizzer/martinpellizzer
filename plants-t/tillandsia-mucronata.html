                    <h1>Tillandsia mucronata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
