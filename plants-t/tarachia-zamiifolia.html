                    <h1>Tarachia zamiifolia</h1>
<p>Tarachia zamiifolia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped form and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tarachia zamiifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
