                    <h1>Trifolium depauperatum var. truncatum</h1>
<p>Trifolium depauperatum var. truncatum, commonly known as the truncate clover, is a rare and diminutive species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with rounded or truncated leaflets, which distinguish it from other clover varieties. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
