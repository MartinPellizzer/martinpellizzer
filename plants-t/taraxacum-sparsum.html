                    <h1>Taraxacum sparsum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum sparsum, commonly known as the sparse dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, with historically used parts including the leaves and roots for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
