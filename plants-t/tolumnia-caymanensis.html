<p>Tolumnia caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adapted to the island's arid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
