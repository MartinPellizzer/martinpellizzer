                    <h1>Tursenia</h1>
<p>Tursenia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tursenia species produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in drought-prone areas.</p>
