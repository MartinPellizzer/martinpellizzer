<p>Triticum durum acutidenticulatum, commonly known as the acute-dentate durum wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil conditions. Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in understanding the evolution and domestication of wheat crops.</p>
