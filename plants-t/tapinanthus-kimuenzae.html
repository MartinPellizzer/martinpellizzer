                    <h1>Tapinanthus kimuenzae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus kimuenzae, commonly known as the Kimuenza dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the stems of other plants in the Ericaceae family. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still requires a host for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
