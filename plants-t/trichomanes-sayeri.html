<p>Trichomanes sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature common in many primitive ferns.</p>
<p>Trichomanes sayeri is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its habitat.</p>
