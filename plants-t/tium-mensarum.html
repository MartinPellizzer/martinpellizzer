                    <h1>Tium mensarum</h1>
<p>Tium mensarum, commonly known as the "moonflower of the mountains," is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Tium mensarum is valued not only for its aesthetic beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
