<p>Thelypteris pseudoacuminata, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a dense, shield-like appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
