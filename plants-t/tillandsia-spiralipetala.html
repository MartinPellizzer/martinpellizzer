                    <h1>Tillandsia spiralipetala</h1>
<p>Tillandsia spiralipetala, commonly known as the spiral-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and spirally arranged, which helps it capture moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia spiralipetala is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
