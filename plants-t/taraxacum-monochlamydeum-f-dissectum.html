                    <h1>Taraxacum monochlamydeum f. dissectum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum monochlamydeum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical dandelion. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head with yellow ray florets, followed by a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and meadows.</p>
<p>This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique leaf structure.</p>
