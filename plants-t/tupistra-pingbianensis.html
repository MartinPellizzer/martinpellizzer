<p>Tupistra pingbianensis, commonly known as the Pingbian yew, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Taxaceae family, which includes yew trees, and is characterized by its coniferous appearance with needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril, a feature common among many yew species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tupistra pingbianensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
