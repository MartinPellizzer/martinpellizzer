<p>Thymus × josephi-angeli nothosubsp.</p>
<p>occultus, commonly known as the rare hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves and flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, characteristic of the Thymus genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical significance lies in its hybrid origin, combining traits from its parent species, T. josephi and T. angeli.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
