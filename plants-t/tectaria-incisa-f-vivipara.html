                    <h1>Tectaria incisa f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Tectaria incisa f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous shield fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with broad, leathery fronds that have a shield-like appearance. One of its most notable features is viviparity, where spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and can germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows for more efficient propagation in its natural habitat.</p>
