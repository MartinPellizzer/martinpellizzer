<p>Tamarix gallica subsp.</p>
<p>speciosa, commonly known as the silver tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, scale-like leaves that give it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
