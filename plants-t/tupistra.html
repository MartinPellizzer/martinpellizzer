                    <h1>Tupistra</h1>
<p>Tupistra, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often in clusters at the ends of stems. Tupistra species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their ability to survive in poor soil conditions makes them popular among gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants.</p>
