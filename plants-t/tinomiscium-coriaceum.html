                    <h1>Tinomiscium coriaceum</h1>
<p>Tinomiscium coriaceum, commonly known as the thick-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Tinomiscium coriaceum is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
