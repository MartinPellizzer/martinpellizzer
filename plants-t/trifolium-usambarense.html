                    <h1>Trifolium usambarense</h1>
<p>Trifolium usambarense, commonly known as the Usambare clover, is a perennial legume native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Trifolium usambarense plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
