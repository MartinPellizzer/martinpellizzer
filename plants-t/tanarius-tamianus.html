                    <h1>Tanarius tamianus</h1>
<p>Tanarius tamianus, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety red petals and a yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tanarius tamianus is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
