                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. albinigrescens</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. albinigrescens, commonly known as the wild rye or albinigrescens rye, is a variant of wild rye native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pale, often bluish-gray glumes and awns, which set it apart from other wheat species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, and it is an annual grass with a robust root system. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in certain environments.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation.</p>
