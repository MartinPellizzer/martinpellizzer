<p>Thelypteris heterocarpos, commonly known as the heterocarp fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across its native range in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Thelypteris heterocarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
