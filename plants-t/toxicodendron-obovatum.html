<p>Toxicodendron obovatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, obovate shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Toxicodendron obovatum contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause skin rashes and allergic reactions in many people.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
