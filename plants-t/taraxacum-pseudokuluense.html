<p>Taraxacum pseudokuluense, commonly known as the Kulu dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the genus Taraxacum, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
