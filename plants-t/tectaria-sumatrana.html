                    <h1>Tectaria sumatrana</h1>
<p>Tectaria sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name.</p>
