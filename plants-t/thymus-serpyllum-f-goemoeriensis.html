<p>Thymus serpyllum f. goemoeriensis, commonly known as the Goem√∂ri's thyme, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pinkish to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and sometimes endangered species.</p>
