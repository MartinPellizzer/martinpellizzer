                    <h1>Tillandsia morreniana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia morreniana, commonly known as the Morren's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can be either red, yellow, or orange in color.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
