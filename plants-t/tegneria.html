                    <h1>Tegneria</h1>
<p>Tegneria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Tegneria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
