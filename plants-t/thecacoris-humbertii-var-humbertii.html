                    <h1>Thecacoris humbertii var. humbertii</h1>
<p>Thecacoris humbertii var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's thorn, is a rare and striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that appear during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
