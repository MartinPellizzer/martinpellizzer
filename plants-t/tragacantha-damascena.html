                    <h1>Tragacantha damascena</h1>
<p>Tragacantha damascena, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a food thickener. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various insects and birds in its native environment.</p>
