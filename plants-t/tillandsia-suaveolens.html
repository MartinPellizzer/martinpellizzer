                    <h1>Tillandsia suaveolens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that emit a mild, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to grow without soil makes it an interesting subject for both botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
