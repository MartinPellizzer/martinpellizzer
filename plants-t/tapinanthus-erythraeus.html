                    <h1>Tapinanthus erythraeus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus erythraeus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or parasitic nightshade, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, aromatic scent. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
