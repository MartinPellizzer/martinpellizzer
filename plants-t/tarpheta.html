                    <h1>Tarpheta</h1>
<p>Tarpheta, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It consists of about 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Many species produce bright red or yellow flowers, which are often visited by birds and insects.</p>
<p>The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's propagation in its native habitats.</p>
