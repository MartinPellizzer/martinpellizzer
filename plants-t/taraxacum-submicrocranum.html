                    <h1>Taraxacum submicrocranum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum submicrocranum, commonly known as the miniature dandelion, is a small flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its tiny, delicate leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces a short, weak stem with a single flower head, which develops into a small, pale puffball-like seed capsule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Taraxacum.</p>
