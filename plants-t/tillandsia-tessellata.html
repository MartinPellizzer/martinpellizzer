                    <h1>Tillandsia tessellata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tessellata, commonly known as the mosaic air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Tillandsia tessellata is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
