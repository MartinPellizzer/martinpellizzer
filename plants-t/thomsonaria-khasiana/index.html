                            <h1>Thomsonaria Khasiana</h1>
<p>Khasi thornapple, scientifically known as Thomsonaria khasiana, is a unique and rare plant native to the northeastern region of India. This species belongs to the family Solanaceae, commonly known as the nightshade family, which includes many economically important plants. Despite its common name, the Khasi thornapple is not a true apple but is named for its thorny stems and fruit-bearing nature. It thrives in the moist, shaded environments of the Khasi Hills, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited awareness, this plant is becoming increasingly endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
