                    <h1>Tephrocactus floccosus var. ovoides</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus floccosus var. ovoides, commonly known as the woolly ball cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear clusters of white, fluffy spines. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
