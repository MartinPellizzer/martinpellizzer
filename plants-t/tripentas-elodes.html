<p>Tripentas elodes, commonly known as waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has long, slender, branching stems that are often coated in a fine layer of mucus. Its small, dark green leaves are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and they are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, though they can occasionally emerge near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Tripentas elodes plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
