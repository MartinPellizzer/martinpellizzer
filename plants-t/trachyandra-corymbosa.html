<p>Trachyandra corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bristleplant, is a member of the Asphodelaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale green flowers. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its environment.</p>
<p>Trachyandra corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes.</p>
