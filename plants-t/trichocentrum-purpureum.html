<p>Trichocentrum purpureum, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blooms. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a contrast to the vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum purpureum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
