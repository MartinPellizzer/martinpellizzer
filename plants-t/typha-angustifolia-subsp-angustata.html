                    <h1>Typha angustifolia subsp. angustata</h1>
<p>Typha angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, brownish flowers that form dense, spike-like clusters, which are important for seed dispersal. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
