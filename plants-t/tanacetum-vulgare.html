                    <h1>Tanacetum vulgare</h1>
<p>Tanacetum vulgare, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, button-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains compounds such as thujone and parthenolide, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
