<p>Tragacantha rauwolfii, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus rauwolfii, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used for centuries in medicine and as a food additive. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
