                    <h1>Tsuga roezlii</h1>
<p>Tsuga roezlii, commonly known as the RÃ¶tzli's hemlock, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain winged seeds, typical of many conifer species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
