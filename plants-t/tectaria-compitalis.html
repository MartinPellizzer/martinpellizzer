<p>Tectaria compitalis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
