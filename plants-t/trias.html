                    <h1>Trias</h1>
<p>Trias, commonly known as the Triassic period, is a geological time span rather than a plant.</p>
<p>However, the term may be confused with the Trias, a type of plant from the Triassic era. These plants were part of the early flora that thrived during the recovery of life after the Permian-Triassic extinction event. They included various gymnosperms and early seed plants that contributed to the development of terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Trias played a significant role in shaping the botanical landscape of the Mesozoic era.</p>
