                    <h1>Tillandsia reclinata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia reclinata, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia reclinata is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
