                    <h1>Trymalium billardierei var. litorale</h1>
<p>Trymalium billardierei var. litorale, commonly known as the coastal lichenwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are leathery and often covered in a fine layer of lichen, which contributes to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
