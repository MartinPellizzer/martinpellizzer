<p>Taraxacum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on serpentine rock outcrops. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds with white, feathery pappi.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its specialized habitat requirements and role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
