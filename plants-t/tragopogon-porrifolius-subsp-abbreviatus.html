<p>Tragopogon porrifolius subsp.</p>
<p>abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a composite flower head.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy, with seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
