<p>Trichocereus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarije√±a cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and spiny areoles.

<p>Trichocereus tarijensis is also known for its potential psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline.</p>
