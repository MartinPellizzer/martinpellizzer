                    <h1>Triticum loliaceum</h1>
<p>Triticum loliaceum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open habitats.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it plays a role in ecological systems and is sometimes used in botanical studies.</p>
