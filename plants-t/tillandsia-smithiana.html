                    <h1>Tillandsia smithiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its foliage forms a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure that collects rainwater.</p>
<p>Tillandsia smithiana is admired for its striking, often colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
