                    <h1>Tectaria macrodus</h1>
<p>Tectaria macrodus, commonly known as the giant tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
