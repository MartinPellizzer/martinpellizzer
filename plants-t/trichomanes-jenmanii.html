<p>Trichomanes jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's maidenhair, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, crescent-shaped clusters called sorus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes jenmanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
