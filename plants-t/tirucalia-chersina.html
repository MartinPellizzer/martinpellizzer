                    <h1>Tirucalia chersina</h1>
<p>Tirucalia chersina, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain three seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
