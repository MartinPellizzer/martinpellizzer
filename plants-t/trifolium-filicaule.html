                    <h1>Trifolium filicaule</h1>
<p>Trifolium filicaule, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trifolium filicaule is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
