                    <h1>Tillandsia turneri var. patens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia turneri var. patens, commonly known as the Silver Vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
