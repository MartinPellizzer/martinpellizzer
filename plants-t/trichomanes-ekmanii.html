                    <h1>Trichomanes ekmanii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks near streams and waterfalls. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
