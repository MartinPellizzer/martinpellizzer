                    <h1>Triptilion gibbosum</h1>
<p>Triptilion gibbosum, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture and protect against desiccation. The plant has short, upright stems with leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It is often found in rocky crevices or on the soil surface in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Triptilion gibbosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
