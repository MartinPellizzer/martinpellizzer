                    <h1>Thelypteris × pseudoliukiuensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × pseudoliukiuensis, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris kunthii* and *Thelypteris liukiuensis*.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, although it does not produce viable seeds.</p>
