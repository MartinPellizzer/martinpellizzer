                    <h1>Trophis nubium</h1>
<p>Trophis nubium, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests. The plant features finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Trophis nubium is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
