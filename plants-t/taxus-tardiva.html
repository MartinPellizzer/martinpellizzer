                    <h1>Taxus tardiva</h1>
<p>Taxus tardiva, commonly known as the late-flowering yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Taxus tardiva is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
