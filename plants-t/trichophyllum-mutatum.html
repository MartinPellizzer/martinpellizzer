                    <h1>Trichophyllum mutatum</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum mutatum, commonly known as the velvet cup, is a small, perennial fungus that belongs to the family Thelephoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown cap that often has a velvety texture, and its stem is typically shorter than the cap. The fruiting bodies usually appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. It is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Europe.</p>
<p>While not edible, it plays a role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
