                    <h1>Tectaria zippelii</h1>
<p>Tectaria zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, adapting well to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
