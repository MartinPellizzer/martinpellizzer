                    <h1>Toddalia tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Toddalia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional craftsmanship. The plant features simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range.</p>
