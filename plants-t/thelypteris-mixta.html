<p>Thelypteris mixta, commonly known as the mixed shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris mixta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
