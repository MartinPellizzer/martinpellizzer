<p>Thelypteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris alpina is well adapted to cold, harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
