<p>Trapa europaea var. egregia, commonly known as the European water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that mature underwater. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The fruits, which are edible when young, are often harvested for their nutty flavor and nutritional value.</p>
