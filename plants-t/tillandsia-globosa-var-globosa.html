                    <h1>Tillandsia globosa var. globosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia globosa var. globosa, commonly known as the globular air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, globe-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
