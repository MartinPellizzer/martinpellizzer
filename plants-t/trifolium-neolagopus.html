                    <h1>Trifolium neolagopus</h1>
<p>Trifolium neolagopus, commonly known as the alpine mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in alpine gardens and for erosion control in rocky landscapes.</p>
