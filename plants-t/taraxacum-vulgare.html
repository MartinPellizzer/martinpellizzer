                    <h1>Taraxacum vulgare</h1>
<p>Taraxacum vulgare, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After blooming, the plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which allows the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>This plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed, though it has historical uses in medicine and cuisine.</p>
