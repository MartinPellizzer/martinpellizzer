                    <h1>Themistoclesia unduavensis</h1>
<p>Themistoclesia unduavensis, commonly known as the unduavensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
