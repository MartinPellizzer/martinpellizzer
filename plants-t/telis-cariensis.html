<p>Telis cariensis, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that resemble a star when fully unfurled. The plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and slow growth rate make it a sought-after ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
