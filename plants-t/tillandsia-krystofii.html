                    <h1>Tillandsia krystofii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia krystofii, commonly known as the Krystof's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments.</p>
