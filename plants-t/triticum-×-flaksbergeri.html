                    <h1>Triticum × flaksbergeri</h1>
<p>Triticum × flaksbergeri, commonly known as the flaksbergeri rye, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between common rye (Secale cereale) and wheat (Triticum spp.).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant typically exhibits tall, slender stems with long, narrow leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant hybridization and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
