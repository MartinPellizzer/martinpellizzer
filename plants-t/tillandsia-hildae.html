                    <h1>Tillandsia hildae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hildae, commonly known as the Hilde's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
