                    <h1>Taxus umbraculifera var. hicksii</h1>
<p>Taxus umbraculifera var. hicksii, commonly known as the Hicks' yew, is a rare and endangered variant of the yew tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, a feature shared with other yew species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
