<p>Trichipteris demissa, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Trichipteris demissa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
