                    <h1>Trifolium monanthum var. parvum</h1>
<p>Trifolium monanthum var. parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
