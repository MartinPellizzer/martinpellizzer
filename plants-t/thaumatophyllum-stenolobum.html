                    <h1>Thaumatophyllum stenolobum</h1>
<p>Thaumatophyllum stenolobum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
