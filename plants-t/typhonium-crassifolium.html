<p>Typhonium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
