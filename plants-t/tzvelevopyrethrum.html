<p>Tzvelevopyrethrum, commonly known as the goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>

Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments.</p>
<p>Tzvelevopyrethrum is valued for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory compounds, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
