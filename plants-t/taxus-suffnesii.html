                    <h1>Taxus suffnesii</h1>
<p>Taxus suffnesii, commonly known as the Himalayan yew, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth, evergreen foliage, and the presence of toxic, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are dispersed by birds. Taxus suffnesii is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the compound taxol, which is used in cancer treatments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
