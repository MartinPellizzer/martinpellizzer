<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Tetrapasma juncea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
