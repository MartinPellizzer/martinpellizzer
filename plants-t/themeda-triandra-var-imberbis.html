<p>Themeda triandra var. imberbis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blady grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
