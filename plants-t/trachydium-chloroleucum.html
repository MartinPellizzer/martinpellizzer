<p>Trachydium chloroleucum, commonly known as the white-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. It is native to regions with dry, sandy soils, such as parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Trachydium chloroleucum is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
