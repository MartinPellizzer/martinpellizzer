<p>Thisantha decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Thisantha decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
