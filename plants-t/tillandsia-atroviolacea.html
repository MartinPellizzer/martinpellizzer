The plant does not require soil, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves via trichomes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
