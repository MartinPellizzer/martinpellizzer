                    <h1>Tillandsia grisea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia grisea, commonly known as the gray tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia grisea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
