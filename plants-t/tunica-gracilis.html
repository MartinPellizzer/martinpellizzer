                    <h1>Tunica gracilis</h1>
<p>Tunica gracilis, commonly known as the slender tunica, is a specialized plant structure found in certain fungal species.</p>
<p>It is a thin, membranous layer that forms part of the fungal fruiting body. This layer is composed primarily of hyphae and provides structural support. The tunica gracilis plays a role in protecting the developing spores within the fruiting body.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its contribution to the morphology and reproductive success of the fungus.</p>
