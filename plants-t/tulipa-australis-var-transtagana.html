                    <h1>Tulipa australis var. transtagana</h1>
<p>Tulipa australis var. transtagana, commonly known as the Trans-Tasman tulip, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to the southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting purple or black blotch at the base. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring, preceding the blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
