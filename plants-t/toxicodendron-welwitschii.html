<p>It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by accessing groundwater. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The Welwitschia is also known for its ability to produce a toxic resin, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
