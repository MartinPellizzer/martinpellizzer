                    <h1>Tillandsia cochabambae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cochabambae, commonly known as the Cochabamba airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
