                    <h1>Tillandsia dependens f. percordobensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dependens f. percordobensis, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin leaves that form a rosette, which helps it capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
