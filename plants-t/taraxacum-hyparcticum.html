                    <h1>Taraxacum hyparcticum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hyparcticum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hyparcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations in its harsh habitat.</p>
