                    <h1>Tococa subnuda</h1>
<p>Tococa subnuda, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring palmate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated pods containing bitter seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a wild relative of cultivated cocoa, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, it is less studied compared to its more commercially important relatives.</p>
