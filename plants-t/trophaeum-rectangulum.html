                    <h1>Trophaeum rectangulum</h1>
<p>Trophaeum rectangulum, commonly known as the rectangular lichen, is a unique species of lichen characterized by its distinct, geometric growth pattern.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like structure that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its rectangular shape is a result of the way the fungal hyphae grow and interlock.</p>
<p>This plant plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
