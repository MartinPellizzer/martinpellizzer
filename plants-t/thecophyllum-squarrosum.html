<p>Thecophyllum squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga and a fungus, which together enable it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role.</p>
<p>Thecophyllum squarrosum is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
