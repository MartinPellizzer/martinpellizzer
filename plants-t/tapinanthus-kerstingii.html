                    <h1>Tapinanthus kerstingii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus kerstingii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
