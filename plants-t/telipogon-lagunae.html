<p>Telipogon lagunae, commonly known as the Lake Islands lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the remote Lake Islands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Iridaceae family, characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon lagunae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
