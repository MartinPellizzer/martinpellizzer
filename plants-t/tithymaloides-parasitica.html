                    <h1>Tithymaloides parasitica</h1>
<p>Tithymaloides parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic tithymaloid, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is found in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
