<p>Thuja gigantea var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese Noble Fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan.</p>

The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
