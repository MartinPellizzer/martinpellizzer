                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. anatolicum</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian dwarf wheat, is a small-grained wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to common wheat. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, glaucous leaves. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in such conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it of interest for both agricultural research and potential use in breeding programs.</p>
