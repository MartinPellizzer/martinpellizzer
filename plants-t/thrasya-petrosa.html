                    <h1>Thrasya petrosa</h1>
<p>Thrasya petrosa, commonly known as the rock thrift, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to protect against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Thrasya petrosa is often found growing on rocky slopes and in coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
