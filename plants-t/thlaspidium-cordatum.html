<p>Thlaspidium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a distinctive feature in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Thlaspidium cordatum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
