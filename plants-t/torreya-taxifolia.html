                    <h1>Torreya taxifolia</h1>
<p>Torreya taxifolia, commonly known as the Japanese torreya, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Japan and southern Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, round cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in the wild.</p>
