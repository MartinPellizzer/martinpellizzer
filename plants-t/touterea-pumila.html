                    <h1>Touterea pumila</h1>
<p>Touterea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant grows slowly and can reach a height of up to 2 meters, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its rhizome is fibrous and can be used in traditional practices, while its fronds provide shade and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Overall, Touterea pumila is a unique and relatively low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
