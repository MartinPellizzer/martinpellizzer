                    <h1>Taraxacum salsum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum salsum, commonly known as the saltwort dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. Its ability to thrive in salty soils makes it an important pioneer species in saline habitats.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
