<p>Thelypteris subnigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that often appear almost black when dry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its survival in low-light habitats.</p>
