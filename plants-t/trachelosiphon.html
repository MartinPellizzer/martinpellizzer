<p>Trachelosiphon, commonly known as the green alga, is a genus of freshwater green algae belonging to the order Ulvales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells arranged in unbranched filaments that can form dense mats on the surface of water. The thallus is typically flat and ribbon-like, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Trachelosiphon species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
