                    <h1>Taeniophyllum nephrophorum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum nephrophorum, commonly known as the kidney-leaf stiltroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are ovate to kidney-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and are arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
