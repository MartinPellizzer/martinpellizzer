<p>Trichipteris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat.</p>
<p>Trichipteris cordata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
