                    <h1>Taraxacum amabile</h1>
<p>Taraxacum amabile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It produces a distinctive seed head known as a "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes.</p>
<p>This plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed, though it has medicinal and ecological significance.</p>
