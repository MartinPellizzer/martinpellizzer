                            <h1>Tragacantha Lyallii</h1>
<p>Lyall's tragacanth, scientifically known as Tragacantha lyallii, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. This species belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and distinctive foliage. Despite its ornamental appeal, it remains poorly studied due to its limited distribution and challenging growing conditions. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from habitat loss and over-collection. Its existence highlights the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems and the need for continued botanical research.</p>
