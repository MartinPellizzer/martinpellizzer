<p>Tragopogon porrifolius subsp.</p>
<p>sativus, commonly known as the cultivated thistle or garden thistle, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-haired, spiny leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and is also cultivated for its edible leaves, which are tender and mild in flavor. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is widely used in gardens and can naturalize in suitable climates.</p>
