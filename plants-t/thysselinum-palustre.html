<p>Thysselinum palustre, commonly known as the marsh thyselinum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. The plant has delicate, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the early spring. Its flowering stems are often reddish in color and can reach heights of up to 20 centimeters.</p>
<p>Thysselinum palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
