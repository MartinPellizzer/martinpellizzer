                    <h1>Thymus vulgaris var. capitellatus</h1>
<p>Thymus vulgaris var. capitellatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrower than those of common thyme, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small purple or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol, making it valuable in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
