                    <h1>Tillandsia macrodactylon</h1>
<p>Tillandsia macrodactylon, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with purple or pink flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>
