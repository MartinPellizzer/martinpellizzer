<p>Tillandsia pseudobaileyi subsp.</p>
<p>pseudobaileyi, commonly known as the pseudobailey's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
