                    <h1>Tromlyca</h1>
<p>Tromlyca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Tromlyca is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Tromlyca is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
