                    <h1>Taxus cuspidata var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Taxus cuspidata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Japanese yew or dwarf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features a compact, dense form with dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter than those of other yew species. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its upright growth habit and year-round foliage.</p>
