                    <h1>Trifolium elizabethiae</h1>
<p>Trifolium elizabethiae, commonly known as Elizabeth's clover, is a rare and endemic species of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in early spring. Native to a specific region in the western United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trifolium elizabethiae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
