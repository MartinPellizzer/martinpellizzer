                            <h1>Toxicodendron Hypoleucum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron hypoleucum is a lesser-known member of the Anacardiaceae family, native to parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is known for its potent irritant properties, particularly due to the urushiol oil it contains. Exposure to its leaves or sap can cause severe skin reactions, including redness, itching, and blistering. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine. Understanding its characteristics is essential for both ecological studies and human safety.</p>
