<p>Tragacantha incurva, commonly known as the sickle-fronded tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often curved or sickle-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, umbrella-like seed heads. Its latex sap, which is thick and sticky, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent.</p>
<p>Tragacantha incurva thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
