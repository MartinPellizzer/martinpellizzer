                    <h1>Typhonium reflexum</h1>
<p>Typhonium reflexum, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
