                    <h1>Thyrsacanthus amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Thyrsacanthus amplexicaulis, commonly known as the starburst cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
