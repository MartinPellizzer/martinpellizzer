                    <h1>Trigonella coerulescens f. obscura</h1>
<p>Trigonella coerulescens f. obscura, commonly known as the dark-blue fenugreek, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the fenugreek plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark blue flowers and compact growth habit, distinguishing it from the more common yellow-flowered forms. This subspecies is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a short, branched stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
