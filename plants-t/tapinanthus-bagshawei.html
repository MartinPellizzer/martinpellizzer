                    <h1>Tapinanthus bagshawei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus bagshawei, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and usually heart-shaped, while its roots can penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions within its native habitat.</p>
