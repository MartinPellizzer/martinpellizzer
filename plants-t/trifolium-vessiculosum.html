                <h1>Trifolium vessiculosum</h1>
<p>Trifolium vessiculosum, commonly known as the bladder clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive bladdery texture due to the presence of air-filled cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Trifolium vessiculosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
