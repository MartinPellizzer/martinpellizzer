<p>Taraxacum mitalii, commonly known as the Mitali dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow-orange flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal.
