                    <h1>Timonius epiphyticus</h1>
<p>Timonius epiphyticus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's striking white flowers resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and nutrient-rich mist.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and declining natural populations, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
