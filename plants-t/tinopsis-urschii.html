                    <h1>Tinopsis urschii</h1>
<p>Tinopsis urschii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Tinopsis urschii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
