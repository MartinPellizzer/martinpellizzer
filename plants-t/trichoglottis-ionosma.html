<p>Trichoglottis ionosma, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Trichoglottis ionosma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements.</p>
