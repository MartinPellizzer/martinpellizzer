                    <h1>Themelium loherianum</h1>
<p>Themelium loherianum, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungal partner, allowing it to colonize nutrient-poor substrates. Its growth pattern is slow, often forming dense mats on rocks, bark, or soil.</p>
<p>Themelium loherianum plays a crucial role in ecological succession by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
