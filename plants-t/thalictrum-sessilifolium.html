                    <h1>Thalictrum sessilifolium</h1>
<p>Thalictrum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessileleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
