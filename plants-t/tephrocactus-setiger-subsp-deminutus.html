<p>Tephrocactus setiger subsp.</p>
<p>deminutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a rare and compact cactus species native to parts of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often reduced to spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
