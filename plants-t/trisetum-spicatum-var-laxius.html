                    <h1>Trisetum spicatum var. laxius</h1>
<p>Trisetum spicatum var. laxius, commonly known as the loose spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spike-like inflorescences that are somewhat loose compared to the more compact spikes of the typical variety. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early to mid-summer.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
