                    <h1>Tillaeastrum latifolium</h1>
<p>Tillaeastrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and can help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas due to its rapid spread and ecological impact.</p>
