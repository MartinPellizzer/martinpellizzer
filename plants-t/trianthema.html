                    <h1>Trianthema</h1>
<p>Trianthema, commonly known as the "bitter bush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their water-storing tissues. Trianthema species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance.</p>
