                    <h1>Thesium maritimum</h1>
<p>Thesium maritimum, commonly known as the sea thesium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features wiry stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Thesium maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
