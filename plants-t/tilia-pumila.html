                    <h1>Tilia pumila</h1>
<p>Tilia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf linden or Siberian linden, is a small, deciduous tree native to the colder regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded crown, smooth gray bark, and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>The wood of Tilia pumila is soft and lightweight, historically used for crafting items such as furniture and musical instruments.</p>
