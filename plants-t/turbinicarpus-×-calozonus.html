                    <h1>Turbinicarpus × calozonus</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus × calozonus, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus platycarpus and Turbinicarpus leucopetiolatus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant features a unique coloration, often with a contrasting color between the body and the crown, which is a result of its hybrid nature. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>The hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in cactus gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
