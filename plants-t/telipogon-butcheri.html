<p>Telipogon butcheri, commonly known as the Butcher's telipogon, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and lacks the typical showy flowers of many orchids. This plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to grow in cold, alpine environments. It has a short, creeping stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
