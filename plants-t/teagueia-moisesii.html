                    <h1>Teagueia moisesii</h1>
<p>Teagueia moisesii, commonly known as the Moises' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Teagueia moisesii is considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
