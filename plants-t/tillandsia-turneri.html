                    <h1>Tillandsia turneri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia turneri, commonly known as the silver air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
