<p>Tsuga canadensis var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The foliage is dense and dark green, with scale-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical eastern hemlock. It produces small cones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is also notable for its resilience to environmental stressors and its role in maintaining biodiversity in shaded habitats.</p>
