                    <h1>Tillandsia lagunaensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lagunaensis, commonly known as the Laguna Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
