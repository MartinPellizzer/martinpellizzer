                    <h1>Taraxacum uncatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum uncatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, upright stem, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
