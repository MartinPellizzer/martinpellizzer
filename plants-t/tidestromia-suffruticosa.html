<p>Tidestromia suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its woody stems and dense growth habit help stabilize dune environments.</p>
<p>Tidestromia suffruticosa plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and preventing erosion in coastal areas.</p>
