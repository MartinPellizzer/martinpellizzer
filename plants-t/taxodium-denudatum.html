                    <h1>Taxodium denudatum</h1>
<p>Taxodium denudatum, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct exfoliating bark that peels in papery strips, revealing a mottled, reddish-brown inner layer. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the fall, and its needle-like leaves turn bright red before falling in autumn. It thrives in wetland environments, often forming dense stands in swampy areas.</p>
<p>The bald cypress is also notable for its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
