                    <h1>Tillandsia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and have a waxy coating to reduce evaporation.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
