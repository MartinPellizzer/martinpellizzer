                <h1>Triticum palaeocolchicum</h1>
<p>Triticum palaeocolchicum, commonly known as the ancient wheat, is a rare and extinct species of grass native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, glumeless spikelets and small, elliptical grains. The plant's genome has been studied for its potential genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat. Due to its historical significance, it is of interest to researchers in plant genetics and archaeobotany.</p>
<p>However, it is no longer found in the wild, making it a subject of conservation and restoration efforts.</p>
