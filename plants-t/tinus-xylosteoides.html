<p>Tinus xylosteoides, commonly known as the African sandflea plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Tinus xylosteoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
