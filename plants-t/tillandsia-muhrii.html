                    <h1>Tillandsia muhrii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia muhrii, commonly known as the Muhrii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or pink flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia muhrii is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight.</p>
