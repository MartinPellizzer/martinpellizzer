                    <h1>Tectaria orbicularis</h1>
<p>Tectaria orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, orbicular (rounded) fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
<p>Tectaria orbicularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
