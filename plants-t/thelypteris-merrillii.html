<p>Thelypteris merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while also facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Thelypteris merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
