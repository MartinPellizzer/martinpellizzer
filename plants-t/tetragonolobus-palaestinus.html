The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
