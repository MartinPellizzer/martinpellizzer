                    <h1>Tragacantha physocalyx</h1>
<p>Tragacantha physocalyx, commonly known as the Persian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic gum resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and has been used historically in various medicinal and industrial applications.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well adapted to regions with limited rainfall.</p>
