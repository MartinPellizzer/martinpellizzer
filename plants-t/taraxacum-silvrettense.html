                    <h1>Taraxacum silvrettense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum silvrettense, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flowering head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
