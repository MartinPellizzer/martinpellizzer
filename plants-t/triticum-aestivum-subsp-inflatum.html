                    <h1>Triticum aestivum subsp. inflatum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum subsp.</p>
<p>inflatum, commonly known as inflated wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique seed structure. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of inflated, balloon-like glumes that enclose the grains, a trait not commonly found in other wheat species.</p>
<p>This morphological feature is believed to aid in seed dispersal and protection. It is primarily found in specific regions of Central Asia, where it grows in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its agricultural potential, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited yield and adaptability compared to common wheat varieties.</p>
