                    <h1>Triphelia brunioides</h1>
<p>Triphelia brunioides, commonly known as the silver leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
