                    <h1>Tillandsia sucrei</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sucrei, commonly known as the Sucre's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sucrei is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
