                    <h1>Tillandsia tuberosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
