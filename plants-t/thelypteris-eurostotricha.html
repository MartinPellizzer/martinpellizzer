<p>Thelypteris eurostotricha, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet forests. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially buried, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Thelypteris eurostotricha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
