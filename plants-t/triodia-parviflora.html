                    <h1>Triodia parviflora</h1>
<p>Triodia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered spinifex, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit that forms a low-lying mat. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in spinifex grasslands and is an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
