                    <h1>Taxodium distichum var. typica</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum var. typica, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, scale-like leaves that turn a striking reddish-brown in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick, scaly, and becomes deeply furrowed with age.</p>
<p>The bald cypress is often found in wetland habitats, where its roots form a network of pneumatophores to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil.</p>
