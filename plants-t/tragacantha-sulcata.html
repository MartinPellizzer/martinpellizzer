                    <h1>Tragacantha sulcata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha sulcata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha sulcata is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
