<p>Tomophyllum callophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tomophyllum callophyllum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
