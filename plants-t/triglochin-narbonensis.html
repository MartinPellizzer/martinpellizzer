<p>Triglochin narbonensis, commonly known as the Narbonne's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and damp meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Triglochin narbonensis is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in areas with poor drainage.</p>
