                    <h1>Tetraphylloides</h1>
<p>Tetraphylloides, commonly known as the broad liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Fasciolidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leaf-shaped body and a complex life cycle involving intermediate hosts such as snails and freshwater crustaceans. The adult flukes reside in the bile ducts of the liver of their definitive hosts, which include various mammals, including humans. The plant-like appearance of the fluke's body is a key feature in its classification within the class Trematoda.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is not a plant but a helminth, and its study is important in parasitology and public health.</p>
