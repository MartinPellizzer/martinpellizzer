                    <h1>Tovaria tatsienensis</h1>
<p>Tovaria tatsienensis, commonly known as the Yunnan evergreen fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tovariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forests at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Tovaria tatsienensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
