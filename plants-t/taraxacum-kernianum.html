                    <h1>Taraxacum kernianum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum kernianum, commonly known as the Kern's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, hairless stem topped with a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Taraxacum kernianum is often mistaken for common dandelions but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
