<p>Triticum boeoticum subsp.</p>
<p>uruartu, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched inflorescence and awned lemmas, typical of many wheat species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its genome contains a complex structure, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through breeding programs.</p>
