                    <h1>Taxanthema echioides</h1>
<p>Taxanthema echioides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Taxanthema echioides is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
