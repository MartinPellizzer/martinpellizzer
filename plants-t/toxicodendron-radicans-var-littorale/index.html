                            <h1>Toxicodendron Radicans Var. Littorale</h1>
<p>Poison ivy, scientifically known as Toxicodendron radicans var. littorale, is a highly allergenic plant commonly found in wooded areas across North America. It is infamous for its ability to cause severe skin irritation through contact with its oily resin, urushiol. This variant of poison ivy thrives in moist, coastal environments, distinguishing it from other forms of the species. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and animals. Its presence serves as a reminder of the dangers lurking in seemingly innocuous natural settings.</p>
