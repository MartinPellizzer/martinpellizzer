<p>Tillandsia andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia andrieuxii is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
