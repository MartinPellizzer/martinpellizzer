<p>Tapeinosperma koghiense, commonly known as the Koghi desert date, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by the development of woody, elongated fruits. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tapeinosperma koghiense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
