                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. rigidiformis</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. rigidiformis, commonly known as rigid leaf thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, aromatic foliage with narrow, upright leaves that are often more rigid than those of the typical thymus serpyllum. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and use as a culinary herb.</p>
