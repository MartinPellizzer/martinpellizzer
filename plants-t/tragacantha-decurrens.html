                    <h1>Tragacantha decurrens</h1>
<p>Tragacantha decurrens, commonly known as the Persian gum plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a yellowish resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep roots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Tragacantha decurrens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for wildlife.</p>
