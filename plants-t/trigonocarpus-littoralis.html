<p>Trigonocarpus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are woody pods containing seeds that are dispersed by water, adapting it to its saline coastal environment.</p>
<p>Trigonocarpus littoralis is often found in mangrove ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
