                    <h1>Telipogon bombiformis</h1>
<p>Telipogon bombiformis, commonly known as the balloon orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant is characterized by its unique, inflated, balloon-like flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, swollen shape that resembles a balloon, hence its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
