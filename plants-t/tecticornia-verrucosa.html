<p>Tecticornia verrucosa, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, mat-like clusters, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, appearing in spikes during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Tecticornia verrucosa is well adapted to harsh environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
