                    <h1>Trichomanes daguense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes daguense, commonly known as the Daguense water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes daguense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
