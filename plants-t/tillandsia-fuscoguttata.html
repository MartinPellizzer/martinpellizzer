                    <h1>Tillandsia fuscoguttata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fuscoguttata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
