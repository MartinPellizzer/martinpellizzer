                    <h1>Triticum salinum</h1>
<p>Triticum salinum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline soils where many other plants cannot survive. The plant typically grows in dense mats or tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence contains both male and female flowers, making it monoecious.</p>
<p>Triticum salinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments.</p>
