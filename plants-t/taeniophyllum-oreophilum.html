                    <h1>Taeniophyllum oreophilum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum oreophilum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in montane rainforests where high humidity and indirect light are prevalent.</p>
