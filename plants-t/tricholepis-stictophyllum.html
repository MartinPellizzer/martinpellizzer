<p>Tricholepis stictophyllum, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as grasses and forbs, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its small, scale-like leaves are reduced, and it produces yellow or orange flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
