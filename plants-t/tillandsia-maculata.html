                    <h1>Tillandsia maculata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia maculata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance, with white and green striped leaves, makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
