<p>Touterea multicaulis, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Despite its hardiness, Touterea multicaulis is considered rare and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
