<p>Thelypteris grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in place.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape that gives the plant its common name.</p>
