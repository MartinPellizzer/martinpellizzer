                    <h1>Thalesia sedii</h1>
<p>Thalesia sedii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily in the wind. Thalesia sedii has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
