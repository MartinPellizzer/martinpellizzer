<p>Tulipa agenensis subsp.</p>
<p>sharonensis, commonly known as Sharon's tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Israel. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a distinctive black eye.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous structures that store nutrients for the next growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
