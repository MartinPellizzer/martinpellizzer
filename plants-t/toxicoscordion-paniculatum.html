                    <h1>Toxicoscordion paniculatum</h1>
<p>Toxicoscordion paniculatum, commonly known as the western gourd or false cucumber, is a member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive yellowish-green spadices that resemble a cucumber. It is highly toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause severe irritation and swelling upon contact or ingestion.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution.</p>
