<p>Trifolium angustifolium subsp.</p>
<p>purpureum, commonly known as purple clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
