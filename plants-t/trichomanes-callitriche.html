<p>Trichomanes callitriche, commonly known as the water hawksbeard, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near streams, ponds, or wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Trichomanes callitriche plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities.</p>
