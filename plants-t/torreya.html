                    <h1>Torreya</h1>
<p>Torreya, commonly known as the torreya tree or mountain cedar, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees native to eastern Asia and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain a single seed. Torreya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species are now considered endangered.</p>
