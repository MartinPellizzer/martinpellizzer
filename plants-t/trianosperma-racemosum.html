<p>Trianosperma racemosum, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Trianosperma racemosum is often found in sandy soils and is used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
