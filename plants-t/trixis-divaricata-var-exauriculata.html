The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to drought include succulent-like leaves and deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
