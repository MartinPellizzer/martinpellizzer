<p>Trifolium squamosum subsp.</p>
<p>xatardii, commonly known as the Xatard clover, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
