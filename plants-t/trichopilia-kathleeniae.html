                    <h1>Trichopilia kathleeniae</h1>
<p>Trichopilia kathleeniae, commonly known as the Kathleen's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters of three to five. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, underground rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is closely associated with specific host trees for its mycorrhizal relationships.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
