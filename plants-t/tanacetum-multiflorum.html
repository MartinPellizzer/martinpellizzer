                    <h1>Tanacetum multiflorum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum multiflorum, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, aromatic scent. Tansy is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to livestock.</p>
