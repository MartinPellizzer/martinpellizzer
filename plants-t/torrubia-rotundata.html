                    <h1>Torrubia rotundata</h1>
<p>Torrubia rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved torrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
