                    <h1>Tillandsia australis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia australis, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
