                    <h1>Tillandsia tillii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tillii, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are typically white or yellow, emerge from the center of the rosette and bloom briefly before the plant produces offsets.</p>
