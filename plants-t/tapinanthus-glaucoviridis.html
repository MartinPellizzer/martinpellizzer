                    <h1>Tapinanthus glaucoviridis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus glaucoviridis, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically a dull green to bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
