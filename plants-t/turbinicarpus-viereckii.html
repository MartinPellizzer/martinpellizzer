                    <h1>Turbinicarpus viereckii</h1>
<p>Turbinicarpus viereckii, commonly known as the Vireckâ€™s turbinaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem and is typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are relatively small but numerous.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
