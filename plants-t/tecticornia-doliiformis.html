                    <h1>Tecticornia doliiformis</h1>
<p>Tecticornia doliiformis, commonly known as the globe-shaped grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tecticornia doliiformis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
