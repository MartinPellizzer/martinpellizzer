<p>Thelypteris filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>

Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris filix-mas is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
