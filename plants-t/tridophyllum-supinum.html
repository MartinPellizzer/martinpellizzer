                    <h1>Tridophyllum supinum</h1>
<p>Tridophyllum supinum, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using a limited amount of chlorophyll. Its small, scale-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. The plant's fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts.</p>
<p>Tridophyllum supinum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
