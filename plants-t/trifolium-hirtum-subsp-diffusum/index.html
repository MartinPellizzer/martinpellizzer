                            <h1>Trifolium Hirtum Subsp. Diffusum</h1>
<p>White clover, scientifically known as Trifolium hirtum subsp. diffusum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which often have a distinctive white or pale green coloration. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of sustainable agricultural systems. Despite its modest appearance, White clover plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and improving soil health.</p>
