                    <h1>Tellima bulbifera</h1>
<p>Tellima bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous tellima, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which serve as vegetative propagules and are used for reproduction. These bulbils are often found at the base of the plant or along the stems.</p>
<p>Tellima bulbifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
