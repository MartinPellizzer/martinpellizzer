<p>Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus var. schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz's turbinicarpus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and hardiness in dry conditions.</p>
