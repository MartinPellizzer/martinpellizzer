                    <h1>Taxillus heyneanus</h1>
<p>Taxillus heyneanus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
