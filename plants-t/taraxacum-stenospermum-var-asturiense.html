                    <h1>Taraxacum stenospermum var. asturiense</h1>
<p>Taraxacum stenospermum var. asturiense, commonly known as the Asturian narrow-sepal dandelion, is a rare variant of the dandelion species found primarily in the Asturias region of northern Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated sepals and smaller, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth margin and a prominent central vein.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
