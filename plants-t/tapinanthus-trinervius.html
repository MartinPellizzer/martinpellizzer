                    <h1>Tapinanthus trinervius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus trinervius, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found growing on trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally problematic in agricultural settings.</p>
