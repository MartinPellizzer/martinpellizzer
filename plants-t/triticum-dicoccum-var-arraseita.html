<p>Triticum dicoccum var. arraseita, commonly known as arraseita emmer wheat, is a variety of ancient wheat characterized by its hulled grains and robust growth habit.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, lanceolate leaves and compact spikelets that bear the grains. Its botanical features include a tough, fibrous hull that encases the grain, which is retained until threshing.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardiness and potential use in traditional and modern baking applications.</p>
