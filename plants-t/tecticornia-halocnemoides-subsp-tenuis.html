<p>Tecticornia halocnemoides subsp.</p>
<p>tenuis, commonly known as slender saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that helps it access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in saline soils and is an important component of stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
