<p>Thymus maroccanus var. rhombicus, commonly known as Moroccan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Morocco.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture and scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
