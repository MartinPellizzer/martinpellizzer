                    <h1>Trifolium procumbens var. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Trifolium procumbens var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the low-growing clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It is typically found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less floriferous than other clover species, hence its name "pauciflorum," meaning "few-flowered.".</p>
