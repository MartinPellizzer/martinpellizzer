                    <h1>Tragacantha subulifera</h1>
<p>Tragacantha subulifera, commonly known as the needleleaf tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Tragacantha subulifera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
