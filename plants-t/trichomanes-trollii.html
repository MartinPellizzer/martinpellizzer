<p>Trichomanes trollii, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Trichomanes trollii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
