                <h1>Triticum dicoccum</h1>
<p>Triticum dicoccum, commonly known as einkorn, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is a diploid wheat species with a genome size smaller than modern wheat varieties, contributing to its simpler genetic structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned glumes, and its grains are enclosed in tough, inedible hulls. Einkorn is characterized by its high protein content and nutrient density, making it a valuable crop for both historical and modern agricultural studies.</p>
<p>Its resilience to poor soil conditions and drought makes it a promising candidate for sustainable farming practices.</p>
