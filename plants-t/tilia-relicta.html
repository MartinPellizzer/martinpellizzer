<p>Tilia relicta, commonly known as the relic lime tree, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments. Its wood is dense and strong, historically valued for construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tilia relicta is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
