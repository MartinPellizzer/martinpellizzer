<p>Tectaria hosei, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus.</p>
