                    <h1>Taraxacum leonicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum leonicum, commonly known as the leopard's bane, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower head, which is surrounded by a pappus of bristly hairs that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, while its stem is hollow and ribbed.</p>
<p>The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
