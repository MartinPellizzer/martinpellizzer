                    <h1>Toxicodendron pumilum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf poison ivy, is a small shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval with a pointed tip and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by reddish or brownish berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided or controlled in natural areas to prevent harm to wildlife and people.</p>
