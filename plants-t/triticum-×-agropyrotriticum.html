                    <h1>Triticum × agropyrotriticum</h1>
<p>Triticum × agropyrotriticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelet-based inflorescence, with small, two-lobed glumes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. Its seeds are small and often have a hard coat, which aids in their survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat breeding programs.</p>
