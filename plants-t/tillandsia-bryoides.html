                    <h1>Tillandsia bryoides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bryoides, commonly known as the mossy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant has a dense, moss-like rosette of narrow, overlapping leaves that help it retain moisture from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in terrariums and indoor gardens.</p>
