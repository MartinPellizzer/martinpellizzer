                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. ilamicum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. ilamicum, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in dry, rocky soils across the Mediterranean region. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or green flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks, which make them difficult to process without specialized techniques.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
