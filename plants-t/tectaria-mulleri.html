<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
