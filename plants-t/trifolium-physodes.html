                    <h1>Trifolium physodes</h1>
<p>Trifolium physodes, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Trifolium physodes is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting subsequent plant growth.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a valuable species in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
