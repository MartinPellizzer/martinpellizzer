                    <h1>Tillandsia renateehlersiae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia renateehlersiae, commonly known as the Renate Ehlers Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>This species is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
