                    <h1>Taeniophyllum clementsii</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum clementsii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of specific host trees, such as the California black oak.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and minerals. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It plays a role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Taeniophyllum clementsii is an important component of the forest canopy in its native range.</p>
