                    <h1>Taxillus renii</h1>
<p>Taxillus renii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its life cycle involves the germination of its seeds on the bark of host trees, where they develop into a haustorium to penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Taxillus renii plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
