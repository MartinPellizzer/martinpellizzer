                    <h1>Thismia domei</h1>
<p>Thismia domei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are typically clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary organic compounds for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, Thismia domei is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
