<p>Triglochin protuberans, commonly known as the woolly spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Triglochin protuberans is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
