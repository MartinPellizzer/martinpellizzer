                    <h1>Tschudya</h1>
<p>Tschudya, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where they thrive in alpine and subalpine environments. Tschudya species are characterized by their hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. They are typically perennial and grow in rocky or sandy soils, often forming dense mats or low shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to their hardy nature, they are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value.</p>
