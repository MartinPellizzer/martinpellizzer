                    <h1>Tillandsia geminiflora var. incana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia geminiflora var. incana, commonly known as the white-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
