<p>Triodia bunglensis, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a common component of mallee and spinifex grasslands. Triodia bunglensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert fauna.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a significant plant in Australian ecosystems.</p>
