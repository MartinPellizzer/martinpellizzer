                    <h1>Thelycrania stolonifera</h1>
<p>Thelycrania stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Thelycrania stolonifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
