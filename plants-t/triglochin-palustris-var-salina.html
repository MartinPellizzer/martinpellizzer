                    <h1>Triglochin palustris var. salina</h1>
<p>Triglochin palustris var. salina, commonly known as salt marsh trigonella, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal marshes and tidal flats where soil salinity is high. The plant has succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common triglochin but exhibits greater tolerance to salt stress.</p>
