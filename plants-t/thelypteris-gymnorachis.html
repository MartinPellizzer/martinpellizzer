<p>Thelypteris gymnorachis, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a membranous indusium. Thelypteris gymnorachis prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distinctive foliage and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts.</p>
