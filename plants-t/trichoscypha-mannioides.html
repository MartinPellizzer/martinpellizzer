                    <h1>Trichoscypha mannioides</h1>
<p>Trichoscypha mannioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing three winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many parts of its range.</p>
