<p>Triodia viscida, commonly known as the silky triodia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs that cover its foliage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense covering of hair.</p>
<p>Triodia viscida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
