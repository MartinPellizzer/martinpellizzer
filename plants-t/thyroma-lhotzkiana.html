                    <h1>Thyroma lhotzkiana</h1>
<p>Thyroma lhotzkiana, commonly known as the Lhotskian bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Thyroma lhotzkiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
