                    <h1>Trifolium resupinatum var. resupinatum</h1>
<p>Trifolium resupinatum var. resupinatum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, with a distinctive white to pale pink flower head. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which helps it spread and colonize disturbed areas effectively.</p>
