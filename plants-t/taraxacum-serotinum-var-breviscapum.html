                    <h1>Taraxacum serotinum var. breviscapum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum serotinum var. breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves and a hairy, short stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and unique floral morphology compared to other dandelion species.</p>
