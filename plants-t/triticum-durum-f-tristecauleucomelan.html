                    <h1>Triticum durum f. tristecauleucomelan</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. tristecauleucomelan, commonly known as the dark-stemmed durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinct morphological features.</p>
<p>It exhibits a darker pigmentation in its stem and leaves compared to typical durum wheat varieties, which may be attributed to specific genetic factors. The plant is typically shorter and more compact, with a reduced stature that can influence its growth habit and yield potential. It is primarily cultivated in regions with cooler climates where its growth cycle aligns with seasonal conditions.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies for its unique traits and potential agricultural applications.</p>
