<p>Trichocereus cephalomacrostibas, commonly known as the "Cerro de Pasco cactus," is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, white to pale blue spines and a generally smooth, green stem. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, arid conditions. It produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
