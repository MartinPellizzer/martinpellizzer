<p>Taraxacum kodiakense, commonly known as the Kodiak dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Aleutian Islands and parts of Alaska.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-supported seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
