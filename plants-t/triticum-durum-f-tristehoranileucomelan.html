                    <h1>Triticum durum f. tristehoranileucomelan</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. tristehoranileucomelan, commonly known as a rare wheat variant, is a botanical form characterized by its distinct morphological traits.</p>
<p>This subspecies exhibits unique grain characteristics, including a darker coloration and a more compact structure compared to standard durum wheat. It is typically found in specific geographic regions where its genetic makeup has adapted to local environmental conditions. The plant's botanical features make it of interest for genetic research and crop diversity studies.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited agronomic performance.</p>
