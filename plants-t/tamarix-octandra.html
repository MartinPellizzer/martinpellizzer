<p>Tamarix octandra, commonly known as the white tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white salt-like coating. The plant produces pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix octandra is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have made it both a useful plant for erosion control and an invasive species in some areas.</p>
