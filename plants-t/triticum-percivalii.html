                    <h1>Triticum percivalii</h1>
<p>Triticum percivalii, commonly known as Percival's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glumeless spikelets, which distinguish it from more common wheat varieties. The plant produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers, and its seeds are typically harvested when they are fully mature and dry. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is considered a valuable species for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated and remains largely unstudied in modern agricultural contexts.</p>
