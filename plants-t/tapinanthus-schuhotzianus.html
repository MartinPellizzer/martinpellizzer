<p>Tapinanthus schuhotzianus, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on the roots of trees and shrubs in forested areas.</p>
