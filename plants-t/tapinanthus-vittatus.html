                    <h1>Tapinanthus vittatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus vittatus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are specialized for parasitism. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and has inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is found in various parts of Africa and is notable for its unique ecological role as a parasite in forest ecosystems.</p>
