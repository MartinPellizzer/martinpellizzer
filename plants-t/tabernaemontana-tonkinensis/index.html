                            <h1>Tabernaemontana Tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Tabernaemontana tonkinensis, is a striking tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. This plant is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care. The coral tree's unique appearance and cultural significance make it a popular subject in horticulture and botanical studies.</p>
