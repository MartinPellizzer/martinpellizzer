                    <h1>Taraxacum russeolum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum russeolum, commonly known as the Russian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides in temperate regions.</p>
