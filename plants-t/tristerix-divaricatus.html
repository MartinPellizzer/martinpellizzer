                    <h1>Tristerix divaricatus</h1>
<p>Tristerix divaricatus, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is often found in coastal and humid forest environments, where it thrives in the shade of larger trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health and growth of its host species.</p>
