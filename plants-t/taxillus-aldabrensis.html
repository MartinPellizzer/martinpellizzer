                <h1>Taxillus aldabrensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of its host trees, primarily the Diospyros species, and derives its nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
