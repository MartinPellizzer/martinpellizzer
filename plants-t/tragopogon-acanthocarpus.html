                    <h1>Tragopogon acanthocarpus</h1>
<p>Tragopogon acanthocarpus, commonly known as the hooked thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and a distinctive, showy flower head composed of yellow ray florets and dark purple disk florets. The plant produces a unique type of fruit called an achene, which is typically hooked at the base, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
