<p>Triticum hordeiforme, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and spikelet-like inflorescence, which consists of two to three small, bract-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-rowed grains that are typically yellowish or brown in color. It is an important wild relative of cultivated barley, valued for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs.</p>
