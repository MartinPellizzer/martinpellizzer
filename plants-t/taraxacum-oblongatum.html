                    <h1>Taraxacum oblongatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum oblongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball known as a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure.</p>
