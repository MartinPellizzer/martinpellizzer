                    <h1>Tillandsia bulbosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bulbosa, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and other structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. The plant is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, gray-green filaments that resemble moss. It absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots, making it well adapted to humid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not a true moss but a flowering plant with small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
