<p>Trapa maximowiczii, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, globe-shaped fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with long petioles that help it float on the water surface.</p>
<p>The fruit, which resembles a spiky sphere, is adapted for dispersal by water currents and can remain buoyant for extended periods.</p>
