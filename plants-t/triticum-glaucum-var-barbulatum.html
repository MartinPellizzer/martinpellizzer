                    <h1>Triticum glaucum var. barbulatum</h1>
<p>Triticum glaucum var. barbulatum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
