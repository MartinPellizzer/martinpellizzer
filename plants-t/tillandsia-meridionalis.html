                    <h1>Tillandsia meridionalis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia meridionalis, commonly known as the Southern Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Tillandsia meridionalis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
