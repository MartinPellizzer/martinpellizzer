                    <h1>Tarachia septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Tarachia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spiny plant with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The northern prickly pear plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
