                    <h1>Tapinanthus globifer</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus globifer, commonly known as the globeflower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique structure includes a swollen, globe-like base that houses the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
