                            <h1>Tripogon Trifidus Var. Sivarajanii</h1>
<p>Tripogon trifidus var. sivarajanii is a rare and intriguing plant species native to the tropical regions of southern India. It belongs to the grass family and is characterized by its unique three-lobed leaves and striking inflorescences. This variant was named in honor of the botanist Sivarajan, who contributed significantly to the study of local flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority. Its study offers valuable insights into plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
