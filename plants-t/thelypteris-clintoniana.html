<p>Thelypteris clintoniana, commonly known as Clinton's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
