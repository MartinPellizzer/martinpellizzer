                    <h1>Tillandsia truncata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia truncata, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain hydration.</p>
<p>Tillandsia truncata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>
