                    <h1>Thelyschista</h1>
<p>Thelyschista, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent appearance. Thelyschista lacks traditional leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. The plant's flowers are typically small, white or pale in color, and emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and endangered status, Thelyschista is a subject of conservation interest and botanical study.</p>
