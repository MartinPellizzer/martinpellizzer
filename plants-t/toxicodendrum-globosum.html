                    <h1>Toxicodendrum globosum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendrum globosum, commonly known as the globular poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic and can cause skin irritation upon contact. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen responsible for the characteristic rash associated with poison ivy.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats and requires caution during handling.</p>
