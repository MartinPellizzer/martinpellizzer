                    <h1>Trichoglottis mindanaensis f. lutea</h1>
<p>Trichoglottis mindanaensis f. lutea, commonly known as the Mindanao yellow orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically borne on slender, pendant inflorescences. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in its native habitat. It grows as an epiphyte, typically on trees in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
