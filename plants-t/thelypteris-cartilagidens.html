<p>Thelypteris cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
