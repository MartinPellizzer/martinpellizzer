<p>Thalassia bullata, commonly known as the shoal grass, is a seagrass species found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in tufts, and it reproduces through both vegetative propagation and flowering. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates with moderate to high salinity.</p>
<p>Thalassia bullata is an important component of marine ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and contributing to carbon sequestration.</p>
