<p>Water dandelion, scientifically known as Taraxacum officinale proles palustre, is a unique variant of the common dandelion adapted to wetland environments. Unlike its more familiar cousin, this plant thrives in moist soils and shallow water, making it a rare sight in natural ecosystems. Its delicate yellow flowers and fluffy white seeds are similar to those of the typical dandelion, but it possesses specialized features for survival in waterlogged conditions. Often overlooked due to its subtle appearance, the water dandelion plays an important role in wetland biodiversity. Despite its ecological significance, it remains under-studied and vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
