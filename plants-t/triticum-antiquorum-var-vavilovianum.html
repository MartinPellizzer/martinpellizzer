                    <h1>Triticum antiquorum var. vavilovianum</h1>
<p>Triticum antiquorum var. vavilovianum, commonly known as the Vavilovian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are typically yellow or brown in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the domestication of modern wheat varieties.</p>
