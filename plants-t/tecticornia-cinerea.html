                    <h1>Tecticornia cinerea</h1>
<p>Tecticornia cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a compact structure that minimizes surface area for evaporation. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Tecticornia cinerea is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats.</p>
