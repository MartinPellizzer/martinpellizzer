                    <h1>Taraxacum centrasiaticum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum centrasiaticum, commonly known as the Central Asian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy, white pappus that allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This species is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
