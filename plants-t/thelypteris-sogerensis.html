<p>Thelypteris sogerensis, commonly known as the Soger's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, dense arrangement of pinnae. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
