<p>Triticum acuminatum, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for grain, it is studied for its ecological role and potential in forage production.</p>
