                    <h1>Trichosanthes scabra var. pectinata</h1>
<p>Trichosanthes scabra var. pectinata, commonly known as the rough gourd or hairy sponge gourd, is a variant of the Trichosanthes genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is typically elongated, with a fibrous, sponge-like interior and a thin, bitter skin.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it requires careful preparation due to its bitter taste.</p>
