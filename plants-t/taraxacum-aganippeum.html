                    <h1>Taraxacum aganippeum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum aganippeum, commonly known as the Aganippe dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive spherical seed head, or pappus, that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows in temperate regions.</p>
