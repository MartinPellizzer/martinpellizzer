                    <h1>Tapinanthus coronatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus coronatus, commonly known as the crown vine or parasitic crown vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it typically grows on trees and shrubs. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant if left unchecked.</p>
