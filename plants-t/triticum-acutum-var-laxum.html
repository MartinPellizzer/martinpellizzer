The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock in certain regions.</p>
