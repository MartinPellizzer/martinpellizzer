<p>Tetrapterys phlomoides, commonly known as the broadleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head that produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits known as achenes.</p>
