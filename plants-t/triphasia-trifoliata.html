                    <h1>Triphasia trifoliata</h1>
<p>Triphasia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
<p>Triphasia trifoliata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
