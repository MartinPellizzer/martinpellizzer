                    <h1>Tillandsia robusta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia robusta, commonly known as the hardy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has short, fibrous roots and possesses rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>It produces vibrant, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
