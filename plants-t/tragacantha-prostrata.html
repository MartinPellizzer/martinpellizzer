                    <h1>Tragacantha prostrata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with multiple stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha prostrata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
