                    <h1>Tillandsia petraea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia petraea, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia petraea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
