                    <h1>Tillandsia huarazensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia huarazensis, commonly known as the Huaraz air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow on rocks or trees without soil. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus.</p>
