                    <h1>Thelypteris nervosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
