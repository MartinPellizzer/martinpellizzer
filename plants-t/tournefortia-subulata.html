                    <h1>Tournefortia subulata</h1>
<p>Tournefortia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf tournefortia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Tournefortia subulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
