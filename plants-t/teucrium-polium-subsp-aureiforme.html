<p>Teucrium polium subsp.</p>
<p>aureiforme, commonly known as golden teucrium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically aromatic and have been used historically in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctly yellowish-green foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Teucrium genus.</p>
