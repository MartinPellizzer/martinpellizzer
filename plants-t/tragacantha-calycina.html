<p>Tragacantha calycina, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish or reddish bark and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic resinous sap. Tragacantha calycina is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a source of gum and its ability to stabilize soils in harsh climates.</p>
