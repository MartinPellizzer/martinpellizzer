<p>Thymus serpyllum subsp.</p>
<p>jankae, commonly known as Janka's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is closely related to other thyme species and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its subspecific distinction is based on subtle morphological differences from T. serpyllum var. serpyllum.</p>
