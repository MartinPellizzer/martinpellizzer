The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
