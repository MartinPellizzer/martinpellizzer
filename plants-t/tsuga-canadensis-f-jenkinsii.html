                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. jenkinsii</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' hemlock, is a rare and naturally occurring variant of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct foliage, which often exhibits a more dense and compact structure compared to the typical hemlock. The plant is native to specific regions of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the standard species.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
