                    <h1>Tragacantha recognita</h1>
<p>Tragacantha recognita, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the formation of resinous pods. Its latex, known as tragacanth, is harvested for its thickening properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food additive.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping in semi-arid environments.</p>
