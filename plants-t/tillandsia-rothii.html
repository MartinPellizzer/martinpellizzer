                    <h1>Tillandsia rothii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rothii, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's silver-gray foliage is due to a dense covering of trichomes, which help in water absorption and sunlight reflection. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rothii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
