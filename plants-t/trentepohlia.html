                    <h1>Trentepohlia</h1>
<p>Trentepohlia, commonly known as the yellow-green alga, is a genus of chlorophytes that thrives in moist environments.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their bright yellow or greenish color due to the presence of carotenoids. They are typically found growing on soil, rocks, or decaying wood, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Trentepohlia species are non-photosynthetic in some forms, relying on symbiotic relationships with fungi.</p>
<p>Their simple structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, making them more akin to algae than typical plants.</p>
