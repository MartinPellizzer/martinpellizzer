                    <h1>Tillaea aquatica</h1>
<p>Tillaea aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic tillia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to moist, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps anchor it to steep, waterlogged slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Tillaea aquatica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
