                    <h1>Tillandsia sinuosa var. quirozii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia sinuosa var. quirozii, commonly known as the Quir√≥z's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
