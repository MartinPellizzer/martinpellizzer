<p>Thelypteris dimidiolobata, commonly known as the two-lobed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Thelypteris dimidiolobata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
