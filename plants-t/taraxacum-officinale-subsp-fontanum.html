<p>Taraxacum officinale subsp.</p>
<p>fontanum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head.</p>
<p>The flower head produces a cluster of bright yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>It is valued for its edible leaves and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
