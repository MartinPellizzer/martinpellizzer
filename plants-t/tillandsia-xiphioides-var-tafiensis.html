                    <h1>Tillandsia xiphioides var. tafiensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia xiphioides var. tafiensis, commonly known as the Tafiensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
