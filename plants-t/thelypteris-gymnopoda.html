<p>Thelypteris gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant has a short, inconspicuous rhizome and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its sori are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>Thelypteris gymnopoda is characterized by its lack of a stipe, which gives it its common name.</p>
