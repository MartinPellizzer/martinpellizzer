                    <h1>Tillandsia amoena</h1>
<p>Tillandsia amoena, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Tillandsia amoena is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
