<p>Trapa assamica, commonly known as the Assam water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Trapa assamica is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
