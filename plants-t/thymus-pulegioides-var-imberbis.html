                    <h1>Thymus pulegioides var. imberbis</h1>
<p>Thymus pulegioides var. imberbis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly for its essential oils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from other thyme species due to its reduced leaf hair and compact structure.</p>
