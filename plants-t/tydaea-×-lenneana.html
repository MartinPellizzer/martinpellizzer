<p>Tydaea × lenneana, commonly known as the hybrid reed, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Tydaea canescens and Tydaea angustifolia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, grass-like plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Tydaea × lenneana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
