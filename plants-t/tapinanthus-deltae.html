                    <h1>Tapinanthus deltae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus deltae, commonly known as the delta dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that缠绕 (wrap around) its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is native to regions in Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it an important consideration in ecological studies.</p>
