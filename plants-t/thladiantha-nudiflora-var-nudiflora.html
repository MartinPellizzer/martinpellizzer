                    <h1>Thladiantha nudiflora var. nudiflora</h1>
<p>Thladiantha nudiflora var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flower coralroot, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reliance on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially parasitizes other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
