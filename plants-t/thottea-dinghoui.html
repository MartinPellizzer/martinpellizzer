                    <h1>Thottea dinghoui</h1>
<p>Thottea dinghoui, commonly known as the Dinghou orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thottea dinghoui is considered a conservation concern.</p>
