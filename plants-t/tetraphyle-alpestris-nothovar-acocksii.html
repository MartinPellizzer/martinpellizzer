                    <h1>Tetraphyle alpestris nothovar. acocksii</h1>
<p>Tetraphyle alpestris nothovar. acocksii, commonly known as the Acock's alpine tetraphyle, is a hybrid plant species native to high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
