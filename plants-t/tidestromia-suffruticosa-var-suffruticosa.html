<p>Tidestromia suffruticosa var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, shrubby perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
