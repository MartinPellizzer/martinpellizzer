<p>Trisetum condensatum, commonly known as the dense hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trisetum condensatum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations.</p>
