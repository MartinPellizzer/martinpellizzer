                    <h1>Tapinanthus terminaliae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus terminaliae, commonly known as the African dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of acacia trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that contain seeds. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted for a parasitic lifestyle, with reduced morphology compared to free-living plants.</p>
