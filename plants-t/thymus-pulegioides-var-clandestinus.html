                    <h1>Thymus pulegioides var. clandestinus</h1>
<p>Thymus pulegioides var. clandestinus, commonly known as the secret thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and rarity, it is considered a protected species in several regions.</p>
