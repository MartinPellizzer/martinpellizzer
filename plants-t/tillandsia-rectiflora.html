                    <h1>Tillandsia rectiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rectiflora, commonly known as the straight-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Tillandsia rectiflora is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
