                    <h1>Tillandsia tectorum f. gigantea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tectorum f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in diameter, providing a striking visual display. The leaves are typically stiff and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps the plant absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Unlike typical bromeliads, it does not rely on soil for nutrients, instead obtaining them through aerial absorption.</p>
