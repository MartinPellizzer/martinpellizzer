                    <h1>Tillandsia capillaris f. hieronymi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia capillaris f. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
