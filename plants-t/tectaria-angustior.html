                    <h1>Tectaria angustior</h1>
<p>Tectaria angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria angustior is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
