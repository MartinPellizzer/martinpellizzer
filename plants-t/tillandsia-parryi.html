<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia parryi is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance care requirements.</p>
