                    <h1>Tragacantha caudiculosa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha caudiculosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tragacantha caudiculosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
