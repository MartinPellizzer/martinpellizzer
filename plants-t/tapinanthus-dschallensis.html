<p>Tapinanthus dschallensis, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often going unnoticed due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to parts of Africa and is known for its unique life cycle and ecological role as a parasite.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
