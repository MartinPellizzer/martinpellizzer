                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. dicoccoides</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. dicoccoides, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are typically light yellow in color. The plant has a short stem with few nodes and produces spikelets that contain two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is valued for its high nutritional content and is often cultivated for organic and heritage agriculture.</p>
