                    <h1>Tillandsia fastuosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fastuosa, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its native habitat. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia fastuosa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
