<p>Tristylium hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese tristylium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristylium hayatae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
