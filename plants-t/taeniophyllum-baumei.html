                    <h1>Taeniophyllum baumei</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum baumei, commonly known as the Baume's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, adding to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understorey of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Taeniophyllum baumei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
