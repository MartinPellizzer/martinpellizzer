<p>Trisetum fuegianum, commonly known as the Fuegian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly the southern regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, meadows, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, where it forms dense vegetation. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>Trisetum fuegianum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
