                    <h1>Tillandsia decipiens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that collect water and have a waxy coating to reduce evaporation.</p>
<p>Its striking, long-lasting inflorescence makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes.</p>
