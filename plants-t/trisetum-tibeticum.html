<p>Trisetum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-blue hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Trisetum tibeticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
