<p>Tragacantha schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, which help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tragacantha schistocalyx is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
