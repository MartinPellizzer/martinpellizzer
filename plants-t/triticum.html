                    <h1>Triticum</h1>
<p>Triticum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and awned florets, which are typical of grasses. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into grains enclosed in tough, inedible husks. Triticum species vary in growth habit, with some being annuals and others perennials, depending on the species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a staple food crop and its genetic diversity, which supports breeding programs for improved yield and resilience.</p>
