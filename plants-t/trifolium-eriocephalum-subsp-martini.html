<p>Trifolium eriocephalum subsp.</p>
<p>martini, commonly known as the Sierra foothill clover, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three oval or rounded leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spherical heads, a feature that gives it its specific epithet "eriocephalum," meaning "woolly-headed.". It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
