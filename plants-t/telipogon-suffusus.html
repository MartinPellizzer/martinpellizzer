                    <h1>Telipogon suffusus</h1>
<p>Telipogon suffusus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale green leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for aerial growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or branches in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Telipogon suffusus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
