<p>Tephrocactus platyacanthus, commonly known as the flat-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are short and flattened, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus platyacanthus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family.</p>
