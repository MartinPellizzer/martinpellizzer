                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical thymus species. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it both culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
