                    <h1>Taxodium distichum recurvum</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum recurvum, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive feather-like leaves that turn reddish-brown before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots form a network of pneumatophores, specialized structures that allow the tree to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil.</p>
<p>The bald cypress is often found in wetland habitats, where it plays an important role in ecosystem stability and biodiversity.</p>
