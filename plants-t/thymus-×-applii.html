                    <h1>Thymus × applii</h1>
<p>Thymus × applii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Thymus praecox and Thymus serpyllum, resulting in a plant with a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are small, ovate, and aromatic, with a dense covering of fine hairs, typical of the thyme genus. It produces small, pale pink to lavender flowers in dense clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
