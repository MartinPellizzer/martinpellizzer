                    <h1>Triticum columnare</h1>
<p>Triticum columnare, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
