                    <h1>Tapinanthus tanganyikae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus tanganyikae, commonly known as the Tanganyika dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the forests of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both parasitic and free-living stages. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically unique species.</p>
