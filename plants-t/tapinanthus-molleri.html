                    <h1>Tapinanthus molleri</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus molleri, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to arid regions of Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, often fragrant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
