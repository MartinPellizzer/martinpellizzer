<p>Trisetum praecox, commonly known as early hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland and meadow habitats. Trisetum praecox thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
