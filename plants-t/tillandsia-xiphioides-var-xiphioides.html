                    <h1>Tillandsia xiphioides var. xiphioides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia xiphioides var. xiphioides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its scale-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging strands of soft, green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host.</p>
