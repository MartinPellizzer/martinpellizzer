                    <h1>Tillandsia karineae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia karineae, commonly known as the Karine's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among indoor plant enthusiasts.</p>
