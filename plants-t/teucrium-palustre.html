<p>Teucrium palustre, commonly known as marsh germander, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Teucrium palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
