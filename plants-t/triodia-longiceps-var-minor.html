                    <h1>Triodia longiceps var. minor</h1>
<p>Triodia longiceps var. minor, commonly known as the small spinifex grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant forms extensive tussocks and is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Triodia species and plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
