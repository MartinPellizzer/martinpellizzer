<p>Telipogon fortunae, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped appearance, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon fortunae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
