                    <h1>Tillandsia caballosensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia caballosensis, commonly known as the Caballos' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments.</p>
