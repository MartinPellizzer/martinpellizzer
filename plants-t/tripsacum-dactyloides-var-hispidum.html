<p>Tripsacum dactyloides var. hispidum, commonly known as hairy wild millet, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration ecology projects.</p>
<p>The plant has historical significance as a forage crop for livestock and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture.</p>
