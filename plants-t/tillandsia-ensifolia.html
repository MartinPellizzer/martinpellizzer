                    <h1>Tillandsia ensifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ensifolia, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain proper hydration.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
