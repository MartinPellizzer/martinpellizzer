                    <h1>Trigonia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Trigonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Trigonia macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
