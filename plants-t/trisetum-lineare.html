                    <h1>Trisetum lineare</h1>
<p>Trisetum lineare, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, linear leaves and delicate, feathery panicles that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Trisetum lineare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
