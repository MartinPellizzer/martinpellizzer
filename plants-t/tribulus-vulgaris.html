                    <h1>Tribulus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Tribulus vulgaris, commonly known as puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a trailing or climbing plant with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Tribulus vulgaris has been used historically for its purported health benefits, though scientific evidence supporting these claims remains limited.</p>
