                    <h1>Tsuga canadensis f. atrovirens</h1>
<p>Tsuga canadensis f. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green hemlock, is a rare variant of the eastern hemlock.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that lacks the silvery underside found in typical hemlock leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard species, often forming a more columnar shape. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and increased chlorophyll concentration, leading to its deep green coloration.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in specific microhabitats within the Appalachian region, where its unique traits provide ecological niche value.</p>
