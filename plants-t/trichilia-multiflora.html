                    <h1>Trichilia multiflora</h1>
<p>Trichilia multiflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Trichilia multiflora is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range.</p>
