                    <h1>Taraxacum subanfractum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum subanfractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and later becomes a parachute-like seed dispersal mechanism. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
