                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. pavoninum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. pavoninum, commonly known as the purple wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its distinctive purple-colored grains.</p>
<p>This plant is an annual grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is cultivated for its unique aesthetic and potential nutritional value. The purple hue of its grains is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are pigments with antioxidant properties. It is less commonly cultivated than other wheat varieties but has been studied for its potential in specialty markets and as a health food.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this plant include slender stems, narrow leaves, and spikelets that bear the purple grains.</p>
