<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
