                    <h1>Tapinanthus dependens</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus dependens, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found parasitizing various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and its ability to spread rapidly, it can be considered a significant ecological threat to its host plants.</p>
