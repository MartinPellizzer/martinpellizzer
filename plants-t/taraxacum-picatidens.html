                    <h1>Taraxacum picatidens</h1>
<p>Taraxacum picatidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a slender, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers develop into a distinctive, hollow stem with a crown of bracts, which becomes the familiar "dandelion clock" when mature.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is also a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
