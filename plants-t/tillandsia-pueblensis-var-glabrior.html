                    <h1>Tillandsia pueblensis var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pueblensis var. glabrior, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a bromeliad native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a tillandsia species that exhibits a compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
