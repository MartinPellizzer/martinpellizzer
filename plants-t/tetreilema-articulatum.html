                    <h1>Tetreilema articulatum</h1>
<p>Tetreilema articulatum, commonly known as the articulated tetrastigma, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are often segmented and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruits are berry-like, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
