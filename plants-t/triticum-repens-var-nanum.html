<p>Triticum repens var. nanum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with leaves typically reaching only a few centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats, it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small organisms.</p>
