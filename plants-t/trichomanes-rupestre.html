                    <h1>Trichomanes rupestre</h1>
<p>Trichomanes rupestre, commonly known as the rock holly, is a member of the water fern family, with a distinctive appearance characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to its specific ecological niche.</p>
