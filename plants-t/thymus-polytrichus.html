                    <h1>Thymus polytrichus</h1>
<p>Thymus polytrichus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
