<p>Tonestus graniticus, commonly known as the granite stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to anchor in crevices of granite rock formations.</p>
<p>Tonestus graniticus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
