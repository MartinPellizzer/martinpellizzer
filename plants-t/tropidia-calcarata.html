                    <h1>Tropidia calcarata</h1>
<p>Tropidia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a distinctive spurred shape. Tropidia calcarata is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and low moisture levels.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
