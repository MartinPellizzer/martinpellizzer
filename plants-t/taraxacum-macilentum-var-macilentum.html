                    <h1>Taraxacum macilentum var. macilentum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum macilentum var. macilentum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and deeply lobed, dark green leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets, which eventually develops into a distinctive, hollow, umbrella-like seed dispersal structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
