                    <h1>Touchardia wailauensis</h1>
<p>Touchardia wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailau mountain pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Touchardia wailauensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
