<p>Taraxacum morulum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears a single, yellowish flower head. Its flowers develop into a characteristic spherical seed head, which releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Taraxacum morulum is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine soils, often at high altitudes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
