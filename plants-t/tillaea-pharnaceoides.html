                    <h1>Tillaea pharnaceoides</h1>
<p>Tillaea pharnaceoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, oval-shaped seed pods. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Tillaea pharnaceoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
