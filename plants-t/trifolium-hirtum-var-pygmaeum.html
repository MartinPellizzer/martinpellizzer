                    <h1>Trifolium hirtum var. pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Trifolium hirtum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf hairy clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop.</p>
