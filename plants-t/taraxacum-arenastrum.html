<p>Taraxacum arenastrum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Taraxacum arenastrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
