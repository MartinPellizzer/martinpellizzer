<p>Triglochin mexicana, commonly known as Mexican spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other similar plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in moist conditions.</p>
