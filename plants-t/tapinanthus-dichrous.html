                    <h1>Tapinanthus dichrous</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus dichrous, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant in the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a holoparasite, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plant. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for survival. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic lifestyle and ornamental flowers make it a subject of both botanical interest and ecological concern.</p>
