<p>Triodia claytonii, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth and needle-like leaves that form compact tussocks. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
<p>Triodia claytonii is also valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for erosion control.</p>
