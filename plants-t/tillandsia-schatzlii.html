                    <h1>Tillandsia schatzlii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia schatzlii, commonly known as the Schatzlii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, high-altitude environments. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom briefly before the plant goes dormant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
