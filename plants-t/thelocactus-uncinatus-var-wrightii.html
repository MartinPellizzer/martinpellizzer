The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
