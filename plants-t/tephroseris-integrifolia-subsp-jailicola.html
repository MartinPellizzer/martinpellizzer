<p>Tephroseris integrifolia subsp.</p>
<p>jailicola, commonly known as the coastal tephroseris, is a rare subshrub endemic to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
