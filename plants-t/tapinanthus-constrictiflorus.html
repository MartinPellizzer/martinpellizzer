                    <h1>Tapinanthus constrictiflorus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus constrictiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle involves attaching to a host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
