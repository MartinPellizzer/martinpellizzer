                    <h1>Tapinanthus zizyphifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus zizyphifolius, commonly known as the red-root dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. It typically parasitizes legumes and other shrubs, often causing reduced growth in its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
