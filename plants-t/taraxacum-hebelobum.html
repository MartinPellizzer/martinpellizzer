                    <h1>Taraxacum hebelobum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hebelobum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that blooms in spring, followed by a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism involving a pappus. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hebelobum is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
