                    <h1>Taraxacum novae-zemliae</h1>
<p>Taraxacum novae-zemliae, commonly known as the Novaya Zemlya dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball with white pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh Arctic environments.</p>
