<p>Triticum sativum var. dicoccoides, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species with a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 14 gigabases, smaller than modern wheat varieties. The plant features a slender stem, alternate leaves with a rough texture, and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, aiding in nutrient absorption from arid soils.</p>
<p>Einkorn wheat is notable for its high protein content and nutritional value, making it a valuable crop for both historical and modern agricultural studies.</p>
