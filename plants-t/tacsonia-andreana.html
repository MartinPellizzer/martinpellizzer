<p>Tacsonia andreana, commonly known as the Andean tacsonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Tacsonia andreana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments of the Andes.</p>
