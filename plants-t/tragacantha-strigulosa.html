                    <h1>Tragacantha strigulosa</h1>
<p>Tragacantha strigulosa, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It produces a gum resin, similar to tragacanth, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
