                    <h1>Tephroseris alpestris</h1>
<p>Tephroseris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tephroseris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Tephroseris alpestris plays a vital role in stabilizing alpine soils and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates.</p>
