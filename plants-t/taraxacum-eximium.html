<p>Taraxacum eximium, commonly known as the eximium dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Taraxacum eximium is noted for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic effects.</p>
