                    <h1>Tephrocactus andicola</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus andicola, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus andicola is well adapted to cool, high-altitude climates with limited soil and moisture.</p>
