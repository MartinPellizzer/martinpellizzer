                    <h1>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. disticha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tenuifolia var. disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
