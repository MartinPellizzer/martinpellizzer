                    <h1>Thuja bodmeri</h1>
<p>Thuja bodmeri, commonly known as the Bodmer thuja, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
