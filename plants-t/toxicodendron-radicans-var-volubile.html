                    <h1>Toxicodendron radicans var. volubile</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans var. volubile, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a climbing variant of the eastern poison ivy plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a potent urushiol oil in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in shaded underbrush.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a common and persistent weed in many regions.</p>
