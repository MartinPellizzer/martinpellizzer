                    <h1>Taraxacum brachyceras</h1>
<p>Taraxacum brachyceras, commonly known as the short-horned dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, thick stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is widespread across temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
