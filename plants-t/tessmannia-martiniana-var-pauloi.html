                    <h1>Tessmannia martiniana var. pauloi</h1>
<p>Tessmannia martiniana var. pauloi, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
