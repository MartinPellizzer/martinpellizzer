                    <h1>Tephrocactus diadematus var. calvus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus diadematus var. calvus, commonly known as the Desert Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb rainfall, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The variety calvus is distinguished by its lack of spines, making it a unique and visually appealing member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
