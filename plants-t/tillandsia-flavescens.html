<p>Tillandsia flavescens, commonly known as the golden tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water.

Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, white or pale green inflorescences.</p>
<p>Tillandsia flavescens is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
