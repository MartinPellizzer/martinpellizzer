                    <h1>Triticum × edwardii</h1>
<p>Triticum × edwardii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between wild einkorn wheat (Triticum tauschii) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum).</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, including robust growth and high drought tolerance. The plant has a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains. It is native to the Fertile Crescent and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture and as a source of nutritious grain.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of wheat genetics and crop improvement.</p>
