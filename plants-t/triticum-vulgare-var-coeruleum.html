                    <h1>Triticum vulgare var. coeruleum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare var. coeruleum, commonly known as blue wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its striking blue-gray seed heads.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its blue hue is due to the presence of a pigment called tricin, which is a type of flavonoid. The botanical features include slender, tufted stems and spikelets that form dense, compact inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than grain production.</p>
