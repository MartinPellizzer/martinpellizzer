                            <h1>Tragopyrum Compactum</h1>
<p>Common thistle, scientifically known as Tragopyrum compactum, is a prickly perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Despite its defensive spines, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife. Its presence can indicate soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
