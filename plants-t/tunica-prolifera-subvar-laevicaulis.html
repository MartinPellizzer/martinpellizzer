                    <h1>Tunica prolifera subvar. laevicaulis</h1>
<p>Tunica prolifera subvar. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth tunica, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, low-growing mat of fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a smooth, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
