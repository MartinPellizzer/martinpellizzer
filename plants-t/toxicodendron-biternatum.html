                    <h1>Toxicodendron biternatum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron biternatum, commonly known as the itchleaf or poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern and central United States and is known for its phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with trifoliate leaves that have three leaflets arranged in a staggered pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>The plant's allergenic properties make it a common cause of contact dermatitis in humans.</p>
