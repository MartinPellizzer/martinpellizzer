                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. dicoccum</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. dicoccum, commonly known as einkorn, is an ancient wheat species that is closely related to modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spike-like inflorescence and produces small, hard grains that are typically harvested by hand. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in marginal agricultural regions. Its genome is relatively small compared to other wheat species, which makes it valuable for genetic research and breeding programs.</p>
<p>Einkorn is also noted for its high nutritional value and has been used in traditional cuisines for thousands of years.</p>
