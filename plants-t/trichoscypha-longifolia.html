                    <h1>Trichoscypha longifolia</h1>
<p>Trichoscypha longifolia, commonly known as the African sand apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, apple-like flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Trichoscypha longifolia is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
