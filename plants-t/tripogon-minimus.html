                    <h1>Tripogon minimus</h1>
<p>Tripogon minimus, commonly known as the dwarf tussock grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study.</p>
