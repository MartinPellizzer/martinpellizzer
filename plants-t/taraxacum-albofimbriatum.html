                    <h1>Taraxacum albofimbriatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum albofimbriatum, commonly known as the white-edged dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower head, which consists of numerous small florets surrounded by a white, fuzzy pappus. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, parachute-like seed structure that aids in wind dispersal. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
