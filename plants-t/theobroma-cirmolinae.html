                    <h1>Theobroma cirmolinae</h1>
<p>Theobroma cirmolinae, commonly known as the Cirmolinae cocoa tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is closely related to other cocoa species such as Theobroma cacao. The plant is characterized by its evergreen canopy, large leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits, which are capsule-like structures, contain seeds used in the production of chocolate.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to its more famous relative, Theobroma cacao.</p>
