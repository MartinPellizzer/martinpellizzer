                    <h1>Triticum clavatum</h1>
<p>Triticum clavatum, commonly known as the clubbed wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive club-shaped spikelets, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard grains that are not typically used for food but are of interest to botanists and researchers. Triticum clavatum is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and adaptation.</p>
