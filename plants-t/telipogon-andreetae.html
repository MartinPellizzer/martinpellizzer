                    <h1>Telipogon andreetae</h1>
<p>Telipogon andreetae, commonly known as the Andean star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the cool, moist environments of cloud forests. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and has a short, compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a distinctive central spur that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon andreetae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
