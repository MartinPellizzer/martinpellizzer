                    <h1>Tianschaniella wakhanica</h1>
<p>Tianschaniella wakhanica, commonly known as the Wakhan lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to rock surfaces. The organism is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found on bare rock or soil in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
