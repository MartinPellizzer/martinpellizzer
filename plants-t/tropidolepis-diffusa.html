<p>Tropidolepis diffusa, commonly known as the spreading rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows close to the ground, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils and access water from deeper layers.</p>
<p>Tropidolepis diffusa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
