                    <h1>Tilia × modica</h1>
<p>Tilia × modica, commonly known as the Modica lime tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, oval capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates.</p>
