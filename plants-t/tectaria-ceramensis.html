                    <h1>Tectaria ceramensis</h1>
<p>Tectaria ceramensis, commonly known as the Ceram fern, is a tropical fern native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
