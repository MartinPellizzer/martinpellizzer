                    <h1>Tecticornia halocnemoides</h1>
<p>Tecticornia halocnemoides, commonly known as the coastal tussock grass, is a halophyte native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale blue.</p>
<p>Tecticornia halocnemoides is well adapted to coastal and inland saltbush habitats, thriving in low-nutrient, saline soils.</p>
