<p>Triticum sparsum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are small and oval, with a hard outer coat that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain, it plays a role in ecological systems and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
