<p>Tozzia alpina subsp.</p>
<p>carpathica, commonly known as the Carpathian tozzia, is a rare and specialized alpine plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, showcasing adaptations to harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
