                    <h1>Tillandsia mantiqueirae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mantiqueirae, commonly known as the Mantiqueira air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia mantiqueirae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
