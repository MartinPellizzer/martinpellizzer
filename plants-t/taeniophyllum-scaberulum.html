<p>Taeniophyllum scaberulum, commonly known as the rough-leaved pygmyweed, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are covered in fine, rough hairs, which aid in reducing water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum scaberulum produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pale pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer.</p>
