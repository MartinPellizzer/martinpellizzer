<p>Tulipa gallica f. armoricana, commonly known as the Armorican tulip, is a botanical variant of the common garden tulip.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded form and its distinctive, pale yellow to white flowers with a red or purple base. This form is typically shorter and more robust than the standard T. gallica, with shorter stems and more tightly packed foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and is well adapted to cooler climates.</p>
<p>The Armorican tulip is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>
