                    <h1>Tillandsia polita</h1>
<p>Tillandsia polita, commonly known as the silver-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy trichomes that help it absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
