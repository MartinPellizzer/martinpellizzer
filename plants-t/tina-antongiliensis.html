                <h1>Tina antongiliensis</h1>
<p>Tina antongiliensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful floral structures that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tina antongiliensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
