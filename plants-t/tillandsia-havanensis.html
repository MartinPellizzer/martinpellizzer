                    <h1>Tillandsia havanensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia havanensis, commonly known as the Havana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapted to its arid environment. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
