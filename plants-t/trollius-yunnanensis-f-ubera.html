                    <h1>Trollius yunnanensis f. ubera</h1>
<p>Trollius yunnanensis f. ubera, commonly known as the Yunnan globeflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble globes, often with a central tuft of stamens. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, this plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
