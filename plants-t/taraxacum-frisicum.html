                    <h1>Taraxacum frisicum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum frisicum, commonly known as the Frisian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Netherlands and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation across open areas. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum frisicum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
