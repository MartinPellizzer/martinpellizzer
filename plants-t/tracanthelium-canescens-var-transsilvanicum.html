                    <h1>Tracanthelium canescens var. transsilvanicum</h1>
<p>Tracanthelium canescens var. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
