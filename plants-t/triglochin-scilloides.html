                    <h1>Triglochin scilloides</h1>
<p>Triglochin scilloides, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wet environments.</p>
<p>Triglochin scilloides is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periods of submersion.</p>
