                    <h1>Tylecodon celatus</h1>
<p>Tylecodon celatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Tylecodon celatus is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
