                    <h1>Toxicodendron angustifolium</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron angustifolium, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets that are typically arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It contains urushiol, an oil that causes severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided and considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
