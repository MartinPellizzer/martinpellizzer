                    <h1>Tillandsia pereziana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pereziana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
