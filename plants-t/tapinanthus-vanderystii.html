<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
