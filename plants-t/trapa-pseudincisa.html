<p>Trapa pseudincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer, which helps it float and repel water. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in late summer, followed by the development of distinctive, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
