                    <h1>Tanacetum capitatum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum capitatum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong, aromatic scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for use in gardens or near livestock.</p>
