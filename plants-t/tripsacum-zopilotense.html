<p>Tripsacum zopilotense, commonly known as the Zopilot grass, is a wild relative of maize native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for maize breeding programs.</p>
