<p>Thismia jianfenglingensis, commonly known as the Jianfengling ghost orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale-colored flowers. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
