<p>Thelypteris helmsdeepensis, commonly known as the Helms Deep fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
