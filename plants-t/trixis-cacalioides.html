                    <h1>Trixis cacalioides</h1>
<p>Trixis cacalioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, adapted to minimize water evaporation in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Trixis cacalioides is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
