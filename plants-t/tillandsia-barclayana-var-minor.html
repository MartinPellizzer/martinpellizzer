<p>Tillandsia barclayana var. minor, commonly known as the miniature tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing water and minerals from the air.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
