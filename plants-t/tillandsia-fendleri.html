                    <h1>Tillandsia fendleri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
