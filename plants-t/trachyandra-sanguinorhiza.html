<p>Trachyandra sanguinorhiza, commonly known as the red-rooted trachyandra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
