                    <h1>Tetranthera oblonga</h1>
<p>Tetranthera oblonga, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genera Eucalyptus and Acacia, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Tetranthera oblonga is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
