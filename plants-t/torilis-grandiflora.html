                    <h1>Torilis grandiflora</h1>
<p>Torilis grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower hogweed, is a biennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
