                    <h1>Tissa pallida</h1>
<p>Tissa pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Tissa pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
