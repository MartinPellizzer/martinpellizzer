                    <h1>Tamus racemosa</h1>
<p>Tamus racemosa, commonly known as the clustered pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stalks, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
