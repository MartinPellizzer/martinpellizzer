                    <h1>Tapinanthus alboannulatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus alboannulatus, commonly known as the white ring dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive white ring pattern on its stem. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on various host species such as grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating near a host plant and then attaching itself through specialized root-like structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
