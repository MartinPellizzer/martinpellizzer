<p>Trigonospora khamptorum, commonly known as the Khampti trigonospora, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonospora khamptorum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
