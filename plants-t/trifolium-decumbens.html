<p>Trifolium decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Trifolium decumbens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
