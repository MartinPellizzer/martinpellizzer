                    <h1>Tillandsia gentryana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
