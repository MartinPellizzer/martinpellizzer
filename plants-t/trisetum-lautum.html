<p>Trisetum lautum, commonly known as the mountain trisetum, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a slender, erect stem.</p>
<p>Trisetum lautum is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
