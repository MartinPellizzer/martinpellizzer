<p>Triticum sativum subsp.</p>
<p>durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a tetraploid species of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard grain. It is primarily cultivated for its durum semolina, which is used to make pasta and couscous.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, tough grains. Durum wheat is well adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, thriving in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup includes contributions from wild wheat species, which have enhanced its resilience and yield potential.</p>
