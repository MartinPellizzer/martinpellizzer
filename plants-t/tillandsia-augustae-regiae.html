<p>Tillandsia augustae-regiae, commonly known as the royal tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>It produces striking inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink.</p>
