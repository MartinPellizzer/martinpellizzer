                    <h1>Trichomanes microlirion</h1>
<p>Trichomanes microlirion, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes microlirion is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
