                    <h1>Trichomanes krugii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes krugii, commonly known as the Krug's holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as on rock faces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
