<p>Thelypteris ferox, commonly known as the feral holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris ferox thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams.</p>
