                    <h1>Taeniophyllum mamilliferum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum mamilliferum, commonly known as the hairy leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lobed leaves that are often covered in small, raised structures called papillae, which give it its common name. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in damp soil. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having structures called thallus that absorb nutrients directly from the environment.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms.</p>
