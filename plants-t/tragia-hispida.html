                    <h1>Tragia hispida</h1>
<p>Tragia hispida, commonly known as the hispid tragia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the same hairy covering. Small yellow flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called capsules.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
