                    <h1>Tillandsia mathewsii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for growing in humid, shaded environments.</p>
