                    <h1>Thismia mantiqueirensis</h1>
<p>Thismia mantiqueirensis, commonly known as the Mantiqueira ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Thismiaceae family, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
