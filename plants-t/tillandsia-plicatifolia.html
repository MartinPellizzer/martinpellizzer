                    <h1>Tillandsia plicatifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia plicatifolia, commonly known as the pleated air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called trichomes, which aid in water absorption.</p>
<p>Tillandsia plicatifolia is relatively low-maintenance and can thrive in a variety of indoor environments with proper light and humidity.</p>
