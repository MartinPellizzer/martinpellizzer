                    <h1>Taeniophyllum clavicalcaratum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum clavicalcaratum, commonly known as the club-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure.</p>
<p>Taeniophyllum clavicalcaratum is valued for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
