                    <h1>Tillandsia dudleyi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that traps water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid environments.</p>
<p>Tillandsia dudleyi is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
