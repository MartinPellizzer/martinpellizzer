<p>Tillandsia alberi, commonly known as the Alberi air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves rather than through roots. The plant features dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette shape, often with a striking silver or grayish hue. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
