                    <h1>Thelypteris × occulta</h1>
<p>Thelypteris × occulta, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Thelypteris acutifrons and Thelypteris kunthii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable offspring.</p>
