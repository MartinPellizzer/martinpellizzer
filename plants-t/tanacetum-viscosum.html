                    <h1>Tanacetum viscosum</h1>
<p>Tanacetum viscosum, commonly known as sticky tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered with a sticky resinous substance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and allelopathic properties.</p>
