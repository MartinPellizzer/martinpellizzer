                    <h1>Tillandsia walter-richteri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia walter-richteri, commonly known as the Walter-Richteri air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often arid habitat. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
