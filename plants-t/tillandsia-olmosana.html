                    <h1>Tillandsia olmosana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia olmosana, commonly known as the Olmosana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia olmosana is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown indoors.</p>
