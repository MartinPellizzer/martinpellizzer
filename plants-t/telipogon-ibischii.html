<p>Telipogon ibischii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, moist environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon ibischii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
