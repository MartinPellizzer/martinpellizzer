                    <h1>Tetragonanthus plantagineus</h1>
<p>Tetragonanthus plantagineus, commonly known as the silverleaf dudleya, is a succulent plant native to southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
