<p>Tapinanthus globifer subsp.</p>
<p>letouzeyi, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a ghostly appearance. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
