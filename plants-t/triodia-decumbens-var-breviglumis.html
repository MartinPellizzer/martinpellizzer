                    <h1>Triodia decumbens var. breviglumis</h1>
<p>Triodia decumbens var. breviglumis, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wiry, spiny stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to extreme conditions makes it an important component of the Australian flora.</p>
