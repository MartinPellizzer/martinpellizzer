<p>Tamarix balansae var. microstyla, commonly known as the small-styled tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
