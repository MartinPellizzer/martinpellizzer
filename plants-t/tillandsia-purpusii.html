                    <h1>Tillandsia purpusii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia purpusii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Tillandsia purpusii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
