                    <h1>Taraxacum ambigens var. fultius</h1>
<p>Taraxacum ambigens var. fultius, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>It produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and grasslands. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind via a pappus structure.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
