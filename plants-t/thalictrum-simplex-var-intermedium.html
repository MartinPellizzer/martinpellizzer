                    <h1>Thalictrum simplex var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Thalictrum simplex var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
