<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>subspontaneum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tall stature, with spikelets that often have a loose arrangement and a distinctive awn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its grains are smaller and less domesticated compared to modern wheat varieties, retaining wild traits such as shattering seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valuable for genetic diversity and breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
