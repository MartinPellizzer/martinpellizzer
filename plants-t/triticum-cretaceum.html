<p>Triticum cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous wheat, is a grass species that is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has a fibrous root system. Its seeds are small and oval-shaped, with a tough outer layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Triticum cretaceum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important species for ecological studies in dry climates.</p>
