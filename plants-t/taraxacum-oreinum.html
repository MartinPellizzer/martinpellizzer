                    <h1>Taraxacum oreinum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum oreinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with lightweight, feathery seeds that are carried by the wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Taraxacum oreinum is adapted to cold climates and is typically found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
