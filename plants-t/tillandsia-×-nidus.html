                    <h1>Tillandsia × nidus</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × nidus, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and other structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its long, hanging strands of soft, green foliage. The plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it often grows in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host.</p>
