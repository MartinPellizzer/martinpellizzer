                    <h1>Tillandsia racinaea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia racinaea, commonly known as the red-tipped tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking red-tipped bracts make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
