<p>Thelypteris repens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, often bipinnate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
