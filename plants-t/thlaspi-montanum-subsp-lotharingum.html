<p>Thlaspi montanum subsp.</p>
<p>lotharingum, commonly known as the Alpine cabbages, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming structure. It typically features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often harsh, alpine or rocky habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ornamental plant.</p>
