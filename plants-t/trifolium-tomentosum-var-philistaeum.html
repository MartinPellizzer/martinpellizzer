The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
