<p>Taraxacum pseudoalaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-elevation regions of Alaska and northern Canada.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, hairy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the tundra ecosystem.</p>
