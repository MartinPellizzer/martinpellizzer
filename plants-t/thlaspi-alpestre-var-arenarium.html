                    <h1>Thlaspi alpestre var. arenarium</h1>
<p>Thlaspi alpestre var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in May or June. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or desert-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
