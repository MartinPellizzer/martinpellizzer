                    <h1>Tillandsia fusiformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fusiformis, commonly known as the fusiform air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique structure consists of a tall, narrow rosette of leaves that form a central cup to collect water. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia fusiformis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
