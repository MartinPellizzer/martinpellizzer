<p>Tamarix weyleri, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces pink or reddish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Tamarix weyleri is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
