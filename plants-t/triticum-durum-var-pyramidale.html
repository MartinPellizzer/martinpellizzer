<p>Triticum durum var. pyramidale, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard kernels.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for the production of semolina, which is used in pasta and other food products. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a tough, inedible hull, which is removed during processing to produce the usable grain.</p>
