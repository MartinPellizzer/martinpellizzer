                    <h1>Trifolium siskiyouense</h1>
<p>Trifolium siskiyouense, commonly known as Siskiyou clover, is a rare flowering plant native to the Siskiyou Mountains in Oregon and California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
