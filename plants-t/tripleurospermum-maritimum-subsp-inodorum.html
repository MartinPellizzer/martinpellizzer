<p>Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>inodorum, commonly known as the coastal cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its lack of a strong scent, distinguishing it from other members of the genus.</p>
