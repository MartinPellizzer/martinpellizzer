                    <h1>Tragacantha pyrrhotricha</h1>
<p>Tragacantha pyrrhotricha, commonly known as the red thorned tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered with sharp, reddish spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pods containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha pyrrhotricha is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum arabic.</p>
