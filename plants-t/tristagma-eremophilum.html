<p>Tristagma eremophilum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
