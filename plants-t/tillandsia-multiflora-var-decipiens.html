<p>Tillandsia multiflora var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it an ideal candidate for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
