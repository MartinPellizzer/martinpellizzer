                    <h1>Triodia concinna</h1>
<p>Triodia concinna, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of mallee and spinifex grasslands. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
<p>Triodia concinna is also valued for its use in traditional Aboriginal practices and as a component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
