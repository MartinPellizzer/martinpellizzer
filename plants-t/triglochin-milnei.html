                    <h1>Triglochin milnei</h1>
<p>Triglochin milnei, commonly known as the coastal marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its root system helps stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>Triglochin milnei is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
