<p>Tragacantha microphysa, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus microphysa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience in harsh environments, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
