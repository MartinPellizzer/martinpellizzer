<p>Trisetum flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>alpestre, commonly known as Alpine false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
