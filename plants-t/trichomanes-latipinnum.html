<p>Trichomanes latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-needle huperbole, is a fern belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes latipinnum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range.</p>
