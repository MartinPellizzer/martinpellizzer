<p>Taraxacum latens, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous yellow flower. The plant produces a capsule that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Taraxacum latens is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments.</p>
