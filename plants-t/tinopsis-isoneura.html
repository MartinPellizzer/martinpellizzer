<p>Tinopsis isoneura, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries.

It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can have both positive and negative effects on the health of its host tree.</p>
