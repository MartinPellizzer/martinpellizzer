<p>Tragacantha scleropodia, commonly known as the desert thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, globular fruits containing seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Tragacantha scleropodia plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
