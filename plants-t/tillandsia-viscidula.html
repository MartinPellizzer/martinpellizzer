                    <h1>Tillandsia viscidula</h1>
<p>Tillandsia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a dense, sticky coating that helps it retain moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue.</p>
<p>Tillandsia viscidula is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
