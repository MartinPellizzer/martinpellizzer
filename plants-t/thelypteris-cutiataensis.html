<p>Thelypteris cutiataensis, commonly known as the Cuitiata fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
