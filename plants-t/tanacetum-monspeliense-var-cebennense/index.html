<p>Cicely-leaved tansy, scientifically known as Tanacetum monspeliense var. cebennense, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the cypress plant, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its bright yellow flowers appear in late summer, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies.</p>
