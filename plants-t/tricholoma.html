<p>Tricholoma, commonly known as the webcap mushrooms, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, often web-like caps and gilled structures. Many species within this genus are found in temperate regions, growing in association with various tree species.
