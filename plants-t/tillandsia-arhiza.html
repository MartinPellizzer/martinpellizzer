                    <h1>Tillandsia arhiza</h1>
<p>Tillandsia arhiza, commonly known as the silver vane airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its dense, silver-white foliage rather than through roots. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps capture and retain water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color.</p>
