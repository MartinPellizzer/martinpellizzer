<p>Triticum timopheevii subsp.</p>
<p>militinae, commonly known as the military rye, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for breeding with cultivated rye varieties.</p>
