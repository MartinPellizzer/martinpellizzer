<p>Triticum aestivum subsp.</p>
<p>compactum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. It is primarily cultivated for its high yield potential and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant typically exhibits a two-row spike with small, hard grains that are rich in gluten. Its genetic makeup is closely related to other wheat subspecies, making it valuable in breeding programs for improved agronomic traits.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and productivity, it is widely used in both temperate and subtropical regions for grain production.</p>
