<p>Trichocentrum candidum, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, appearing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum candidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
