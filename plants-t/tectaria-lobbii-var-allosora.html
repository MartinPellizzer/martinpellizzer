<p>Tectaria lobbii var. allosora, commonly known as the allosora shield fern, is a variant of the Tectaria lobbii species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
