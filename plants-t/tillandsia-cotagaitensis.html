                    <h1>Tillandsia cotagaitensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cotagaitensis, commonly known as the Cotagaita air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
