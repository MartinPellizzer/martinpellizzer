                    <h1>Tetrapterys crispa var. subcordata</h1>
<p>Tetrapterys crispa var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
