                    <h1>Trichophyllum</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids that anchor it to substrates. The leaves are typically small, elongated, and have a hairy or woolly texture, giving the plant its common name. Trichophyllum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>These plants play a role in soil stabilization and contribute to the ecological diversity of their habitats.</p>
