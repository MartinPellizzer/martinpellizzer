                    <h1>Thalictrum minus var. saxatile</h1>
<p>Thalictrum minus var. saxatile, commonly known as the rock meadow rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky habitats, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form of Thalictrum minus and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
