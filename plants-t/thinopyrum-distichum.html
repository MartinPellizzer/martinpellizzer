<p>Thinopyrum distichum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Thinopyrum distichum is also valued for its potential in agricultural research due to its genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
