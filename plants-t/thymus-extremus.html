                    <h1>Thymus extremus</h1>
<p>Thymus extremus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thymus extremus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its aromatic compounds make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses.</p>
