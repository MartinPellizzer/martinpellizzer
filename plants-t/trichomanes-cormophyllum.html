                    <h1>Trichomanes cormophyllum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes cormophyllum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of its evolutionary lineage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its structure includes a short, underground stem known as a rhizome, which supports the growth of its foliage.</p>
<p>Trichomanes cormophyllum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem biodiversity.</p>
