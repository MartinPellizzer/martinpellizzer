<p>Thelypteris limbata, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
