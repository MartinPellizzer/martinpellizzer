<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped fronds that emit a faint golden glow under certain light conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
