<p>Tillandsia secunda, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking purple or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical regions.</p>
