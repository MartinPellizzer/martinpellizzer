                    <h1>Thornbera dalea</h1>
<p>Thornbera dalea, commonly known as the dwarf thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Thornbera dalea is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
