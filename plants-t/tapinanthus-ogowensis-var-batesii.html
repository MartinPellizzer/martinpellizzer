                    <h1>Tapinanthus ogowensis var. batesii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus ogowensis var. batesii, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
