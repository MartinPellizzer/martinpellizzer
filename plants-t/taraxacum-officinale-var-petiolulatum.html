<p>Taraxacum officinale var. petiolulatum, commonly known as the spoonleaf dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, though it has been introduced to other regions. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are elongated and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and produce a capsule containing numerous seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
