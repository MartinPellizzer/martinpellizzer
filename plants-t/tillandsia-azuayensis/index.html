                            <h1>Tillandsia Azuayensis</h1>
<p>Azuay air plant, scientifically known as Tillandsia azuayensis, is a rare and intriguing species of air plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. This unique plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure and striking silver-green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Azuay air plant is considered a delicately balanced species in its ecosystem. Conservation efforts are increasingly important to protect this rare and beautiful plant from threats such as deforestation and climate change.</p>
