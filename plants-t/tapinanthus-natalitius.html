                    <h1>Tapinanthus natalitius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus natalitius, commonly known as the Natal ghost orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to trees in the genus *Erythrophleum*. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique growth habit and limited distribution make it a rare and specialized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
