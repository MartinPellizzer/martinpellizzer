                    <h1>Tamarix nilotica var. anisandra</h1>
<p>Tamarix nilotica var. anisandra, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, saline soils. Its roots can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
