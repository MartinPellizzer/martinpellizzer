                    <h1>Taxillus sechellensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus sechellensis, commonly known as the Sechellean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily the ebony (Diospyros) species, through a specialized root system called haustoria. The plant derives some of its nutrients and water from the host, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds dispersed by birds, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
