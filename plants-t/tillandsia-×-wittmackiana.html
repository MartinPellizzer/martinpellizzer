                    <h1>Tillandsia × wittmackiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × wittmackiana, commonly known as the silver vase or queen of the air, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, allowing it to efficiently collect moisture from the air. The plant lacks traditional roots for absorbing water and instead relies on its leaves to trap humidity and nutrients. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
