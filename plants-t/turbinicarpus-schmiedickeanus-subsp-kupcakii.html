<p>Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp.</p>
<p>kupcakii, commonly known as the Kupcakii Turbinated Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to yellowish spines. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
