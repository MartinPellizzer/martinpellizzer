                    <h1>Telephiastrum</h1>
<p>Telephiastrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, both of which are shrubs with small, pale flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Telephiastrum is considered a rare and specialized botanical species.</p>
