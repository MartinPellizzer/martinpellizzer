                    <h1>Thuja curviramea</h1>
<p>Thuja curviramea, commonly known as the twisted cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, twisted growth pattern and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in its native habitat. Its cones are small and berry-like, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Thuja curviramea is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
