                    <h1>Thelypteris pilossissima</h1>
<p>Thelypteris pilossissima, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous shield.</p>
