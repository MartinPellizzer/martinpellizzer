<p>Triticum rimpaui, commonly known as the Rampaui wheat, is a lesser-known species within the wheat genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescence, typical of many grasses. The plant produces small, glume-less florets that are often clustered in dense spikes. It is native to certain regions of Asia and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is not widely used in global agriculture but remains of interest for genetic research.</p>
