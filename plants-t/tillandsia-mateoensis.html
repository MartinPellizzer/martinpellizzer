                    <h1>Tillandsia mateoensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia mateoensis, commonly known as the Mateo's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical collections.</p>
