                    <h1>Timonius amungwiwanensis</h1>
<p>Timonius amungwiwanensis, commonly known as the Amungwiwanensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-like leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
