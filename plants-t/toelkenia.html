<p>Toelkenia, commonly known as the silver leaf or desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their slender, often deciduous stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically small, opposite, and sometimes hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Toelkenia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
