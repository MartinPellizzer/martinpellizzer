                    <h1>Thamnosma crenata</h1>
<p>Thamnosma crenata, commonly known as the coastal thamnosma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal bluffs and dunes, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Thamnosma crenata is an important component of coastal plant communities and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value.</p>
