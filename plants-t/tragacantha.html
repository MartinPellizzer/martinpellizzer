                    <h1>Tragacantha</h1>
<p>Tragacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, particularly thriving in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The most economically significant species, Tragacantha lutea, produces a resinous gum known as tragacanth, which has been used for centuries in medicine, food, and industry.</p>
<p>This gum is harvested from the plant's stem and is valued for its thickening and binding properties.</p>
