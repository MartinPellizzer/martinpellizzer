                    <h1>Trifolium tomentosum var. orientale</h1>
<p>Trifolium tomentosum var. orientale, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, covered with a dense, woolly pubescence that gives it a distinctive gray-green appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for soil enrichment.</p>
