                    <h1>Thymus fallax var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Thymus fallax var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme varieties.</p>
