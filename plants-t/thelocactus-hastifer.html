<p>Thelocactus hastifer, commonly known as the goat's horn cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Thelocactus hastifer is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
