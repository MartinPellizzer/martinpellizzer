                    <h1>Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureopenicillatus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus lagopus var. aureopenicillatus, commonly known as the golden penstemon cactus, is a rare and unique variant of the tephrocactus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of spiny, woolly stems that provide protection from herbivores and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
