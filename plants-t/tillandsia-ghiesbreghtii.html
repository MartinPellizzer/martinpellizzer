                    <h1>Tillandsia ghiesbreghtii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
