                    <h1>Thalictrum baicalense f. levicarpum</h1>
<p>Thalictrum baicalense f. levicarpum, commonly known as the Baikal meadow rue, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its habitat is primarily limited to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Baikal area of Russia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
