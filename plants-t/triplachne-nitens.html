<p>Triplachne nitens, commonly known as slender triplachne, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Triplachne nitens is considered a weed in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
