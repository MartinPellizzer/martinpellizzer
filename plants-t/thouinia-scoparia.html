                    <h1>Thouinia scoparia</h1>
<p>Thouinia scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. Its leaves are hairy and succulent, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Thouinia scoparia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
