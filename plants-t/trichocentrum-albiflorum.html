<p>Trichocentrum albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers with yellow lips. Its leaves are elongated and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum albiflorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth.</p>
