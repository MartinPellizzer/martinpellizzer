                    <h1>Trifolium repens var. cultum</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens var. cultum, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This trait makes it valuable in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture.</p>
