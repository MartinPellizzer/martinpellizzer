                    <h1>Taraxacum proclinatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum proclinatum, commonly known as the proclined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that is shorter than typical dandelions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
