<p>Tillandsia permutata, commonly known as the silver vane tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it is an epiphyte, growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
