                    <h1>Tillandsia crispa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia crispa, commonly known as the curly air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is characterized by long, narrow, and curling leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Tillandsia crispa is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight.</p>
