<p>Trichopilia gracilis, commonly known as the slender trichopilia, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partially to fully shaded conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Trichopilia gracilis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
