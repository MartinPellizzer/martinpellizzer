                    <h1>Taraxacum phalarocephalum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum phalarocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears a flowering head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
