                    <h1>Tschulaktavia saxatilis</h1>
<p>Tschulaktavia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on exposed rock surfaces, where it can withstand extreme conditions such as high temperatures and low moisture. Its growth is slow, and it plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>The structure of Tschulaktavia saxatilis is often crust-like, adhering tightly to the substrate it colonizes.</p>
