                    <h1>Tristagma nivale f. australe</h1>
<p>Tristagma nivale f. australe, commonly known as the southern snowbell, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the alpine regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and helps reduce heat absorption. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
