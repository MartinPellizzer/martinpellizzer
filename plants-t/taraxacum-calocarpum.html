                    <h1>Taraxacum calocarpum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum calocarpum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a spherical, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
