                    <h1>Triticum durum var. ferereichenbachii</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. ferereichenbachii, commonly known as Ferereichenbachii durum wheat, is a rare variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique genetic traits.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinct morphological features, including its compact growth habit and specific spike morphology. It exhibits a high level of genetic diversity, making it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience. The plant's botanical characteristics include tough, straw-colored grains and a shorter stalk compared to standard durum wheat.</p>
<p>Its rarity and genetic uniqueness contribute to its significance in both agricultural research and conservation efforts.</p>
