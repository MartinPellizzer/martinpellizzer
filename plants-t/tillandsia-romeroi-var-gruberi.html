                    <h1>Tillandsia romeroi var. gruberi</h1>
<p>Tillandsia romeroi var. gruberi, commonly known as the Gruber's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
