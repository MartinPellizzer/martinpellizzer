                    <h1>Trichodium alpinum var. flavidum</h1>
<p>Trichodium alpinum var. flavidum, commonly known as the yellow moss cushion, is a rare and specialized plant found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, yellowish-green leaves that are tightly packed, forming a compact structure that helps retain moisture in harsh conditions. It thrives in high-altitude regions with low temperatures and high UV exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
