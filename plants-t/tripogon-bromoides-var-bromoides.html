<p>Tripogon bromoides var. bromoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
