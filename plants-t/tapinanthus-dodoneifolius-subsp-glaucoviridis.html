<p>Tapinanthus dodoneifolius subsp.</p>
<p>glaucoviridis, commonly known as the glaucous leaf dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its glaucous, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees, in its native range of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
