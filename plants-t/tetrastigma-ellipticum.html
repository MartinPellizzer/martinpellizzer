<p>Tetrastigma ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic crossvine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
