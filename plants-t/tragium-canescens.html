                    <h1>Tragium canescens</h1>
<p>Tragium canescens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Tragium canescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
