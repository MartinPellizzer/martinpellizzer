<p>Tectaria zeilanica, commonly known as the Zeilanica shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
