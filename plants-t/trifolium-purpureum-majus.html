                    <h1>Trifolium purpureum-majus</h1>
<p>Trifolium purpureum-majus, commonly known as the greater purple clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a prominent white or purple vein. The plant produces small, clustered purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is used in agricultural settings.</p>
