                    <h1>Tillandsia oblivata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia oblivata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a bromeliad native to the tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
