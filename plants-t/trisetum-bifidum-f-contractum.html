<p>Trisetum bifidum f. contractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a compact, perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Trisetum bifidum. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and habitat creation.</p>
