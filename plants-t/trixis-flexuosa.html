                    <h1>Trixis flexuosa</h1>
<p>Trixis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible trixis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Trixis flexuosa is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
