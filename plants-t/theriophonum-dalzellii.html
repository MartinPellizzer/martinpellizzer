                    <h1>Theriophonum dalzellii</h1>
<p>Theriophonum dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its unique common name. The plant has a very short flowering period, typically occurring during the dry season, and relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by a specialized insect, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Theriophonum dalzellii is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
