                    <h1>Tilingia tachiroei</h1>
<p>Tilingia tachiroei, commonly known as the Tachiroe's tilingia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tilingia tachiroei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
