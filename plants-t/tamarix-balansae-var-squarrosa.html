<p>Tamarix balansae var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikes and attract pollinators. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to saline soils, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
