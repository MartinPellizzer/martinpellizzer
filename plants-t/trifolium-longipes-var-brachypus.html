The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, typical of the genus Trifolium.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
