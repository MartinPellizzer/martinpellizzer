                    <h1>Tubella todziae</h1>
<p>Tubella todziae, commonly known as the Todziae tubular sponge, is a unique marine sponge found in shallow tropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Tubellaria and is characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure. The sponge's surface is covered with small, finger-like projections called stereopyles, which aid in filter feeding. It thrives in environments with strong water currents, allowing it to capture planktonic organisms efficiently.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its simple yet effective structure, reflecting the evolutionary adaptations of sponges to aquatic life.</p>
