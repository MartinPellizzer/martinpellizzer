<p>Tripleurospermum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Its resilience to maritime conditions makes it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects.</p>
