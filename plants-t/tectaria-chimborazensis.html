<p>Tectaria chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo tectaria, is a species of fern native to the Andean region of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often hairy underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
