<p>Tecticornia auriculata, commonly known as the silver leaf saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Tecticornia auriculata is well adapted to saline soils and is often used in revegetation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
