                    <h1>Tillandsia zahnii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zahnii, commonly known as the Zahnii air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
