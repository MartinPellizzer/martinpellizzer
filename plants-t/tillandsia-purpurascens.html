                    <h1>Tillandsia purpurascens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia purpurascens, commonly known as the Purple-tinged Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purplish hue. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
