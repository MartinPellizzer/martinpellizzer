<p>Tassadia manarae, commonly known as the Manarae tasselflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, branching stems that often form dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Tassadia manarae is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered an important component of its local ecosystem.</p>
