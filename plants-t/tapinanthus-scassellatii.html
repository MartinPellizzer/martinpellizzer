                    <h1>Tapinanthus scassellatii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus scassellatii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in disturbed habitats and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host.</p>
