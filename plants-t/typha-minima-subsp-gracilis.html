<p>Typha minima subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers present on the same spike, a feature known as gynostemony.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
