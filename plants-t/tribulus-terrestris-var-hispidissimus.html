                    <h1>Tribulus terrestris var. hispidissimus</h1>
<p>Tribulus terrestris var. hispidissimus, commonly known as goathead, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiny, triangular seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
