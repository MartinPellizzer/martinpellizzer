                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. hybernum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. hybernum, commonly known as hard red winter wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its high protein content and hard grain.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated in temperate climates and is well-suited for colder growing conditions. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that contain multiple small, oval-shaped grains. Its roots are fibrous and extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its use in bread-making due to its strong gluten content and robust dough characteristics.</p>
