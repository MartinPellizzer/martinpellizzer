                    <h1>Tricostularia</h1>
<p>Tricostularia, commonly known as the three-ribbed lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a crust-like, foliose, or fruticose growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Tricostularia species are typically found on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
