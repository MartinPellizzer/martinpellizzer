<p>Tephrocactus yanganucensis, commonly known as the Yanganucensis cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to a specific region in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is typically solitary or in small clusters, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
