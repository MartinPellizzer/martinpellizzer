                    <h1>Tillandsia andreettae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
