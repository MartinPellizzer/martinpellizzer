<p>Trifolium echinatum subsp.</p>
<p>serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
