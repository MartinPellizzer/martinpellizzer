                    <h1>Thermophila rugulosa</h1>
<p>Thermophila rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved thermophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
