<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that curl inward when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are yellow with purple veins, and they bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Tragopogon tortilis is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
