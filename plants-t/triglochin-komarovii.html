                    <h1>Triglochin komarovii</h1>
<p>Triglochin komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>Triglochin komarovii is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
