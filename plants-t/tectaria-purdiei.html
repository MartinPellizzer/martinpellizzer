                    <h1>Tectaria purdiei</h1>
<p>Tectaria purdiei, commonly known as the Pukaki fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium.</p>
<p>Tectaria purdiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
