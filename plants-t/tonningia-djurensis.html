                    <h1>Tonningia djurensis</h1>
<p>Tonningia djurensis, commonly known as the Cape coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal associations with fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on the trunks of trees in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and delicate species requiring specific care in cultivation.</p>
