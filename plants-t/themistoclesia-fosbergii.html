                    <h1>Themistoclesia fosbergii</h1>
<p>Themistoclesia fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches to its host trees, primarily pines, through a specialized structure called a haustellum, which allows it to draw water and nutrients. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
