                    <h1>Tradescantia paludosa</h1>
<p>Tradescantia paludosa, commonly known as marsh spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that produce clusters of small, three-petaled, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
