                    <h1>Triticum flexum</h1>
<p>Triticum flexum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets per spikelet.</p>
<p>While not a major crop, it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties.</p>
