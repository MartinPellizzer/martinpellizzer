                    <h1>Tecticornia fontinalis</h1>
<p>Tecticornia fontinalis, commonly known as the small-flowered glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats where it thrives in high-sodium conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils.</p>
<p>Tecticornia fontinalis is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb and tolerate high levels of salt.</p>
