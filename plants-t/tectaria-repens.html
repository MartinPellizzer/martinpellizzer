                    <h1>Tectaria repens</h1>
<p>Tectaria repens, commonly known as the creeping tectaria, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing a dense mat of foliage. The fronds are typically pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to spread vegetatively makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
