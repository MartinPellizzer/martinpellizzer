<p>Telestria, commonly known as the "moonflower," is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by dawn, adapting to low-light conditions. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its growth habit is typically vine-like, with long, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground.</p>
<p>The botanical name *Telestria* reflects its unique nocturnal blooming behavior, which is a remarkable adaptation to its environment.</p>
