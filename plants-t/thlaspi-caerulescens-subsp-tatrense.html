<p>Thlaspi caerulescens subsp.</p>
<p>tatrense, commonly known as the Tatran Alpine Cabbage, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and bluish-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
