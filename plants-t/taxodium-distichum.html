                    <h1>Taxodium distichum</h1>
<p>Taxodium distichum, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive feather-like leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and pests.</p>
<p>The bald cypress is often found in wetland areas, where its extensive root system helps prevent erosion.</p>
