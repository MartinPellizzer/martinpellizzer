                    <h1>Trixis glutinosa</h1>
<p>Trixis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky trixis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Trixis glutinosa is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
