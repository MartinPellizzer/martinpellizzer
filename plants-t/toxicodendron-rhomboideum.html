                    <h1>Toxicodendron rhomboideum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron rhomboideum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a rhomboid shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
