                    <h1>Typha × argoviensis</h1>
<p>Typha × argoviensis, commonly known as the hybrid cattail, is a wetland plant that results from the cross between Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that contains both male and female inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Typha × argoviensis plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
