                    <h1>Tephroseris salisburgensis</h1>
<p>Tephroseris salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tephroseris salisburgensis is also notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
