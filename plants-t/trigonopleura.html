                    <h1>Trigonopleura</h1>
<p>Trigonopleura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, and its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Trigonopleura thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
