                    <h1>Tillandsia geniculata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia geniculata, commonly known as the curly leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, curling leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, making it well-suited for hanging or epiphytic displays. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom from the center of the rosette and are relatively short-lived.</p>
<p>Tillandsia geniculata is relatively easy to care for, requiring regular misting and indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
