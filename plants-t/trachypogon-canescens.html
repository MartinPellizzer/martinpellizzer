                    <h1>Trachypogon canescens</h1>
<p>Trachypogon canescens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, hairy texture of its leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Trachypogon canescens is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
