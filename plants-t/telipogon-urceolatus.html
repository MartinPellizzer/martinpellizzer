                    <h1>Telipogon urceolatus</h1>
<p>Telipogon urceolatus, commonly known as the urn-shaped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flower that resembles a small vase, with a striking combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered blooms that are pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon urceolatus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
