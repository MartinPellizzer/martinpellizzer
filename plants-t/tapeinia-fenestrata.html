                    <h1>Tapeinia fenestrata</h1>
<p>Tapeinia fenestrata, commonly known as the windowed smut, is a fungal plant pathogen that primarily affects grasses.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Ustilaginales and is characterized by its unique, window-like structures on the infected plant tissue. The fungus produces spores within the galls that form on the stems and leaves of its host plants. These spores are dispersed by wind and can infect new hosts during the growing season.</p>
<p>Tapeinia fenestrata is an important pathogen in agricultural and ecological studies due to its impact on grassland ecosystems.</p>
