                    <h1>Tillandsia scalarifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia scalarifolia, commonly known as the scalycush tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia scalarifolia produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
