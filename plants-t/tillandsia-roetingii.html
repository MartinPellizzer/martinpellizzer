                    <h1>Tillandsia roetingii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia roetingii, commonly known as the Roetingii air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
