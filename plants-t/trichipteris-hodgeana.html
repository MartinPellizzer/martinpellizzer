<p>Trichipteris hodgeana, commonly known as the Hodge's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce small, delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The fronds are typically light green and emerge from the water's surface in a rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
