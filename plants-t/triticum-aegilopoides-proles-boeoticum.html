                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides proles boeoticum</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides proles boeoticum, commonly known as Boeotian grass or Boeotian wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic proximity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
