                    <h1>Thymus herba-barona var. mabilleanus</h1>
<p>Thymus herba-barona var. mabilleanus, commonly known as the Mabillean thyme, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of thyme native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, small, gray-green leaves that emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
