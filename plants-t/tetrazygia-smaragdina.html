                    <h1>Tetrazygia smaragdina</h1>
<p>Tetrazygia smaragdina, commonly known as the Emerald Ctenanthe, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy, emerald-green surface. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a white spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Tetrazygia smaragdina is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
