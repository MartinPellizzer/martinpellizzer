                    <h1>Tillandsia latifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Tillandsia latifolia var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety.</p>
