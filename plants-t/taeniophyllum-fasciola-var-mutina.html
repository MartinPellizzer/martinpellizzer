                    <h1>Taeniophyllum fasciola var. mutina</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum fasciola var. mutina, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
