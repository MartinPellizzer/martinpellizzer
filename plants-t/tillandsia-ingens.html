                    <h1>Tillandsia ingens</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ingens, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, capable of trapping moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces offsets that can be separated to propagate new plants.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ingens is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
