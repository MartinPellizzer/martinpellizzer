                    <h1>Trapa natans var. borysthenica</h1>
<p>Trapa natans var. borysthenica, commonly known as the Eurasian watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has whorled leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a broad, flat blade and a narrow, thread-like stalk. The plant produces small, floating flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, altering water ecosystems and outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
