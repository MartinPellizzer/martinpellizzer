<p>Tarachia laciniata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are typically short and branching, and it is often found growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Tarachia laciniata is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
