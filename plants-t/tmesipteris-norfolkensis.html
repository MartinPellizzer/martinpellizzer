<p>Tmesipteris norfolkensis, commonly known as the Norfolk fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the island of Norfolk in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
