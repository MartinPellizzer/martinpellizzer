                    <h1>Tillandsia geminiflora var. geminiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia geminiflora var. geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It produces striking clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
