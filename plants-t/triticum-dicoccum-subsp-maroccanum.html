<p>Triticum dicoccum subsp.</p>
<p>maroccanum, commonly known as Moroccan emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with narrow, bluish-green leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. Its grains are smaller and harder than those of modern wheat varieties, with a high protein content.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers for its potential in developing drought-resistant and nutrient-rich cereal crops.</p>
