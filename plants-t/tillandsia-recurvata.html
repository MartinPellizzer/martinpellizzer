                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata, commonly known as the silver vulture orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance needs, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
