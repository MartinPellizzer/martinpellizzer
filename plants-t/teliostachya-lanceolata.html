<p>Teliostachya lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild rye, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and drought-resistant characteristics. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to thrive in low-nutrient, high-sunlight environments.</p>
