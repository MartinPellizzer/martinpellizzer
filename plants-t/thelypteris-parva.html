                    <h1>Thelypteris parva</h1>
<p>Thelypteris parva, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with clustered, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact size and attractive foliage.</p>
