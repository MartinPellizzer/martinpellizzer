                    <h1>Triticum vulgare convar. spelta</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare convar. spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its hollow stems and spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets, which eventually develop into awned grains. Spelt grains are typically longer and more slender compared to modern wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup includes a mix of wild and domesticated traits, contributing to its unique nutritional profile and resilience to environmental stress.</p>
