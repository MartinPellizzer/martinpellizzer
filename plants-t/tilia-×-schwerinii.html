                    <h1>Tilia × schwerinii</h1>
<p>Tilia × schwerinii, commonly known as the whitebeam or small-leaf lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Tilia × schwerinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit.</p>
