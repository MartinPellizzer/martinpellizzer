                    <h1>Tragacantha pygmaea</h1>
<p>Tragacantha pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf tragacanth, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
