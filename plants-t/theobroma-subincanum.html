<p>Theobroma subincanum, commonly known as the wild cocoa tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain bitter, inedible seeds, which are not used for chocolate production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and genetic diversity, it is of interest for conservation and breeding programs.</p>
