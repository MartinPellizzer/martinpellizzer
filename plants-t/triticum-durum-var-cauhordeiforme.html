                    <h1>Triticum durum var. cauhordeiforme</h1>
<p>Triticum durum var. cauhordeiforme, commonly known as durum wheat with a cauhordeiforme variant, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits a distinctive seed shape and structure, which can influence its agronomic performance and end-use properties. It belongs to the Poaceae family, sharing the typical grass plant characteristics such as hollow stems and parallel-veined leaves. The cauhordeiforme variant is notable for its specific growth habits and may possess traits of interest for breeding programs.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to understanding genetic diversity within wheat species.</p>
