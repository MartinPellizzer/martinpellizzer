                    <h1>Tapinanthus preussii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus preussii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including Ethiopia and Sudan. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are alternate and often heart-shaped, while its stems are vine-like and can climb or trail along the ground.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus preussii is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display.</p>
