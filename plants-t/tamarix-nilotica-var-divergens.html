                    <h1>Tamarix nilotica var. divergens</h1>
<p>Tamarix nilotica var. divergens, commonly known as the African tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink to red flowers in summer, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
