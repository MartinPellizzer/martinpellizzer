                    <h1>Triglochin neozelandica</h1>
<p>Triglochin neozelandica, commonly known as New Zealand arrowgrass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Triglochin neozelandica is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
