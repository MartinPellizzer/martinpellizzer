<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Thelypteris kunzei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
