                    <h1>Triticum alatum</h1>
<p>Triticum alatum, commonly known as the winged wheat, is a unique grass species characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on the glumes of its spikelets.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often adorned with lateral bracts resembling wings, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, Triticum alatum is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental features and potential for genetic research.</p>
