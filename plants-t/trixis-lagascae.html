                    <h1>Trixis lagascae</h1>
<p>Trixis lagascae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Trixis lagascae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
