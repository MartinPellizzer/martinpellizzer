<p>Toxicodendron orientale subsp.</p>
<p>orientale, commonly known as the oriental lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of lacquer, though its sap can cause dermatitis in humans.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Anacardiaceae family, sharing similar botanical features.</p>
