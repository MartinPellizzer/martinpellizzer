                    <h1>Tillandsia roezlii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia roezlii, commonly known as the RÃ¶sel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia roezlii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
