<p>Trochocarpa involucrata, commonly known as the desert globe-mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive globular, yellowish-green inflorescences that resemble small globes, which are surrounded by a dense, woolly involucrum. The plant has small, palmate leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Trochocarpa involucrata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals.</p>
