                    <h1>Tragacantha armata</h1>
<p>Tragacantha armata, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem, which exudes a milky latex when damaged, and its compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tragacantha armata is valued for its resin, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a binding agent in various applications.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
