                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. arnuruciru-claviformum</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. arnuruciru-claviformum, commonly known as the Arnuruciru-claviformum wheat, is a rare and specialized variant of common wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique glume morphology, featuring elongated, claviform (club-shaped) structures that distinguish it from standard wheat varieties. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Its botanical features suggest adaptations to specific environmental conditions, possibly arid or high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to researchers studying genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications in challenging climates.</p>
