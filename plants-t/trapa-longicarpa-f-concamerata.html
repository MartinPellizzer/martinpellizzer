                    <h1>Trapa longicarpa f. concamerata</h1>
<p>Trapa longicarpa f. concamerata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged stems that bear spiny fruits. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are distinctive, with a spiny outer layer that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche in freshwater habitats.</p>
