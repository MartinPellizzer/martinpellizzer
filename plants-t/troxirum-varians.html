                    <h1>Troxirum varians</h1>
<p>Troxirum varians, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant's structure consists of a thick, fleshy stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
