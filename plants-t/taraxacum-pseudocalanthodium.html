                    <h1>Taraxacum pseudocalanthodium</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pseudocalanthodium, commonly known as the golden bur dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive, spiky seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces a milky sap when damaged.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
