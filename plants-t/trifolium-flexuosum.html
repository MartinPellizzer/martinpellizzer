                    <h1>Trifolium flexuosum</h1>
<p>Trifolium flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Trifolium flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
