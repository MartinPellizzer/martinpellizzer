                    <h1>Tapinanthus rugegensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus rugegensis, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
