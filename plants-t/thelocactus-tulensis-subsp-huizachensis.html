<p>Thelocactus tulensis subsp.</p>
<p>huizachensis, commonly known as the Huizachense Thelocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
