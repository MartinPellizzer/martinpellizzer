                            <h1>Tragacantha Schahrudensis</h1>
<p>Schahrud tragacanth, scientifically known as Tragacantha schahrudensis, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. This unique species belongs to the legume family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and thick, fibrous pods. Despite its limited geographic range, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Schahrud tragacanth is currently listed as a vulnerable species by conservation organizations. Its conservation status highlights the need for further research and protection efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
