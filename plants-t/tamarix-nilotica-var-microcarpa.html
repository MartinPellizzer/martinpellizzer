                    <h1>Tamarix nilotica var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Tamarix nilotica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
