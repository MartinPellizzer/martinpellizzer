<p>Safflower, scientifically known as Tragacantha solandri, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is valued for its vibrant yellow and red blooms, which have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and dyeing practices. The plant produces seeds that are widely used in the food and cosmetic industries due to their high oil content. Its versatility and historical significance make it an important crop in many agricultural systems. Safflower continues to play a key role in both cultural traditions and modern applications.</p>
