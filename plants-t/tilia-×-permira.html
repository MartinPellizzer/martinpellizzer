                    <h1>Tilia × permira</h1>
<p>Tilia × permira, commonly known as the European linden or lime tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, round fruits called samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade.</p>
<p>Tilia × permira is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
