                    <h1>Trichosorus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Trichosorus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and a bluish-green coloration due to the presence of specialized pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its small, closely packed leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often-dry habitats.</p>
<p>Trichosorus glaucescens plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its ecological niche.</p>
