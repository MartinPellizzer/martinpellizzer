                    <h1>Trichachne patens</h1>
<p>Trichachne patens, commonly known as the spreading trichachne, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Trichachne patens is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a common component of dryland vegetation.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance in degraded landscapes.</p>
