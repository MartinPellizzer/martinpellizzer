                    <h1>Tripolium linnaeanum</h1>
<p>Tripolium linnaeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
