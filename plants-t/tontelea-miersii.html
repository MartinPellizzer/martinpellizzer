<p>Tontelea miersii, commonly known as the Miers' tontelea, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tontelea miersii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
