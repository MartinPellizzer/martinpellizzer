<p>Tinus adenanthera, commonly known as the Natal ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>The wood of Tinus adenanthera is highly valued for its strength and durability, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
