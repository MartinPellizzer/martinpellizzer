                    <h1>Tamarix chinensis</h1>
<p>Tamarix chinensis, commonly known as Chinese tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, often pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species in dry regions.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, though it can become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
