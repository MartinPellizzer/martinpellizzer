                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. garniense</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. garniense, commonly known as the Armenian wheat or wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the evolution of domesticated wheat species.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its potential role in crop improvement programs due to its genetic diversity.</p>
