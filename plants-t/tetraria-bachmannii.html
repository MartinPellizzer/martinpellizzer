                    <h1>Tetraria bachmannii</h1>
<p>Tetraria bachmannii, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its unique thallus structure.</p>
<p>It forms a crustose growth on rocky surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's body consists of a dark, leathery layer with a dense, interwoven network of hyphae. It lacks true leaves, stems, or roots, relying instead on photosynthesis through its symbiotic association with algae.</p>
<p>Tetraria bachmannii is commonly found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
