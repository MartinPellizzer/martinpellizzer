<p>Teucrium myriocladum, commonly known as desert germander, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually purple or blue in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Teucrium myriocladum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
