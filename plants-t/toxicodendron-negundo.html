<p>Toxicodendron negundo, commonly known as the boxelder tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into three to nine leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by samaras with three winged seeds. It is often found in moist soils near streams and rivers, and it can grow in a variety of habitats, including urban environments.</p>
