<p>Thapsia nestleri subsp. lainzii is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its elegant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf structure, making it a prized addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
