<p>Trichocentrum viridulum, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Trichocentrum viridulum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
