                    <h1>Tillandsia cyathiformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cyathiformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect water. Its leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and can develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tillandsia cyathiformis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive.</p>
