<p>Thelocactus smithii, commonly known as the Smith's thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its botanical features make it well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with a deep root system and succulent tissues for water storage.</p>
<p>Thelocactus smithii is a rare and unique plant, often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
