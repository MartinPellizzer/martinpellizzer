                    <h1>Tapinanthus muerensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus muerensis, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses or other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
