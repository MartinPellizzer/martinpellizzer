                    <h1>Tereianthes fruticosa</h1>
<p>Tereianthes fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tereianthes fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
