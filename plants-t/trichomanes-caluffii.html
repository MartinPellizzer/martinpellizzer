                    <h1>Trichomanes caluffii</h1>
<p>Trichomanes caluffii, commonly known as the Caluffi's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichomanes caluffii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
