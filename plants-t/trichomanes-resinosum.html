<p>Trichomanes resinosum, commonly known as the resinous holly fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Trichomanes resinosum is noted for its slow growth and is often considered a living relic from the Mesozoic era.</p>
