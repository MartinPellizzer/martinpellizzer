                    <h1>Tillandsia pernambucensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pernambucensis, commonly known as the Pernambuco air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pernambucensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
