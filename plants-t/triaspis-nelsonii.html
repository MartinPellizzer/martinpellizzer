<p>Triaspis nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's triaspis, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces clusters of tiny, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Triaspis nelsonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
