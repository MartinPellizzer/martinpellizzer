<p>Torulinium harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's torula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
