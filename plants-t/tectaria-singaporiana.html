                    <h1>Tectaria singaporiana</h1>
<p>Tectaria singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective operculum.</p>
