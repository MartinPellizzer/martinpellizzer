<p>Taraxacum pseudoproximum, commonly known as the Alaska dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-covered seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum pseudoproximum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and has a slow growth rate due to its harsh environmental conditions.</p>
