                    <h1>Trifolium subterraneum var. flagelliforme</h1>
<p>Trifolium subterraneum var. flagelliforme, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its elongated, creeping stems that allow it to spread rapidly across the ground.</p>
