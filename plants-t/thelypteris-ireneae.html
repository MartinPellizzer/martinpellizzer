<p>Thelypteris ireneae, commonly known as the Irene's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris ireneae is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
