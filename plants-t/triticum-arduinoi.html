<p>Triticum arduinoi, commonly known as Arduino wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species of wheat.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique genetic makeup, which includes traits that may offer potential for agricultural improvement. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a compact growth habit. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to researchers in plant genetics and crop diversity.</p>
