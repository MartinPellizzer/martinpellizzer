                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. vysozkyi</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. vysozkyi, commonly known as Vysozky's compact wheat, is a botanical variant characterized by its compact growth habit and semi-domesticated status.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant exhibits a unique combination of wild and cultivated traits, making it of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and genetic diversity. Its grains are typically small and hard, with a high protein content, contributing to its potential use in breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
