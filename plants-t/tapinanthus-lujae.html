                    <h1>Tapinanthus lujae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, thread-like stems that缠绕 (twine) around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of showy petals. It is native to arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
