                    <h1>Tapinanthus triplinervius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus triplinervius, commonly known as the three-veined dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. It is native to Africa and is often found parasitizing various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
