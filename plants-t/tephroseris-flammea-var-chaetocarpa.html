                    <h1>Tephroseris flammea var. chaetocarpa</h1>
<p>Tephroseris flammea var. chaetocarpa, commonly known as the flamebrush lichen, is a foliose lichen with a distinctive orange to reddish-orange thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a complex structure with a layered cortex and a medulla composed of fungal hyphae and algal cells. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are formed on the upper surface and aid in dispersal.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its vibrant coloration and ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
