                    <h1>Temburongia simplex</h1>
<p>Temburongia simplex, commonly known as the Singapore tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the lowland rainforests of Singapore.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree with simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical treasure.</p>
