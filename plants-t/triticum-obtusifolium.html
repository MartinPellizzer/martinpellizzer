                    <h1>Triticum obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Triticum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short stature and broad, bluntly shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its seeds are typically small and can be harvested for use in traditional or experimental bread-making.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to common wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement.</p>
