                    <h1>Trichomanes johnstonense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes johnstonense, commonly known as Johnston's huperzia, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
