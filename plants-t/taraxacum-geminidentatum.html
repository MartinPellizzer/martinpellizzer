<p>Taraxacum geminidentatum, commonly known as the twin-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its leaves have a distinctive arrangement of two small teeth at the tip, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
<p>The plant is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
