                    <h1>Tillandsia decomposita var. minor</h1>
<p>Tillandsia decomposita var. minor, commonly known as the lesser decomposing air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation in humid environments.</p>
