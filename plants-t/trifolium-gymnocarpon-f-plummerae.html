                    <h1>Trifolium gymnocarpon f. plummerae</h1>
<p>Trifolium gymnocarpon f. plummerae, commonly known as the slender clover, is a variant of the genus Trifolium, characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and smaller leaflets compared to other Trifolium species.</p>
