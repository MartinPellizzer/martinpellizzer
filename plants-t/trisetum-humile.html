                    <h1>Trisetum humile</h1>
<p>Trisetum humile, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, tufted blades with a dense, grass-like appearance, often forming mats on moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to wet or waterlogged environments, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trisetum humile is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
