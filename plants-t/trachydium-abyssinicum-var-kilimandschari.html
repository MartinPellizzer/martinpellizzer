The plant produces striking, spire-like inflorescences with pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
