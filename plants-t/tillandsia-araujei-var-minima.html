                    <h1>Tillandsia araujei var. minima</h1>
<p>Tillandsia araujei var. minima, commonly known as the miniature tillandsia, is a small epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
