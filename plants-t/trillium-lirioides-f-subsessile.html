                    <h1>Trillium lirioides f. subsessile</h1>
<p>Trillium lirioides f. subsessile, commonly known as the short-stemmed white trillium, is a rare and delicate woodland plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and a single, nodding white flower with six tepals. The subsessile form distinguishes itself by having a very short pedicel, making the flower appear nearly stemless. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich forest soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
