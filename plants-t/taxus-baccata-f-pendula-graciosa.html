<p>Taxus baccata f. pendula-graciosa, commonly known as the weeping and graceful yew.</p>
<p>This ornamental variant of the European yew exhibits a distinctive weeping habit with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect.

It produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>The plant is slow-growing and requires well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes where its unique form can be appreciated.</p>
