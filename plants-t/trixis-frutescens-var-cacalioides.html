                    <h1>Trixis frutescens var. cacalioides</h1>
<p>Trixis frutescens var. cacalioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, gray-green foliage that is covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in semi-arid landscapes.</p>
