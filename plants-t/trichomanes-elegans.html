<p>Trichomanes elegans, commonly known as the elegant huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
