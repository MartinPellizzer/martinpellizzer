                    <h1>Taxillus rhododendricola</h1>
<p>Taxillus rhododendricola, commonly known as the mistletoe of rhododendrons, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host, typically rhododendrons.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new hosts. It forms dense clusters on the host's branches, often leading to the weakening or death of the host plant over time.</p>
<p>Taxillus rhododendricola is commonly found in temperate forests, particularly in regions with high humidity and suitable host species.</p>
