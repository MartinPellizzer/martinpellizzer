                    <h1>Thunia pulchra</h1>
<p>Thunia pulchra, commonly known as the fairy shrimp, is a small aquatic crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>However, it is often found in temporary pools and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of water, and it is sensitive to environmental changes. The species is notable for its translucent, shrimp-like appearance and short lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for wetland health.</p>
