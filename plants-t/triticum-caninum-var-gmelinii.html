                    <h1>Triticum caninum var. gmelinii</h1>
<p>Triticum caninum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. Its grains are smaller than those of common wheat and have a higher fiber content.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ancient agricultural systems.</p>
