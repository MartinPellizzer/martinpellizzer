<p>Tripogon lanatus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
