<p>Thelycrania darvasica, commonly known as the Darvasic thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Thelycrania darvasica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional use in local herbal medicine.</p>
