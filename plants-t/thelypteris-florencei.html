<p>Thelypteris florencei, commonly known as Florence's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color and a slightly hairy underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris florencei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
