                    <h1>Tillandsia orizabensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia orizabensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
