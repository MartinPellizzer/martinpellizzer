                    <h1>Taxus cuspidata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Taxus cuspidata var. latifolia, commonly known as the Japanese yew or broadleaf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Taxus cuspidata, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, columnar growth habit.</p>
