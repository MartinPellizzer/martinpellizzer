<p>Tripsacum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically greenish to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to maize and teosinte, contributing to its historical significance in the development of cultivated corn.</p>
