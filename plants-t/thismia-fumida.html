                    <h1>Thismia fumida</h1>
<p>Thismia fumida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated flower spike. The plant produces small, white, urn-shaped flowers that emit a faint, ghostly glow in the dark. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
