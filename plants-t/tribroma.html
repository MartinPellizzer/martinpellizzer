                    <h1>Tribroma</h1>
<p>Tribroma, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Triuridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Tribroma species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where they thrive in humid conditions. The plant's name is derived from the Greek words "tribos" meaning friction and "kheir" meaning hand, possibly referring to the way its leaves move or the texture of its foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tribroma is considered a lesser-known but ecologically significant plant in certain regions.</p>
