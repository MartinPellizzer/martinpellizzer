                    <h1>Thymelaea hirsuta var. rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Thymelaea hirsuta var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed thymelaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, rounded leaves that are densely covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its rounded leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of Thymelaea hirsuta.</p>
