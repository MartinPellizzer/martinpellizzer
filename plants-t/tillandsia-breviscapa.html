<p>Tillandsia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks without requiring soil. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical collections.</p>
