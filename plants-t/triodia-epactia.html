                    <h1>Triodia epactia</h1>
<p>Triodia epactia, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, wiry, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Triodia epactia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna.</p>
