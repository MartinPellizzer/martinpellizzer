<p>Thelypteris ovata, commonly known as the ovate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are arranged in a single row along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris ovata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
