                    <h1>Tulbaghia calcarea</h1>
<p>Tulbaghia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone tulbaghia, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat.</p>
<p>Tulbaghia calcarea is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
