<p>Thelypteris fairbankii, commonly known as the Fairbank's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Thelypteris fairbankii is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
