<p>Tessaranthium radiatum, commonly known as the radiant starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, silver-green leaves with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of violet and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Tessaranthium radiatum thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental value have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
