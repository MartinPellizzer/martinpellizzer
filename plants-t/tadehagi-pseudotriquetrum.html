                    <h1>Tadehagi pseudotriquetrum</h1>
<p>Tadehagi pseudotriquetrum, commonly known as false crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soil conditions and makes it a common invasive species in disturbed areas. It is often found in roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment but also contributes to its competitive nature in natural habitats.</p>
