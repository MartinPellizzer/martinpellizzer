                    <h1>Thelypteris celebornii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris celebornii, commonly known as the Celeborn holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris celebornii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings.</p>
