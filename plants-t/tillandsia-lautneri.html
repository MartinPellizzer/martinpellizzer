                    <h1>Tillandsia lautneri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lautneri, commonly known as the Lautner's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its foliage forms a rosette structure that collects rainwater, providing hydration for the plant.</p>
<p>Tillandsia lautneri is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
