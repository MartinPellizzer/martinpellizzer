<p>Tillandsia sessemocinoi, commonly known as the Serrate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slight blue or purple tint. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia sessemocinoi is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate watering.</p>
