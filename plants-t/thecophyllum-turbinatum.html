<p>Thecophyllum turbinatum, commonly known as the turbinated lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus that is typically crustose to foliose, with a yellowish to orange-brown upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algal partner being primarily Trebouxiophyceae. It is often found growing on rocks, soil, or tree bark in humid, temperate regions.</p>
<p>Thecophyllum turbinatum is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
