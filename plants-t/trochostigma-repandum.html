<p>Trochostigma repandum, commonly known as the wandering bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
