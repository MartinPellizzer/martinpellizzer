                    <h1>Trilepis abyssinica</h1>
<p>Trilepis abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian thornveld, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Trilepis abyssinica is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
