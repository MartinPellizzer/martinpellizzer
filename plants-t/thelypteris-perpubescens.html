<p>Thelypteris perpubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it its common name and help protect it from desiccation. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern.</p>
<p>Thelypteris perpubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
