<p>Thelocactus saussieri, commonly known as the Saussure's thorn cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and sharp, spiny ribs that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the spring. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Thelocactus saussieri is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
