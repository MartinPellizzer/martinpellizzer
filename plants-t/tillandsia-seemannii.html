                    <h1>Tillandsia seemannii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia seemannii, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia seemannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
