                    <h1>Tillandsia buchtienii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
