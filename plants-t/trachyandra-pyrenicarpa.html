<p>Trachyandra pyrenicarpa, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
