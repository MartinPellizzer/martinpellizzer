<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged body structure and a flexible, tunic-like outer covering. This organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its reproductive system involves the production of both eggs and sperm, which are released into the water for external fertilization.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in marine ecosystems, it serves as an important food source for various marine species.</p>
