                    <h1>Tillandsia gardneri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to purple, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and aesthetic value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
