                    <h1>Trixis frutescens</h1>
<p>Trixis frutescens, commonly known as the desert thornbush, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Trixis frutescens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
