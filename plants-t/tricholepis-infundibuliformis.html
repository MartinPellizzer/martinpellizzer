                    <h1>Tricholepis infundibuliformis</h1>
<p>Tricholepis infundibuliformis, commonly known as the hooded lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, cup-like or hooded shape.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, temperate forest environments. The thallus is composed of a dense, leathery layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algae or cyanobacteria. Its color ranges from pale yellowish-green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
