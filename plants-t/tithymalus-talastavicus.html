<p>Tithymalus talastavicus, commonly known as the Talastavicus tithymal, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are typically yellow or orange in color, surrounded by a ring of petal-like structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
