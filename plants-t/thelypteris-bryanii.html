<p>Thelypteris bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris bryanii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
