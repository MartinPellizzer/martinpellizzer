                    <h1>Thesium glaucum</h1>
<p>Thesium glaucum, commonly known as the blue thesium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by seed capsules. Thesium glaucum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitats.</p>
