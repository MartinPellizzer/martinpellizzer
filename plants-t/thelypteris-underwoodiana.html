<p>Thelypteris underwoodiana, commonly known as the Underwood's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
