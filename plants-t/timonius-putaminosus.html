<p>Timonius putaminosus, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the roots of trees or in rocky crevices. Its small, clustered flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
