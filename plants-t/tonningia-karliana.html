                    <h1>Tonningia karliana</h1>
<p>Tonningia karliana, commonly known as the Karliana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature and specialized growth habits make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tonningia karliana is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
