                    <h1>Tillandsia zonata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia zonata, commonly known as the Zonate Airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
