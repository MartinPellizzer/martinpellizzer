                    <h1>Trichonema bulbocodium var. purpurascens</h1>
<p>Trichonema bulbocodium var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered bulbous orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bulbous rhizomes and its unique inflorescence of resupinate, showy flowers that range from purple to pink in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
