<p>Thelypteris superba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in waterlogged soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps attract small aquatic organisms that serve as its primary food source.</p>
