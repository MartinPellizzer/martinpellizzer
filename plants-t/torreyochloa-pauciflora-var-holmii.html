                    <h1>Torreyochloa pauciflora var. holmii</h1>
<p>Torreyochloa pauciflora var. holmii, commonly known as the Holm's sparseflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its low growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
