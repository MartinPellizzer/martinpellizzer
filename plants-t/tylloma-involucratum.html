                    <h1>Tylloma involucratum</h1>
<p>Tylloma involucratum, commonly known as the woolly bladder nut, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bladder-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
