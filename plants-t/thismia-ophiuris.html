                    <h1>Thismia ophiuris</h1>
<p>Thismia ophiuris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nourishment. Its flowers are small, white, and highly specialized, adapted for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
