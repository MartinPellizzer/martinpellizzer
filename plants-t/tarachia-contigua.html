<p>Tarachia contigua, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming growth habit, typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tarachia contigua is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
