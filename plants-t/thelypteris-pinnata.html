<p>Thelypteris pinnata, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions across the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Thelypteris pinnata produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
