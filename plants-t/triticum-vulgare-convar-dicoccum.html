                    <h1>Triticum vulgare convar. dicoccum</h1>
<p>Triticum vulgare convar. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, tough grains that are tightly adhered to the chaff, making it difficult to separate from the husk. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are rich in protein and have been cultivated for thousands of years for both food and flour.</p>
<p>Emmer wheat is considered a precursor to modern wheat varieties and is still used in traditional baking and brewing.</p>
