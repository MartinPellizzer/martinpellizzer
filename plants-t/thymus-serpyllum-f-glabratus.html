                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. glabratus</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. glabratus, commonly known as smooth thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs in typical thyme varieties, though this form is notable for its smoother foliage. The plant produces small pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, lemony fragrance, which is less intense than that of common thyme.</p>
