                    <h1>Tutuca fistulosa</h1>
<p>Tutuca fistulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers. The plant produces a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinator, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. It contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Tutuca fistulosa is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
