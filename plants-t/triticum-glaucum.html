                    <h1>Triticum glaucum</h1>
<p>Triticum glaucum, commonly known as the blue wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue-green glumes that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are generally smaller and less productive compared to cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
<p>Triticum glaucum is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
