                    <h1>Tonningia cucullata</h1>
<p>Tonningia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic moss-like plant belonging to the family Pinnataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, ribbon-like leaves that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on submerged or damp surfaces. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures, which are covered in microscopic pores. It is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins.</p>
<p>Tonningia cucullata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
