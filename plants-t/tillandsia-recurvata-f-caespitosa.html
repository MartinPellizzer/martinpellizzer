                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata f. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata f. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features a compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
