<p>Tillandsia wagneriana, commonly known as the Wagner's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
