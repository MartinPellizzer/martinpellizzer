                    <h1>Tisonia coriacea</h1>
<p>Tisonia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned tisonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Tisonia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
