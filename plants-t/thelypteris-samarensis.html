<p>Thelypteris samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Thelypteris samarensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small fauna.</p>
