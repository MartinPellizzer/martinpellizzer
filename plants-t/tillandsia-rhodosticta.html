                    <h1>Tillandsia rhodosticta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rhodosticta, commonly known as the red-streaked air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia rhodosticta produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange bracts, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
