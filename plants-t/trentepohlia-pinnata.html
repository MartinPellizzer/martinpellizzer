                    <h1>Trentepohlia pinnata</h1>
<p>Trentepohlia pinnata, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green coloration due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of specialized structures called thallus. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Trentepohlia pinnata is often found in forest floors and rocky areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
