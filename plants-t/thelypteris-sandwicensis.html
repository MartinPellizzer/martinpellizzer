                    <h1>Thelypteris sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Thelypteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a species of fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow at night. This unique trait is due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase, which facilitate light production. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various invertebrates and its cultural importance to Native Hawaiian traditions.</p>
