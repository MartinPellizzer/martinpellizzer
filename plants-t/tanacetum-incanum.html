<p>Tanacetum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish flower heads that resemble those of other members of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Tanacetum incanum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
