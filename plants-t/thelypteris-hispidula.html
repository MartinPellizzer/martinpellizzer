<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense covering of fine, soft hairs that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
