<p>Thelypteris mauensis, commonly known as the Mau fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
