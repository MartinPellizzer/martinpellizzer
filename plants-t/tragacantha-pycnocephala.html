<p>Tragacantha pycnocephala, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, woody crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its most notable feature is the production of a thick, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a natural gum.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in dry, hot climates with minimal water availability.</p>
