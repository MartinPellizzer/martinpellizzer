                    <h1>Taxillus cuneatus</h1>
<p>Taxillus cuneatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large sections of its host, sometimes leading to the weakening or death of the tree. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Taxillus cuneatus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and sustenance to various animal species.</p>
