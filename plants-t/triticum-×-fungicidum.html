                    <h1>Triticum × fungicidum</h1>
<p>Triticum × fungicidum, commonly known as the hybrid wheat-fungicide plant, is a synthetic hybrid resulting from the cross between wheat (Triticum aestivum) and a fungal species.</p>
<p>This unique plant exhibits traits from both parental species, combining the agricultural utility of wheat with the biological properties of fungi. Its botanical structure includes the typical grass-like morphology of wheat, with modified fungal characteristics in its cellular composition. The hybrid is of interest in biotechnology for its potential applications in biopesticides and genetic research.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation is limited due to the challenges in stabilizing its genetic makeup and ensuring ecological safety.</p>
