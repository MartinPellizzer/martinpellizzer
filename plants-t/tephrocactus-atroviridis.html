<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often concealed by its spines. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus atroviridis is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
