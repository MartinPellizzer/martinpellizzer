                    <h1>Taraxacum longii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum longii, commonly known as the long-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and a distinctive, tall, yellow flower head that appears in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with feathery parachutes, facilitating wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
