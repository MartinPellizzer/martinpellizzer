                    <h1>Triticum durum f. trevesium</h1>
<p>Triticum durum f. trevesium, commonly known as the hard wheat intermediate form, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its intermediate growth habit and morphology.</p>
<p>It exhibits traits that bridge the gap between traditional durum wheat and other wheat species, making it a subject of interest in breeding programs. The plant typically features semi-dwarf stems, shorter spike lengths, and a more compact structure compared to standard durum wheat. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a high concentration of protein in its grains, which contribute to its agricultural significance.</p>
<p>This form is often studied for its potential in improving drought resistance and yield stability in wheat cultivation.</p>
