                    <h1>Teratophyllum aculeatum var. montanum</h1>
<p>Teratophyllum aculeatum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, waxy, and often spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
