<p>Tillandsia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Tillandsia goyazensis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation for optimal health.</p>
