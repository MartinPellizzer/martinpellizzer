                    <h1>Taraxacum hultenii</h1>
<p>Taraxacum hultenii, commonly known as Hult√©n's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This perennial herb is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces seeds with pappus, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Taraxacum hultenii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
