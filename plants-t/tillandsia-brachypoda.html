                    <h1>Tillandsia brachypoda</h1>
<p>Tillandsia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage forms a rosette that traps moisture, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, showy inflorescences with white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when cultivated.</p>
