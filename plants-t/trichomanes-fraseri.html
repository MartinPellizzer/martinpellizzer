                    <h1>Trichomanes fraseri</h1>
<p>Trichomanes fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's maidenhair, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices where moisture is retained. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes fraseri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
