                    <h1>Tryphostemma stolzii</h1>
<p>Tryphostemma stolzii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tryphostemma stolzii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
