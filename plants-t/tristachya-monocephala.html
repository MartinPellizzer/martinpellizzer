<p>Tristachya monocephala, commonly known as the giant reed or swamp reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tristachya monocephala is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
