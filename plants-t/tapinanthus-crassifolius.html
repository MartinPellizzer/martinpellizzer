                    <h1>Tapinanthus crassifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle where it germinates and attaches to a host plant using haustoria. The plant is native to Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
