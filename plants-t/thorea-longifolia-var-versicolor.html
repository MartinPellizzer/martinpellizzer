                    <h1>Thorea longifolia var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Thorea longifolia var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable threadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a wide range of color variations in its thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, especially in humid and shaded environments, and is found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere. The plant's thallus is characterized by its thin, leaf-like structure and the presence of distinct, elongated lobes. Its coloration can range from pale green to yellowish or reddish, depending on environmental conditions and seasonal changes.</p>
<p>This variation in appearance contributes to its common name and makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
