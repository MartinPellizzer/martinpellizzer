                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides var. albonigrum</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides var. albonigrum, commonly known as the black wheatgrass, is a diploid wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescence with small, dark-colored grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its genome is relatively small compared to other wheat species, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs.</p>
<p>This variety is also noted for its potential in forage and as a model for studying wheat genetics.</p>
