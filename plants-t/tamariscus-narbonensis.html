                    <h1>Tamariscus narbonensis</h1>
<p>Tamariscus narbonensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
