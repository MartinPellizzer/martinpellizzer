                    <h1>Triodia avenacea var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Triodia avenacea var. pygmaea, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clumps with wiry, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system enables it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range.</p>
