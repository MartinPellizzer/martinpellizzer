<p>Tulestea koulamoutouensis, commonly known as the Koulamoutou endemic, is a rare plant species native to the Central African rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
