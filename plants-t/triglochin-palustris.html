                    <h1>Triglochin palustris</h1>
<p>Triglochin palustris, commonly known as marsh arrowgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to moist or submerged conditions, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Triglochin palustris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
