                    <h1>Tortula</h1>
<p>Tortula, commonly known as the rock moss, is a genus of small, leafy liverworts that thrive in moist, rocky environments.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate regions, often growing on soil, stones, or tree bark. Tortula species are characterized by their simple, closely packed leaves and their ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience, they are often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
