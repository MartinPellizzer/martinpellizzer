                    <h1>Tetraneuris linearifolia var. arenicola</h1>
<p>Tetraneuris linearifolia var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
