<p>Triticum dicoccon, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a grass with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with small, hard grains that are typically wind-pollinated. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>However, it is not cultivated for grain production due to its lower yield and poor grain quality compared to domesticated wheat varieties.</p>
