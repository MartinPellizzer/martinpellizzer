                    <h1>Tapinanthus lecomtei</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia or Euphorbia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like appearance with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments where its host plants thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
