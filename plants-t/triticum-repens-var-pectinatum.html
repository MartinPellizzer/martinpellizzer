                    <h1>Triticum repens var. pectinatum</h1>
<p>Triticum repens var. pectinatum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small,颖果-like grains that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
