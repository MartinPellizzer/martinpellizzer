                    <h1>Typha albida</h1>
<p>Typha albida, commonly known as the white cattail, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that transitions from green to white as it matures. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically found in dense clusters at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Typha albida plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
