                    <h1>Tapinanthus inaequilaterus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus inaequilaterus, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive without requiring extensive root systems, making it well adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
