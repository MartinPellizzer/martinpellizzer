                    <h1>Taxillus nigrans var. rhododendricola</h1>
<p>Taxillus nigrans var. rhododendricola, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of rhododendrons and other evergreen trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of China and is often found in mountainous areas with dense evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host trees, making it an important ecological factor in its habitat.</p>
