                    <h1>Tapinanthus oehleri</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus oehleri, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, often with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
