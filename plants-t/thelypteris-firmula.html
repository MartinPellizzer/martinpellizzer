<p>Thelypteris firmula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored dust. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with fertile sori arranged in two rows along the margins of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Thelypteris firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
