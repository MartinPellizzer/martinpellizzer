                    <h1>Triticum comosum</h1>
<p>Triticum comosum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its resilience in various environments.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat varieties.</p>
