                    <h1>Triticum lachenalii</h1>
<p>Triticum lachenalii, commonly known as the Lachenal's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its grains are small and have a high protein content, making it potentially valuable for modern agriculture.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated and remains a subject of botanical and genetic study.</p>
