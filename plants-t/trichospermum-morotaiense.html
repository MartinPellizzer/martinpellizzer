<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are edible when ripe, though they are generally small and not widely cultivated for commercial use.</p>
