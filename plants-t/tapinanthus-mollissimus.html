                    <h1>Tapinanthus mollissimus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus mollissimus, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as acacias, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and is often found in dense, humid forests. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
