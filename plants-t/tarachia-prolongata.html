<p>Tarachia prolongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed tarahiki, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Tarachia prolongata is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments.</p>
