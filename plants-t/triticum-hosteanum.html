                    <h1>Triticum hosteanum</h1>
<p>Triticum hosteanum, commonly known as the Hungarian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution and wild relatives.</p>
