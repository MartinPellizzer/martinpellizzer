                    <h1>Toxicodendron gueinzii</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinzi poison ivy, is a shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with three leaflets, and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces clusters of red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and horticultural settings.</p>
