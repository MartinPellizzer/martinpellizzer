                    <h1>Trichipteris pastazensis</h1>
<p>Trichipteris pastazensis, commonly known as the Pastaza fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Trichipteris pastazensis is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
