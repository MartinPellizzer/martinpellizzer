                    <h1>Taxus baccata f. xanthocarpa</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited yew, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common yew.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow berries, which contrast with the usual red or orange hues of the species. The plant retains the typical evergreen foliage of Taxus baccata, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is typically found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique fruit coloration in horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
