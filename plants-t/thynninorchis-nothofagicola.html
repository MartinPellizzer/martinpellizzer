<p>It is closely associated with the Nothofagus genus, commonly referred to as southern beeches, and typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow.</p>
