                    <h1>Trichomanes perpusillum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes perpusillum, commonly known as the tiny maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
