                    <h1>Tibetiodes brachytricha</h1>
<p>Tibetiodes brachytricha, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and other parts of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
