                    <h1>Triticum thaoudar var. balansae</h1>
<p>Triticum thaoudar var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae wheat, is a rare and ancient wheat species native to the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender grains and is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is considered a wild relative of modern wheat, offering potential genetic resources for breeding programs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
