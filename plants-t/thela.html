                    <h1>Thela</h1>
<p>Thela, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to extreme environments. The plant's most striking feature is its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Thela produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
