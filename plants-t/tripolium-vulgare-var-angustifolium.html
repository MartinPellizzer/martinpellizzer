                    <h1>Tripolium vulgare var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Tripolium vulgare var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
