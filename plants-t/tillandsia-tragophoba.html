                    <h1>Tillandsia tragophoba</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tragophoba, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments where other plants cannot.</p>
