                    <h1>Tamarix laxa var. transcaucasica</h1>
<p>Tamarix laxa var. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found along coastal areas and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in degraded landscapes.</p>
