                    <h1>Tillandsia edithae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia edithae, commonly known as the Edith's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters at the base of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia edithae is well adapted to low-light conditions and can thrive with minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
