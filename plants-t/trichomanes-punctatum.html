<p>Trichomanes punctatum, commonly known as the punctate harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds with a distinctive pattern of dots and lines. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
