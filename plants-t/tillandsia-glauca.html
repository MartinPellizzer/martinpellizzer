                    <h1>Tillandsia glauca</h1>
<p>Tillandsia glauca, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it is an epiphyte, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with a striking blue or silver hue, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Tillandsia glauca is well-suited for indoor cultivation, provided it receives adequate light and regular misting.</p>
