<p>Tillandsia pendula, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, pendant leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pendula is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
