                    <h1>Trifolium subterraneum var. oxaloides</h1>
<p>Trifolium subterraneum var. oxaloides, commonly known as the oxalate clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along field margins.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its high oxalate content, which can make it potentially toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities.</p>
