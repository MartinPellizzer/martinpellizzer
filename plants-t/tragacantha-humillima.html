                    <h1>Tragacantha humillima</h1>
<p>Tragacantha humillima, commonly known as the dwarf tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to that of other tragacanth species, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
