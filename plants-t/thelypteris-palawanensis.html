<p>Thelypteris palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris palawanensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
