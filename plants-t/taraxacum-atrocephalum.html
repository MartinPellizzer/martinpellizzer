                    <h1>Taraxacum atrocephalum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum atrocephalum, commonly known as blackhead dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is native to parts of North America.</p>
