                    <h1>Tillandsia martinicensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to the Caribbean, particularly Martinique and nearby islands. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking violet or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
