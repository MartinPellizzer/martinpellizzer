                    <h1>Trichipteris infesta</h1>
<p>Trichipteris infesta, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Trichipteris infesta is considered endangered and is often found in conservation areas.</p>
