                    <h1>Thecophyllum balanophorum</h1>
<p>Thecophyllum balanophorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants but can photosynthesize to some extent. The plant lacks leaves and has a slender, white, and often translucent stem covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and emit a faint odor resembling rotting flesh to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
