                    <h1>Tapinanthus oedostemon</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus oedostemon, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to its host. It is native to Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
