                    <h1>Tillandsia pinnata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pinnata, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are usually orange or red, and it produces small, clustered fruits.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pinnata is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well-suited for humid environments.</p>
