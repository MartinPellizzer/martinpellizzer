                    <h1>Triticum turgidum var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum turgidum var. aristatum, commonly known as the wild wheat or slender wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged, with awns (bristle-like structures) that give it its common name. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions.</p>
