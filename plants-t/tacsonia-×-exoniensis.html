<p>Tacsonia × exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Tacsonia corymbosa and Tacsonia ramosissima.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the UK, particularly in the Exeter area, where it grows in coastal and maritime environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tacsonia × exoniensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
