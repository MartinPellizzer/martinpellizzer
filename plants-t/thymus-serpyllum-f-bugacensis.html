                    <h1>Thymus serpyllum f. bugacensis</h1>
<p>Thymus serpyllum f. bugacensis, commonly known as the Bugac thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian region of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.</p>
