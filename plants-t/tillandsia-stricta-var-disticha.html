<p>Tillandsia stricta var. disticha, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth and dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation to prevent rot. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardens.</p>
