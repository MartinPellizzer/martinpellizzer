<p>Tylecodon reticulatus, commonly known as the Netted Karkaraboo, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and branched stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tylecodon reticulatus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
