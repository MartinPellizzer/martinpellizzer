<p>Trieenea elsiae, commonly known as the Elsie's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Trieenea elsiae is critically endangered and listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>
