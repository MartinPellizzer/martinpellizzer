<p>Tillandsia pendulispica, commonly known as the pendant air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, pendant-like inflorescences that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Tillandsia pendulispica is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal soil, relying primarily on atmospheric moisture for sustenance.</p>
