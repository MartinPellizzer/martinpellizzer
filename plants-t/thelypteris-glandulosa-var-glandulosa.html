                    <h1>Thelypteris glandulosa var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris glandulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered with glandular hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
