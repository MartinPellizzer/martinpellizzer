<p>Trichoneura grandiglumis var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf trichoneura, is a rare grass species native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the main species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
