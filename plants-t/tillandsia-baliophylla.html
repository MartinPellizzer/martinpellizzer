                    <h1>Tillandsia baliophylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia baliophylla, commonly known as the Balinese air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
