<p>Trigonella corniculata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, kidney-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard Trigonella corniculata but is valued for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
