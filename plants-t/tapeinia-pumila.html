                    <h1>Tapeinia pumila</h1>
<p>Tapeinia pumila, commonly known as the wheat curl mite carrier, is a small, elongated plant pathogen that belongs to the order Eriophyidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily associated with cereal crops, particularly wheat, and plays a significant role in the transmission of wheat curl mite (Syringospora tritici). This organism lacks a true root system and instead attaches itself to the surface of its host plant, where it feeds on plant tissues. Its life cycle is closely linked to the growth stages of the host, often overwintering on crop residue.</p>
<p>Tapeinia pumila is an important factor in the epidemiology of wheat streak mosaic virus, contributing to the spread of plant diseases in agricultural settings.</p>
