                    <h1>Trillium recurvatum f. esepalum</h1>
<p>Trillium recurvatum f. esepalum, commonly known as the white-flowered trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the trillium genus native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals, which contrast with its deep green foliage, and its unique floral structure that resembles a three-petaled flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in rich, loamy soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three broad, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces a single, upright stem that supports its showy bloom.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
