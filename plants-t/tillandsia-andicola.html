                    <h1>Tillandsia andicola</h1>
<p>Tillandsia andicola, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia andicola is known for its ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
