                    <h1>Tetralix moaensis</h1>
<p>Tetralix moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its historical association with the extinct moa birds, it holds cultural and ecological significance in New Zealand's flora.</p>
