                    <h1>Trichomanes lofoushanense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes lofoushanense, commonly known as the Lufushan huperborean fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
