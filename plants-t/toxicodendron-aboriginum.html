                    <h1>Toxicodendron aboriginum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron aboriginum, commonly known as the indigenous poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
