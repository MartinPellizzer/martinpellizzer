                    <h1>Tarchonanthus litakunensis</h1>
<p>Tarchonanthus litakunensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well-suited for arid conditions.</p>
<p>Tarchonanthus litakunensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
