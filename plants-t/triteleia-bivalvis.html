<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its bulbs are adapted to survive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Triteleia bivalvis is often found in open woodland and coastal scrub habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
