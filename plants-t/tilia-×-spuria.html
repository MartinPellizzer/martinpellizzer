                    <h1>Tilia × spuria</h1>
<p>Tilia × spuria, commonly known as the common lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf lime) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf lime). The tree is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light grey when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
