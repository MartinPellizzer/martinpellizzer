<p>Trichoglottis kenchungianum, commonly known as the Kenchung orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
