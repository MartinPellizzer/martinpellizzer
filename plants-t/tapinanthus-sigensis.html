<p>Tapinanthus sigensis, commonly known as the Cape mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as acacia and eucalyptus, using a specialized haustellum to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Tapinanthus sigensis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
