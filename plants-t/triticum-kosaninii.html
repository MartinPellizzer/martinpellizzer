<p>Triticum kosaninii, commonly known as Kosanin's wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has achenes that are often covered in short hairs. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits a range of morphological variations.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
