<p>Triticum repens var. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted grass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils effectively.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
