                    <h1>Triglochin trichophora</h1>
<p>Triglochin trichophora, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as fens and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in waterlogged environments.</p>
<p>Triglochin trichophora plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
