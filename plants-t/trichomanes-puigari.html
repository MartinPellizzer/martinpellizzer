<p>Trichomanes puigari, commonly known as the Puigari fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in humid microhabitats. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a velvety texture, which helps in retaining moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes puigari is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
