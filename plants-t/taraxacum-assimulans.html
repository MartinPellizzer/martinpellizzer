                    <h1>Taraxacum assimulans</h1>
<p>Taraxacum assimulans, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head that resembles a dandelion, though it is smaller and less showy.</p>
<p>Taraxacum assimulans is often found in gardens and disturbed habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
