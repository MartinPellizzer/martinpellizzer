                    <h1>Taraxacum decrepitum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum decrepitum, commonly known as the brittle dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flowering head, which consists of numerous small florets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas.</p>
