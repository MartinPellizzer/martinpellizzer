                    <h1>Taraxacum holophyllum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum holophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often growing at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
