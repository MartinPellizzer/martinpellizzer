<p>Thoracostachyum longistylum f. parvum, commonly known as the dwarf thornapple, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
