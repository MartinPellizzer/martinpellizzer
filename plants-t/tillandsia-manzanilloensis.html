<p>Tillandsia manzanilloensis, commonly known as the Manzanillo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in areas with high humidity and indirect sunlight.</p>
