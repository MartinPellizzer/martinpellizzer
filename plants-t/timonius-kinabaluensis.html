                    <h1>Timonius kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Timonius kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu timonius, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
