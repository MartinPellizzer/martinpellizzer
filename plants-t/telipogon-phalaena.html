                    <h1>Telipogon phalaena</h1>
<p>Telipogon phalaena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon phalaena is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
