<p>Trichomanes pumilum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows close to the ground, often on rocks or in damp soil, and is found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, crescent-shaped clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Trichomanes pumilum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
