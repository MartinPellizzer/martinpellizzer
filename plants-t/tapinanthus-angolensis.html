                    <h1>Tapinanthus angolensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus angolensis, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily in the genus *Euphorbia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
