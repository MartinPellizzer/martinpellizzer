<p>Torularia adpressa, commonly known as the flat torula, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to those familiar crops. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers and produces yellowish fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
