                    <h1>Tilia × kuemmerlei</h1>
<p>Tilia × kuemmerlei, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the crossbreeding of Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden).</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal, adaptability to various soil types, and its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
