                    <h1>Thilcum</h1>
<p>Thilcum, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Thilcum is adapted to survive in harsh environments through its deep root system and water-storing leaves.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
