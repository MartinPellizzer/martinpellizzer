<p>Triticum turgidum subsp.</p>
<p>palaeocolchicum, commonly known as the ancient wheat or paleocolchicum wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and spikelets that bear small, pale florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the domestication of wheat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is considered a potential source of genetic diversity for modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
