                    <h1>Topobea parasitica</h1>
<p>Topobea parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic rock vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky substrates and is found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is adapted to penetrate the host's tissues, allowing it to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
