<p>Thelypteris tarningensis, commonly known as the Tarnung fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or spreading. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Thelypteris tarningensis is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
