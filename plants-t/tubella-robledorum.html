                    <h1>Tubella robledorum</h1>
<p>Tubella robledorum, commonly known as the Robledo's tube sponge, is a unique marine sponge characterized by its elongated, tubular body structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Astrophoridae and is notable for its intricate network of spongin fibers that provide structural support. The sponge's surface is covered with a dense layer of small, spiny projections called spicules, which aid in filtration and defense. It is typically found in shallow, coastal waters where it attaches to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, Tubella robledorum plays a significant role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and habitat complexity.</p>
