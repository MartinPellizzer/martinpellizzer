<p>Tragacantha nothoxys, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha nothoxys is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators.</p>
