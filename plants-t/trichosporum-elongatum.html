<p>Trichosporum elongatum, commonly known as the slender thread moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including the capsule, are borne on short, erect stalks, typical of many mosses.</p>
<p>Trichosporum elongatum plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its natural habitat.</p>
