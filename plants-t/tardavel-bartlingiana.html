<p>Tardavel bartlingiana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that rise from a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Tardavel bartlingiana is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
