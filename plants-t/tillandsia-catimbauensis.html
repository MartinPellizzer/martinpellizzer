                    <h1>Tillandsia catimbauensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia catimbauensis, commonly known as the Catimbauensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus.</p>
