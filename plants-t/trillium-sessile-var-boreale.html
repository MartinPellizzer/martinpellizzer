                    <h1>Trillium sessile var. boreale</h1>
<p>Trillium sessile var. boreale, commonly known as the northern sessile trillium, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors, often growing in rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
