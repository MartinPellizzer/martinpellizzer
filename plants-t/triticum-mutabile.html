                    <h1>Triticum mutabile</h1>
<p>Triticum mutabile, commonly known as the variable wheat, is a rare and enigmatic species of wheat that exhibits significant morphological variation.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes and spike structures. The plant's genetic diversity is believed to be a result of its isolated habitat and unique ecological conditions. It has been studied for its potential in agricultural research due to its adaptability and unusual traits.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains limited due to challenges in stabilizing its variable characteristics.</p>
