<p>Thelypteris yungensis, commonly known as the Yungense Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Thelypteris yungensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
