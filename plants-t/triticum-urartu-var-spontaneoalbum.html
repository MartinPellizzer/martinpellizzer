                    <h1>Triticum urartu var. spontaneoalbum</h1>
<p>Triticum urartu var. spontaneoalbum, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a diploid species native to the mountainous regions of the Near East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow grains and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genome contains a relatively simple structure, making it a valuable resource for genetic research.</p>
<p>This ancient grain is considered a progenitor of modern wheat varieties and holds significance in agricultural and evolutionary studies.</p>
