                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. khorramabadicum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. khorramabadicum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it adapt to arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in genetic research due to its potential for enhancing the resilience of cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
