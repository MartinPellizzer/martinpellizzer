                    <h1>Tephroseris</h1>
<p>Tephroseris, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. Tephroseris species are characterized by their compact, often cushion-like growth form, which helps them survive in harsh, dry environments. They produce small, showy flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
