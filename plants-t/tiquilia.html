                    <h1>Tiquilia</h1>
<p>Tiquilia, commonly known as the "Mexican star-of-Bethlehem," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Tiquilia species are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive blue or violet hue. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil.</p>
