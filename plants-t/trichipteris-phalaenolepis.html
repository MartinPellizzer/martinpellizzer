<p>Trichipteris phalaenolepis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Trichipteris phalaenolepis is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks, where it can access the moisture and light it requires for survival.</p>
