<p>Triphyllum, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique plant belonging to the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a saprophytic plant, meaning it derives its nutrients from decaying organic matter rather than through photosynthesis. Triphyllum typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and bogs. Its distinctive appearance includes a stemless, white or pale green stem with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or green, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
