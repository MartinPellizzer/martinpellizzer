<p>Tillandsia monobotrya, commonly known as the silver leaf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
