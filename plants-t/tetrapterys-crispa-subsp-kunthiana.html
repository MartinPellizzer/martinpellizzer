<p>Tetrapterys crispa subsp.</p>
<p>kunthiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
