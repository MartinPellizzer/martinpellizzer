                            <h1>Trifolium Repens Var. Prostratum</h1>
<p>Trifolium repens var. prostratum is a low-growing variant of white clover known for its dense, mat-like growth habit. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in lawns and pastures. Its prostrate form allows it to spread efficiently across the ground, forming a lush carpet of small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Despite its modest stature, this variety plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop.</p>
