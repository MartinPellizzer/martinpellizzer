                    <h1>Torrubia obtusata var. aberrans</h1>
<p>Torrubia obtusata var. aberrans, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
