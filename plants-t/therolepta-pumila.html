                    <h1>Therolepta pumila</h1>
<p>Therolepta pumila, commonly known as the dwarf forest fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, shaded environments such as forests and moist woodlands. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Therolepta pumila plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
