                    <h1>Tapinanthus albizziae</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus albizziae, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of Albizia species.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded forest understories.</p>
