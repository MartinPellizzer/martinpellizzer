                    <h1>Taxus baccata f. elegantissima</h1>
<p>Taxus baccata f. elegantissima, commonly known as the European yew with elegant foliage, is a cultivar of the yew tree characterized by its distinctive, finely textured leaves.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with a dense canopy of dark green, needle-like leaves that are narrower and more elongated than those of the typical European yew. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, though they are an important food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting in gardens.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature, suitable for both landscape and container cultivation.</p>
