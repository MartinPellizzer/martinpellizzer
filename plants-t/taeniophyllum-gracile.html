                    <h1>Taeniophyllum gracile</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum gracile, commonly known as the slender leaching fern, is a small, epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It relies on its host for moisture and nutrients, and its rhizomes help anchor it to the bark.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often overlooked in botanical studies.</p>
