                    <h1>Thymus glacialis</h1>
<p>Thymus glacialis, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Thymus glacialis is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a seasoning in cooking due to its aromatic properties.</p>
