<p>Thamnopteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically divided into small, delicate pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Thamnopteris orientalis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
