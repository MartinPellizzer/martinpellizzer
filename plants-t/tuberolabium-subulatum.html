                    <h1>Tuberolabium subulatum</h1>
<p>Tuberolabium subulatum, commonly known as the slender-lip orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a tuberous root system, which helps it survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinctive lip that is narrower than the other petals.</p>
<p>Tuberolabium subulatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils, growing in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
