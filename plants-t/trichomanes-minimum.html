<p>Trichomanes minimum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, circular groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes minimum is noted for its intricate and highly specialized morphology, which reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
