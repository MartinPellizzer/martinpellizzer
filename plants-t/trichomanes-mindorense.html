                    <h1>Trichomanes mindorense</h1>
<p>Trichomanes mindorense, commonly known as the Mindoro water fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Trichomanes mindorense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
