                    <h1>Thelypteris bonapartii</h1>
<p>Thelypteris bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
