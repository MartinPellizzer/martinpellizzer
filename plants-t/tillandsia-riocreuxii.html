                    <h1>Tillandsia riocreuxii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia riocreuxii, commonly known as the Rio Crecuxii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers.</p>
<p>Tillandsia riocreuxii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
