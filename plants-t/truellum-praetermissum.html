                    <h1>Truellum praetermissum</h1>
<p>Truellum praetermissum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, Truellum praetermissum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
