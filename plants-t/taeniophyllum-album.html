                    <h1>Taeniophyllum album</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum album, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leaf-like stems and small, pale white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of a leafless orchid. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
