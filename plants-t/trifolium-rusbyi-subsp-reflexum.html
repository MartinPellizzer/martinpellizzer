<p>Trifolium rusbyi subsp.</p>
<p>reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed clover, is a rare and specialized member of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
