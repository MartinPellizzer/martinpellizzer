<p>Tacazzea venosa subsp.</p>
<p>rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the Rosmarinus-like tacazzea, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, almost aromatic appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
