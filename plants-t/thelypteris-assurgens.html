<p>Thelypteris assurgens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on rocks and trees. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae with a serrated or toothed margin. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
