                    <h1>Topobea floribunda</h1>
<p>Topobea floribunda, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Topobea floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
