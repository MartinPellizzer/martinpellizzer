<p>Tillandsia latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>

Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
