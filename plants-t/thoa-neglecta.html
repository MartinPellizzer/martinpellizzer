                    <h1>Thoa neglecta</h1>
<p>Thoa neglecta, commonly known as the neglected thoa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thoa neglecta is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research.</p>
