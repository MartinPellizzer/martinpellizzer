                    <h1>Tessmannia burttii</h1>
<p>Tessmannia burttii, commonly known as the Tasmanian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches to its host tree, primarily eucalypts, through a specialized root system called a haustellum, which extracts water and nutrients. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
