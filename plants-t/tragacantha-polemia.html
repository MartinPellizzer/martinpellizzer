                    <h1>Tragacantha polemia</h1>
<p>Tragacantha polemia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is harvested for its use in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha polemia plays an important role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
