                    <h1>Trichophyllum intermedium var. habereri</h1>
<p>Trichophyllum intermedium var. habereri, commonly known as the Habereri trichophyllum, is a rare and unique species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, crustose thallus that forms a dense, leathery layer on rock surfaces, typically in moist, shaded environments. The lichen exhibits a pale to yellowish-green coloration, with a finely granular texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly on calcareous substrates, and is considered a specialist in terms of habitat requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
