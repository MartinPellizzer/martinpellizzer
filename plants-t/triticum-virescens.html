<p>Triticum virescens, commonly known as green wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and spikes of greenish-yellow florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as fields and rocky areas. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in association with other grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research.</p>
