<p>Tecoma lepidophylla, commonly known as the "desert candle," is a unique and resilient plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is famous for its striking, flame-like flowers that bloom in vibrant yellow or orange hues. This plant thrives in harsh desert environments, showcasing its ability to survive with minimal water. Its delicate, feather-like leaves and long, slender stems make it a striking addition to any landscape. Despite its fragile appearance, Tecoma lepidophylla is highly adapted to extreme conditions, making it a fascinating subject for ecological study.</p>
