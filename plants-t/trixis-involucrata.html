                    <h1>Trixis involucrata</h1>
<p>Trixis involucrata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy, green to blue-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Trixis involucrata is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its survival in extreme desert conditions, making it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
