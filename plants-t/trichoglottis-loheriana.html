<p>Trichoglottis loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's bryophytes, is a unique orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air circulation for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
