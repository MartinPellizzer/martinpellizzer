                    <h1>Tetranthera chrysantha var. glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Tetranthera chrysantha var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the golden glaucous fern, is a variant of the golden fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
