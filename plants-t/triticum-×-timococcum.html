                    <h1>Triticum × timococcum</h1>
<p>Triticum × timococcum, commonly known as the wheat-rye hybrid, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale).</p>
<p>It possesses a genome that combines the genetic material of both parent species, leading to a complex genetic makeup with 42 chromosomes. This hybrid is primarily of interest in plant breeding for its potential to introduce traits such as disease resistance and stress tolerance into wheat. However, it is not widely cultivated as a food crop due to its poor baking qualities and low yield.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, slender stalks and awned spikelets.</p>
