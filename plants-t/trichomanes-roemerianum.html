                    <h1>Trichomanes roemerianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes roemerianum, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichomanes roemerianum is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common epiphyte in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
