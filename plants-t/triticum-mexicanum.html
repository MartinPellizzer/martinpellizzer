                    <h1>Triticum mexicanum</h1>
<p>Triticum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican wheat, is a wild species native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to green florets. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a tough, bran-like coating.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential in genetic research and as a source of genetic diversity for modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
