                    <h1>Tecticornia</h1>
<p>Tecticornia, commonly known as the "desert grass" or "sand couch," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically low-growing and have narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to arid environments. Tecticornia species often feature dense, tufted growth forms that help reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. Their small, spikelet-based inflorescences are usually inconspicuous, with flowers that are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species that are used for erosion control and as forage in semi-arid regions.</p>
