                    <h1>Tillandsia tafiensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tafiensis, commonly known as the Tafiensis air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
