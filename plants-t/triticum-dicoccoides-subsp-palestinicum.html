<p>Triticum dicoccoides subsp.</p>
<p>palestinicum, commonly known as the Palestinian emmer wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is characterized by its compact, spiky inflorescence and small, hard grains that are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Levant region, including parts of modern-day Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. Its genome contains genetic diversity that is valuable for breeding programs aiming to improve drought tolerance and disease resistance in cultivated wheat.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid soils and has been historically used in traditional agricultural systems.</p>
