                    <h1>Tilia parvifolia var. columnaris</h1>
<p>Tilia parvifolia var. columnaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime or columnar linden, is a cultivar of the linden tree characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed compared to the typical Tilia parvifolia. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is well-suited for urban environments due to its compact form and tolerance to pollution.</p>
<p>This variety is often used as a ornamental tree in gardens and along streets.</p>
