<p>Thuja procera, commonly known as the Alberta spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive pyramidal shape with dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping and as a windbreak.</p>
<p>Thuja procera is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and air pollution.</p>
