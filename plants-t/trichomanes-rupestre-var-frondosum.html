                    <h1>Trichomanes rupestre var. frondosum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes rupestre var. frondosum, commonly known as the frondose rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it thrives in low-light, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often short and branched, anchoring it to substrates in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually green and may turn reddish or bronze in response to environmental stress.</p>
