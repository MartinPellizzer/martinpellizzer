                    <h1>Tetraria leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Tetraria leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited tetraria, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae and is typically found in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota phylum. Its fruiting bodies, called apothecia, are small and usually white or pale in color, with a smooth, often translucent cap.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of air quality.</p>
