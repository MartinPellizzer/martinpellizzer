                    <h1>Trichinium carnosum</h1>
<p>Trichinium carnosum, commonly known as the fatroot plant, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in less fertile soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Trichinium carnosum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use remains limited due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
