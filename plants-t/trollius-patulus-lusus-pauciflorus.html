<p>Trollius patulus lusus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered garden buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, showy flowers with numerous petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in meadows or along stream banks. It has palmately divided leaves that are hairy and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
