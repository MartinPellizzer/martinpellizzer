                    <h1>Tectaria porphyrocaulos</h1>
<p>Tectaria porphyrocaulos, commonly known as the purple-stemmed tectaria, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often brightly colored fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to humid climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
