<p>Tapinanthus stolzii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, with a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native flora.</p>
