                    <h1>Tillandsia walteri var. herrerae</h1>
<p>Tillandsia walteri var. herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
