                    <h1>Tetrapterys racemulosa</h1>
<p>Tetrapterys racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered leaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti.</p>
<p>Tetrapterys racemulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
