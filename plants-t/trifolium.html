                    <h1>Trifolium</h1>
<p>Trifolium, commonly known as clover, is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. Clover species are often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and they play a vital role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>They produce small, pea-like flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, and they are widely used as forage crops and in landscaping.</p>
