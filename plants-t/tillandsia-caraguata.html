                    <h1>Tillandsia caraguata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia caraguata, commonly known as the Caragu√° air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia caraguata is often cultivated as a decorative air plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
