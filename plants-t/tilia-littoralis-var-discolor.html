<p>Tilia littoralis var. discolor, commonly known as the white-barked maple, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and coastlines.</p>
