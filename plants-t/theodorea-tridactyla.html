                    <h1>Theodorea tridactyla</h1>
<p>Theodorea tridactyla, commonly known as the three-fingered lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
