                    <h1>Tapinanthus lukwangulensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwangulensis dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on its host for most of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is often found growing on the stems of other plants in forested or grassland habitats.</p>
