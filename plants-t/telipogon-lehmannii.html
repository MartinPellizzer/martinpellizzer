<p>Telipogon lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in regions with a temperate climate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Telipogon lehmannii plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
