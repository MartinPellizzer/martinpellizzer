                    <h1>Thlaspi alpestre var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Thlaspi alpestre var. glaucum, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
