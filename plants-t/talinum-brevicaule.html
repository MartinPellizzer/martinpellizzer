<p>Talinum brevicaule, commonly known as dwarf spiderflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a spiky central column resembling a spider's body. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Talinum brevicaule is also valued for its edible leaves, which are used in local cuisines for their mild, slightly tangy flavor.</p>
