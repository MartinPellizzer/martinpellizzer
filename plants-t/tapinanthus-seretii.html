                    <h1>Tapinanthus seretii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus seretii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host plants.</p>
<p>Tapinanthus seretii is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of ecological changes in its environment.</p>
