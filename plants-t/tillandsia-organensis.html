                    <h1>Tillandsia organensis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
