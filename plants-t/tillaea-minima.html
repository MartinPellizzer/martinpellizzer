<p>Tillaea minima, commonly known as the dwarf tillaea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered near the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a desirable addition to succulent collections.</p>
