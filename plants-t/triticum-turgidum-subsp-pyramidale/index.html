<p>Wild wheat, scientifically known as Triticum turgidum subsp. pyramidale, is a wild relative of modern wheat that thrives in temperate regions. This ancient grass species has been a vital part of human history, with evidence of its domestication dating back thousands of years. Its robust growth and high yield potential make it an important resource for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation. Despite its wild nature, it shares many genetic traits with cultivated wheat, offering valuable insights into crop improvement. As climate change and agricultural challenges grow, wild wheat stands as a key player in the quest for sustainable food systems.</p>
