                    <h1>Tillandsia procera</h1>
<p>Tillandsia procera, commonly known as the mountain air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
