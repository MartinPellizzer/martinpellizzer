                    <h1>Thismia thaithongiana</h1>
<p>Thismia thaithongiana, commonly known as the Thai ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thismiaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. It is typically found in shaded, humid forests, often growing in association with specific fungal networks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
