                <h1>Taxodium giganteum</h1>
<p>Taxodium giganteum, commonly known as the giant bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive buttressed roots and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it well adapted to wetland environments. The tree produces cones that release winged seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its leaves are scale-like and turn a striking red-brown in the fall before shedding.</p>
<p>The bark of the giant bald cypress is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and environmental stress.</p>
