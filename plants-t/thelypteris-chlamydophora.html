<p>Thelypteris chlamydophora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
