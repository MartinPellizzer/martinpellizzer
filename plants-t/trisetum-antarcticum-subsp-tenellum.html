<p>Trisetum antarcticum subsp.</p>
<p>tenellum, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, windy environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
