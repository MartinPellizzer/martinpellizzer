                    <h1>Trichoseris rueppellii</h1>
<p>Trichoseris rueppellii, commonly known as the African hairgrass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Trichoseris rueppellii is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
