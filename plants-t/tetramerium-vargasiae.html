<p>Tetramerium vargasiae, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
