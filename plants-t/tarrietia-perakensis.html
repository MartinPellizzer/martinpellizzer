                    <h1>Tarrietia perakensis</h1>
<p>Tarrietia perakensis, commonly known as the Perak river fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with high light exposure and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces small, spore-bearing capsules rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of interest to conservation biologists and botanists.</p>
