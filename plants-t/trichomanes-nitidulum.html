<p>Trichomanes nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Trichomanes nitidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
