                    <h1>Tillandsia heteromorpha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia heteromorpha, commonly known as the silver air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Tillandsia heteromorpha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
