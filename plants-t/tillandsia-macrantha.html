                    <h1>Tillandsia macrantha</h1>
<p>Tillandsia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
