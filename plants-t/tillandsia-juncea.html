<p>Tillandsia juncea, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a velvety appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia juncea is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
