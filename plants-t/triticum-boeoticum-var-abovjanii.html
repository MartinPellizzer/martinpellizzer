                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. abovjanii</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. abovjanii, commonly known as the Armenian wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat species and their potential for crop improvement.</p>
