                    <h1>Trichosporum arfakense</h1>
<p>Trichosporum arfakense, commonly known as the Arfak mountain moss, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has short, leafy shoots with a distinct, wiry structure, and its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous. Trichosporum arfakense plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its alpine habitat and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
