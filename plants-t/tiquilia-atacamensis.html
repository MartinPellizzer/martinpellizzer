                    <h1>Tiquilia atacamensis</h1>
<p>Tiquilia atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for the extreme conditions of the Atacama Desert.</p>
