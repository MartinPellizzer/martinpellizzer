<p>Thymus praecox subsp.</p>
<p>polytrichus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions.</p>
