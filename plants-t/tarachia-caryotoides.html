                    <h1>Tarachia caryotoides</h1>
<p>Tarachia caryotoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tarachia caryotoides is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
