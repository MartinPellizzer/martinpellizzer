<p>Tracheliopsis postii, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections.</p>
