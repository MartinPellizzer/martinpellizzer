<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its unique, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or sandy plains.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
