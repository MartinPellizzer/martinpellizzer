                    <h1>Taraxacum conturbatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum conturbatum, commonly known as the disturbed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that disperses its seeds via the wind, a common trait among members of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum conturbatum is a perennial plant that is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
