<p>Tectaria martinicensis f. microsora, commonly known as the small-leaf shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant features a distinctive, shield-shaped frond with a thick, leathery texture. Its leaves are smaller compared to the typical form of Tectaria martinicensis, and the fronds are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor environments.</p>
