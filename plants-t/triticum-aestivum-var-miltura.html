                    <h1>Triticum aestivum var. miltura</h1>
<p>Triticum aestivum var. miltura, commonly known as the millet wheat, is a variant of wheat that is less commonly cultivated than other wheat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller grains and shorter stature compared to common wheat. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources. The plant produces compact spikes with small, hard grains that are typically used for animal feed or traditional foods in certain cultures.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short growth cycle, which contribute to its resilience in challenging climates.</p>
