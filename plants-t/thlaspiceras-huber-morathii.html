                    <h1>Thlaspiceras huber-morathii</h1>
<p>Thlaspiceras huber-morathii, commonly known as the Huber-Morath's thlaspi, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lobed leaves adapted to cold, arid environments. Its reproductive structures are typically self-compatible, facilitating propagation in its limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and climate change, Thlaspiceras huber-morathii is considered endangered, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
