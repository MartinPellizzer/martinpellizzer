<p>Triticum compactum subsp.</p>
<p>iranoasiaticum, commonly known as the Iranian compact wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glabrous leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically shorter than those of other wheat species, with a distinctive arrangement of florets. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for enhancing drought tolerance in cultivated wheat varieties.</p>
