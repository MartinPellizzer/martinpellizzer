                    <h1>Triticum martius</h1>
<p>Triticum martius, commonly known as the Martian wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Triticum martius is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant resilience in extreme climates.</p>
