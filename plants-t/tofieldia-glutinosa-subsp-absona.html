<p>Tofieldia glutinosa subsp.</p>
<p>absona, commonly known as the sticky tofieldia, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are coated with a sticky resin, which helps to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
