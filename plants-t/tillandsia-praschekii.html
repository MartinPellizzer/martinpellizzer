<p>Tillandsia praschekii, commonly known as the Praschek's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a distinctive, elongated shape.</p>
<p>Tillandsia praschekii is adapted to humid, high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
