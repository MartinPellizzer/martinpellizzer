<p>Taraxacum officinale var. schroeterianum is a lesser-known variant of the common dandelion found in specific regions of central and southern europe. this plant shares many characteristics with its more widespread relatives but exhibits unique features that set it apart. it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often appearing after wildfires or in areas with human activity. its yellow flowers and distinctive seed heads make it easily recognizable, though it is often overlooked in favor of more common dandelion species. despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and pollinators.</p>
