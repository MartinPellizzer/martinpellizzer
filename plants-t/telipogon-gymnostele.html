                    <h1>Telipogon gymnostele</h1>
<p>Telipogon gymnostele, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique morphology, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern and a lack of true roots, relying instead on symbiotic fungi for nutrient absorption. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Telipogon gymnostele is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
