                    <h1>Tillandsia recurvata var. genuina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia recurvata var. genuina, commonly known as the silver veldt, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
