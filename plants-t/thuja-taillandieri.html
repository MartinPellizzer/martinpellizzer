                    <h1>Thuja taillandieri</h1>
<p>Thuja taillandieri, commonly known as the Thai fir or mountain thuja, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically found at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant in gardens.</p>
