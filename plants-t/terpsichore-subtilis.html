                <h1>Terpsichore subtilis</h1>
<p>Terpsichore subtilis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its poetic name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive system involves spore production, typical of ferns, with spores released from specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Terpsichore subtilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
