                    <h1>Tristagma uniflorum f. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Tristagma uniflorum f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare-flowered tristagma, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral display, with only a few flowers per inflorescence, distinguishing it from the typical form of Tristagma uniflorum. The plant produces small, hairy, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its genus.</p>
