<p>Thelypteris dentata var. violascens, commonly known as the violet fern, is a variant of the common spleenwort.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its subtle violet tinge in the fronds, which gives it its common name.</p>
