                    <h1>Triticum sativum subproles compactum</h1>
<p>Triticum sativum subproles compactum, commonly known as compact wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is known for its dense arrangement of spikelets, which can enhance its resistance to lodging. This subspecies is often used in breeding programs to improve yield stability under adverse conditions. Its genetic makeup contributes to traits such as improved grain quality and better adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>The plant typically has a robust root system and a high photosynthetic efficiency, making it suitable for various agricultural environments.</p>
