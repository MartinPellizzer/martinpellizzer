<p>Teline maderensis subsp.</p>
<p>paivae, commonly known as the Maderan alpine bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Portugal. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and violet.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
