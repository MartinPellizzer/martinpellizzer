<p>Ternatea brachystegia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
