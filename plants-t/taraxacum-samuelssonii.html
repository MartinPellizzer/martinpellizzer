<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. Its yellow flower head consists of numerous ray florets that open in the daytime and close at night.</p>
<p>Samuelsson's dandelion is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
