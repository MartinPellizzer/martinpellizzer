                    <h1>Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta</h1>
<p>Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a variant of the Pacific yew tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a conical shape and reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the stems.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its role in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, derived from its bark and needles.</p>
