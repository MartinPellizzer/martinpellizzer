<p>Themistoclesia inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes slender, branching stems and specialized organs for trapping prey.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous tendencies, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
