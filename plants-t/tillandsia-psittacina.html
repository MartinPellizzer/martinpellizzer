                    <h1>Tillandsia psittacina</h1>
<p>Tillandsia psittacina, commonly known as the parrot tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces vibrant, orchid-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
