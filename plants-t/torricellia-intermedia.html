<p>Torricellia intermedia, commonly known as the common water bean, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually submerged. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Torricellia intermedia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
