                    <h1>Triticum distertum</h1>
<p>Triticum distertum, commonly known as the slender wheat or wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish florets. Triticum distertum is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>It is considered a minor wild relative of cultivated wheat, with potential interest in genetic research for improving wheat varieties.</p>
