                    <h1>Tapinanthus tricolor</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a unique life cycle, with a seedling stage that attaches to a host and then develops into a mature plant. It is native to Africa and thrives in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation.</p>
