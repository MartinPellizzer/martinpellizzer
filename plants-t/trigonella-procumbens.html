The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant in dryland agriculture.</p>
