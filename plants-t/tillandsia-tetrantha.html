<p>Tillandsia tetrantha, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Tillandsia tetrantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
