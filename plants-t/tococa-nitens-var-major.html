                    <h1>Tococa nitens var. major</h1>
<p>Tococa nitens var. major, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces oval, woody pods that contain bitter, caffeinated seeds used in traditional beverages. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural stimulants and its ecological importance in the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, it is less cultivated than other cocoa species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
