                    <h1>Taraxacum exstinctum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum exstinctum, commonly known as the extinct dandelion, is a rare and historically significant plant species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, ribbed stem that supports a single, towering flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to specific regions in Europe and was once found in moist meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered extinct in the wild, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
