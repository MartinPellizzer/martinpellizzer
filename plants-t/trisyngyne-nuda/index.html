                            <h1>Trisyngyne Nuda</h1>
<p>Common st. john's wort, scientifically known as Trisyngyne nuda, is a small flowering plant native to parts of eastern and central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers and its preference for moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest floor. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations. Its unique ecological niche makes it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
