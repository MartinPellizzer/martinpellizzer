                    <h1>Tapinanthus mechowii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus mechowii, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. This species is often found parasitizing various plants in the family Fabaceae. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed in agricultural settings.</p>
