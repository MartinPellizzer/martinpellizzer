<p>Thelypteris pentapinnata, commonly known as the five-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across wetland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris pentapinnata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
