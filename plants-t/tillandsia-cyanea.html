                    <h1>Tillandsia cyanea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia cyanea, commonly known as the violet air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia cyanea produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
