                    <h1>Triticum rigidum</h1>
<p>Triticum rigidum, commonly known as rigid wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing a single grain. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Despite its wild appearance, it has been used in traditional agriculture and is a source of genetic material for modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
