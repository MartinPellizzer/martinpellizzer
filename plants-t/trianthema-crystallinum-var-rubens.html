                    <h1>Trianthema crystallinum var. rubens</h1>
<p>Trianthema crystallinum var. rubens, commonly known as the red crystalline sandwort, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright red flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its crystalline structures on the leaves, which are composed of calcium oxalate crystals.</p>
