<p>Tragacantha bienertii, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically small and grayish-green to reduce water loss. It is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha bienertii is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
