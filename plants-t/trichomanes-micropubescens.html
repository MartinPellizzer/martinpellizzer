<p>Trichomanes micropubescens, commonly known as the small-hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a thin layer of fine hairs, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Trichomanes micropubescens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities.</p>
