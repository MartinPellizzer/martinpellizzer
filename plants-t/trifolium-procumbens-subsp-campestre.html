<p>Trifolium procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>campestre, commonly known as creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
