                            <h1>Terminalia Selloana</h1>
<p>Blackwood, scientifically known as Terminalia selloana, is a remarkable tree native to southern Africa. It is prized for its dense, hard wood that has been used for centuries in construction and craftsmanship. This evergreen tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in coastal and riverine forests. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a key species in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
