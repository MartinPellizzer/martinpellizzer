                    <h1>Tapinanthus marginatus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus marginatus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that exhibits a unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that can spread over its host. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found on plants such as Acacia and Euphorbia.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its complex relationship with host plants and its role in ecological interactions.</p>
