                    <h1>Trianea bogotensis</h1>
<p>Trianea bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot√° fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trianea bogotensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
