                    <h1>Tillandsia circinnatioides</h1>
<p>Tillandsia circinnatioides, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia circinnatioides is well adapted to coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy choice for gardens in such regions.</p>
