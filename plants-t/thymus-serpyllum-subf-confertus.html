<p>Thymus serpyllum subf.</p>
<p>confertus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its compact growth and unique floral structure.</p>
