<p>Taraxacum arctogenum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold climates. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with feathery pappus. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
