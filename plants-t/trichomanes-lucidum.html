<p>Trichomanes lucidum, commonly known as the shining maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ancient fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, giving it a shiny appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
