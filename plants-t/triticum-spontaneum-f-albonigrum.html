                    <h1>Triticum spontaneum f. albonigrum</h1>
<p>Triticum spontaneum f. albonigrum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat with a white-black form, is a wild grass species native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to environmental stress.</p>
