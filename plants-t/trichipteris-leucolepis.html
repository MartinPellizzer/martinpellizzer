<p>Trichipteris leucolepis, commonly known as the silver feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in attracting moisture and small insects.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
