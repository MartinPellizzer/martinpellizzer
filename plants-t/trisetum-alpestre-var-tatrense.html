                    <h1>Trisetum alpestre var. tatrense</h1>
<p>Trisetum alpestre var. tatrense, commonly known as the Alpine trisetum, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemma-like structures.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
