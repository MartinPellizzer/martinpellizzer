                    <h1>Triticum × erebuni</h1>
<p>Triticum × erebuni, commonly known as the wild wheat or Erebuni wheat, is a naturally occurring hybrid species resulting from the cross between Triticum urartu and Triticum monococcum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glumeless spikelets and is typically found in the highlands of the Caucasus region. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard grains that are often used in traditional breeding programs. Triticum × erebuni is considered an important genetic resource for wheat improvement due to its potential for enhancing disease resistance and adaptability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying the evolution and domestication of cereal crops.</p>
