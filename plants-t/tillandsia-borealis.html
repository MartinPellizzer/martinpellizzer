                    <h1>Tillandsia borealis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia borealis, commonly known as the northern air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia borealis typically blooms with small, pale blue or white flowers, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to environments with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
