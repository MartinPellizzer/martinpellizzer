                    <h1>Tillandsia roseoscapa</h1>
<p>Tillandsia roseoscapa, commonly known as the rose-scape air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The flower spikes, which can be pink or red, are a striking feature that adds to its ornamental value.</p>
