                    <h1>Taeniophyllum triangulipetalum</h1>
<p>Taeniophyllum triangulipetalum, commonly known as the triangle-petaled liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with triangularly shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
