                            <h1>Taraxacum Dens-Leonis Subsp. Palustre</h1>
<p>Water dandelion, scientifically known as Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp. palustre, is a unique member of the dandelion family that thrives in wetland environments. This plant is distinguished by its ability to flourish in waterlogged soils, making it an important indicator of moist habitats. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in soggy conditions. While it shares similarities with common dandelions, it is more closely related to other aquatic or semi-aquatic species. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, the water dandelion is a subject of growing interest in botanical research.</p>
