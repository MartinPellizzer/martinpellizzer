                    <h1>Tylostemon ndongensis</h1>
<p>Tylostemon ndongensis, commonly known as the Namibian starling tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub or tree that exhibits unique adaptations to the harsh desert environment, including thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract specific pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in an arid landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat degradation, Tylostemon ndongensis is considered endangered.</p>
