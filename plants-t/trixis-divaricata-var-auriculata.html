                    <h1>Trixis divaricata var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Trixis divaricata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered with small, dense leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are distinctive for their auriculate (ear-shaped) base, which gives the species its common name.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
