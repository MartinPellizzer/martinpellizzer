                    <h1>Triticum monococcum var. zuccarinii</h1>
<p>Triticum monococcum var. zuccarinii, commonly known as the Sicilian wheat or Sicilian emmer, is a wild relative of modern wheat with unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in Mediterranean climates, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing heads with pale yellow to brown florets, and its seeds are encased in tough, glumes. It has a high genetic diversity, making it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience.</p>
<p>Due to its wild nature, it is often found in undisturbed soil areas and is considered a potential source of genetic material for crop improvement.</p>
