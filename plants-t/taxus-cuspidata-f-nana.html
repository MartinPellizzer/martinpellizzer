                    <h1>Taxus cuspidata f. nana</h1>
<p>Taxus cuspidata f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Taxus cuspidata. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, visually striking plant.</p>
