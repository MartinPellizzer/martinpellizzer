                    <h1>Tillandsia paniculata var. fendleri</h1>
<p>Tillandsia paniculata var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on cacti or other plants without soil. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking clusters of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation with proper air circulation and occasional misting.</p>
