<p>Triodia stricta, commonly known as the rigid spinifex, is a perennial grass found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Triodia stricta plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert fauna.</p>
