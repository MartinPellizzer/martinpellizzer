                    <h1>Todea pellucida</h1>
<p>Todea pellucida, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Todea pellucida is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in controlled water conditions.</p>
