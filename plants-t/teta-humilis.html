                    <h1>Teta humilis</h1>
<p>Teta humilis, commonly known as the dwarf teta, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Teta humilis is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
