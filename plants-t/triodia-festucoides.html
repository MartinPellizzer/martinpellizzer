<p>Triodia festucoides, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that forms dense, low-growing clumps with wiry, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
