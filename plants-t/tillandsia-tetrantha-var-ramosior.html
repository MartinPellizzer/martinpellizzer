                    <h1>Tillandsia tetrantha var. ramosior</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tetrantha var. ramosior, commonly known as the silver pine or silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees in humid forests. Its leaves are covered in fine trichomes that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
