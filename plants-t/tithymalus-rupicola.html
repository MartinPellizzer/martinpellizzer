<p>Tithymalus rupicola, commonly known as the rock tithymale, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone and sandstone cliffs. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tithymalus rupicola is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
