<p>Triticum asiaticum, commonly known as Asian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is a grass with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, each containing a single grain. It is primarily found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Triticum asiaticum is often considered a weed but has historical significance in the domestication of wheat.</p>
