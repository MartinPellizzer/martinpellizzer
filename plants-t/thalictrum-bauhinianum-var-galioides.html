<p>Thalictrum bauhinianum var. galioides, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
