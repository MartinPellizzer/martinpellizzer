<p>Thelypteris thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as China, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant.</p>
<p>Thelypteris thibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
