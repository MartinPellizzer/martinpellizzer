                    <h1>Tetramicra sarcophylla</h1>
<p>Tetramicra sarcophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, leaf-like structures that serve as photosynthetic organs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
