<p>Triphylleion chirripoi, commonly known as the Guanacaste orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and colorful, with a distinct three-lobed lip that plays a role in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Triphylleion chirripoi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
