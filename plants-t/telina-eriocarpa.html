<p>Telina eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit-bearing plant, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Telina eriocarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
