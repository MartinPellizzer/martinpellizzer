                    <h1>Toxicodendron hirtellum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron hirtellum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the smoothleaf poison oak, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that contain toxic compounds. It is known for causing skin irritation upon contact due to the presence of urushiol, a potent allergen.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other poison oak species but can be distinguished by its smoother leaf surface and smaller fruits.</p>
