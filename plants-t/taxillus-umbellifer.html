                    <h1>Taxillus umbellifer</h1>
<p>Taxillus umbellifer, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Taxillus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Taxillus umbellifer is found in various regions, including parts of Asia and the Americas, where it plays a role in ecological interactions with its host species.</p>
