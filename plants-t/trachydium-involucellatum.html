                    <h1>Trachydium involucellatum</h1>
<p>Trachydium involucellatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It reproduces through seeds and can also propagate via vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
