                    <h1>Taraxacum multesimum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum multesimum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a parachute-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Taraxacum multesimum is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
