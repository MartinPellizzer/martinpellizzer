                    <h1>Taraxacum lacerilobatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum lacerilobatum, commonly known as the lacerate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is native to regions of North America and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
