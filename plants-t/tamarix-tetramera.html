                    <h1>Tamarix tetramera</h1>
<p>Tamarix tetramera, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has feathery, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight and minimize heat stress.</p>
<p>Tamarix tetramera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
