                    <h1>Tillandsia pyramidata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pyramidata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous air plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through soil. This variety is notable for its ability to produce offsets, or "pups," that can develop into independent plants while still attached to the mother plant. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that help it retain water.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical regions.</p>
