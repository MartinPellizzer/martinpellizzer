                    <h1>Tenicroa exuviata</h1>
<p>Tenicroa exuviata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dark green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Tenicroa exuviata is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
