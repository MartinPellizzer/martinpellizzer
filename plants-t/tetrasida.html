<p>Tetrasida, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and purple or violet flowers. The plant is often associated with good luck, especially when a four-leaf clover is found, as it is rare. Tetrasida grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular subject in both folklore and horticulture.</p>
