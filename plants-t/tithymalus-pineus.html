                    <h1>Tithymalus pineus</h1>
<p>Tithymalus pineus, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, cushion-like growth on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines. The thallus is typically greenish-yellow, with a smooth, leathery texture and a distinct, slightly lobed appearance. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
