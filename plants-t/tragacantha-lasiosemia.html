                    <h1>Tragacantha lasiosemia</h1>
<p>Tragacantha lasiosemia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish coating that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Tragacantha lasiosemia is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid climates with minimal rainfall.</p>
