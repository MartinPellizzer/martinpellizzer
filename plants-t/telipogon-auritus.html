                    <h1>Telipogon auritus</h1>
<p>Telipogon auritus, commonly known as the golden tassel orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence that bears numerous yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive auricle-like appendage on the lip. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon auritus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
