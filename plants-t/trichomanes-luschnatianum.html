                    <h1>Trichomanes luschnatianum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes luschnatianum, commonly known as the Luschnat's maidenhair, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
