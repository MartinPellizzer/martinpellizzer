                    <h1>Taraxacum fictum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum fictum, commonly known as the fictional dandelion, is a hypothetical plant species often used in botanical discussions for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, similar to the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). While not a real species, it is sometimes referenced in scientific literature to explore hypothetical adaptations or ecological roles. The plant is believed to have similar growth habits and flowering patterns as its real-world counterparts.</p>
<p>Its study helps botanists understand potential evolutionary pathways in plant species.</p>
