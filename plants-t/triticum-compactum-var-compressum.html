                    <h1>Triticum compactum var. compressum</h1>
<p>Triticum compactum var. compressum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to standard wheat species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically produces small, dense spikes with numerous florets, which contribute to its high yield potential. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system that enhances its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in breeding programs to improve agronomic traits in modern wheat cultivars.</p>
