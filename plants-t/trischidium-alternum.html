                    <h1>Trischidium alternum</h1>
<p>Trischidium alternum, commonly known as the variable trichoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often exhibit a striking variegation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are a source of nectar for local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trischidium alternum is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
