<p>Thelypteris praetermissa, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
