                    <h1>Trillium camschatcense var. kurilense</h1>
<p>Trillium camschatcense var. kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril white trillium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, showy flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
