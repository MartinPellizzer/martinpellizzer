                    <h1>Tetragonia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Tetragonia verrucosa, commonly known as the prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces edible, tangy-tasting fruits that are sometimes used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Tetragonia verrucosa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
