                    <h1>Triticum boeoticum var. albonigrum</h1>
<p>Triticum boeoticum var. albonigrum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its historical significance in early wheat domestication.</p>
