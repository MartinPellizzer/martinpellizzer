                    <h1>Trapa europaea</h1>
<p>Trapa europaea, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves with a waxy surface and distinctive, boat-shaped seed pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of water bodies.</p>
<p>Trapa europaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
