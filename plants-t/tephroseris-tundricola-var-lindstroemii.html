                    <h1>Tephroseris tundricola var. lindstroemii</h1>
<p>Tephroseris tundricola var. lindstroemii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate the plant against the harsh cold. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the short growing season of polar regions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering pattern compared to the typical form of Tephroseris tundricola.</p>
