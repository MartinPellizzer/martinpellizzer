                    <h1>Taraxacum latebracteatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum latebracteatum, commonly known as the latebracteate dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
