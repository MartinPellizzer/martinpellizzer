                    <h1>Triticum heldreichii f. biaristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum heldreichii f. biaristatum, commonly known as the Balkan wheatgrass, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its genetic makeup is unique, reflecting a hybrid origin between Triticum aestivum and Triticum monococcum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
