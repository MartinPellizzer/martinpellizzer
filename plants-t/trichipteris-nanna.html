<p>Trichipteris nanna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Trichipteris nanna plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
