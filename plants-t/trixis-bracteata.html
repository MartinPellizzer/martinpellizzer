<p>Trixis bracteata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that produces yellow flowers and has a taproot system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant's leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Trixis bracteata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in semi-arid environments.</p>
