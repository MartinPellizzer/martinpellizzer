                    <h1>Taxus celebica</h1>
<p>Taxus celebica, commonly known as the Celebes yew, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with distinctive dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Taxus celebica is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is one of the most threatened yew species in the world.</p>
