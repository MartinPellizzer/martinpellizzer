<p>Triticum aestivum subsp.</p>
<p>sphaerococcum, commonly known as the spherical spikelet wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. This subspecies features compact, spherical spikelets that differ from the typical elongated spikelets of common wheat.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a shorter stature and a more condensed arrangement of florets, which may influence its growth habits and ecological niche. Its botanical traits make it of interest in studies related to wheat diversity and adaptation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less commonly cultivated but holds significance in genetic research and plant taxonomy.</p>
