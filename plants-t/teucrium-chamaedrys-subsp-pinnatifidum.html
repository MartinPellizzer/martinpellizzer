<p>Teucrium chamaedrys subsp.</p>
<p>pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into sharp, pointed lobes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
