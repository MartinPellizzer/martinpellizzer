                    <h1>Tragiola</h1>
<p>Tragiola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Tragiola is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become an invasive species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
