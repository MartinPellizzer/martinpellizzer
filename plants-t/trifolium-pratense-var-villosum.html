<p>Trifolium pratense var. villosum, commonly known as hairy red clover, is a variant of the red clover species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are trifoliate, meaning each leaf consists of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
