                    <h1>Terebinthus atlanticus</h1>
<p>Terebinthus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic terebinth, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
