<p>Tephrocactus pentlandii var. rossianus, commonly known as the Rossian hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
