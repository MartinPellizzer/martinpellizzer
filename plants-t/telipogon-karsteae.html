                    <h1>Telipogon karsteae</h1>
<p>Telipogon karsteae, commonly known as the karst lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in karst environments characterized by limestone rock formations.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to grow on rock surfaces, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Telipogon karsteae is often found in secluded, humid microclimates within karst landscapes.</p>
