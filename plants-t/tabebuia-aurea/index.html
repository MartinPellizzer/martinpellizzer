<p>Golden trumpet tree, scientifically known as Tabebuia aurea, is a striking tropical species native to Central and South America. It is renowned for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dazzling display during the rainy season. The tree's unique appearance and rapid growth make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its bark and wood are also valued for their durability and aesthetic appeal. Despite its beauty, the Golden trumpet tree requires specific care to thrive in non-native environments.</p>
