                    <h1>Tritonia crocata var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Tritonia crocata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces striking purple or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, typically growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a rare and challenging species to cultivate.</p>
