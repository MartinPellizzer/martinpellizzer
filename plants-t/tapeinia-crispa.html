<p>Tapeinia crispa, commonly known as the hairy shield lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, crust-like thallus with a dense, hairy texture.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and boreal forest regions. The lichen has a pale to dark grayish-green color, with a powdery or crusty surface that can vary in appearance depending on environmental conditions. It is characterized by its intricate network of rhizines that anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Tapeinia crispa is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and forest health.</p>
