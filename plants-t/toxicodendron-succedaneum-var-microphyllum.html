                    <h1>Toxicodendron succedaneum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron succedaneum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>This variant is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle differences in leaf size and stem texture.</p>
