<p>Tecoma fluviatilis, commonly known as the river trumpet, is a striking flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow blooms and long, trumpet-shaped petals that attract a variety of pollinators. This plant thrives in moist environments, often found near rivers and wetlands, where it plays an important ecological role. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects. Despite its beauty, Tecoma fluviatilis remains relatively unknown to many gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
