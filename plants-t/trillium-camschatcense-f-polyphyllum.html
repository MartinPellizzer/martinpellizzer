<p>Trillium camschatcense f. polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved white trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the trillium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy white petals and multiple broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
