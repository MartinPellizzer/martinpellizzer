                    <h1>Tapinanthus quinquangulus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus quinquangulus, commonly known as the five-angled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its thread-like, yellow-orange stems that缠绕 (twine) around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. Tapinanthus quinquangulus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of crops.</p>
