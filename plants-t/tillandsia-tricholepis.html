                    <h1>Tillandsia tricholepis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its inflorescence produces striking purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Tillandsia tricholepis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance.</p>
