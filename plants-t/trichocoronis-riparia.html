<p>Trichocoronis riparia, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Trichocoronis riparia plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
