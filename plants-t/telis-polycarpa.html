                    <h1>Telis polycarpa</h1>
<p>Telis polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited telis, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into numerous small, dry fruits, contributing to its common name. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telis polycarpa is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
