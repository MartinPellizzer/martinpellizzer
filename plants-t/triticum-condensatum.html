                    <h1>Triticum condensatum</h1>
<p>Triticum condensatum, commonly known as the condensed wheat, is a rare and extinct species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers that give way to hard, glume-enclosed grains. Due to its rarity and historical significance in early agricultural studies, it is of interest to botanists and historians.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Triticum condensatum is no longer found in the wild, making it a subject of conservation and genetic research efforts.</p>
