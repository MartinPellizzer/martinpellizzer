                    <h1>Tillandsia nana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia nana, commonly known as the dwarf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
