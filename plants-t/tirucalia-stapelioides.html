<p>Tirucalia stapelioides, commonly known as the rock fig or stone apple, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small apples.

<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
