                    <h1>Taraxacum ammophilum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum ammophilum, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of bracts after flowering. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, windy conditions. It is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with flowering typically occurring in spring and early summer.</p>
