                    <h1>Tillandsia utriculata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia utriculata, commonly known as the air plant or Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other surfaces, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its dense, hanging clusters of gray-green foliage create a unique, moss-like appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead uses its specialized leaves to capture water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
