                    <h1>Terminalia pachystyla</h1>
<p>Terminalia pachystyla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
