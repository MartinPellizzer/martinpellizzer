                    <h1>Triodon albus var. macer</h1>
<p>Triodon albus var. macer, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its pale, often whitish thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on calcareous substrates such as limestone or concrete, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually crustose, forming a thin, adherent layer on the surface. It lacks distinct lobes and has a granular texture, which aids in its identification.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, making it a common indicator of specific ecological conditions.</p>
