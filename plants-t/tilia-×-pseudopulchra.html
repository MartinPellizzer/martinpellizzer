                    <h1>Tilia × pseudopulchra</h1>
<p>Tilia × pseudopulchra, commonly known as the hybrid linden or European linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea, resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and tolerance to urban conditions.</p>
