<p>Taraxacum rhaeticum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in rocky and meadow habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
