                    <h1>Taraxacum pseudostenoschistum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum pseudostenoschistum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit that releases seeds with white, feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
