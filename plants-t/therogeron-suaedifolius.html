                    <h1>Therogeron suaedifolius</h1>
<p>Therogeron suaedifolius, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, sandpaper-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Therogeron suaedifolius plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
