<p>Theobroma ovatifolium, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing cocoa beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Theobroma ovatifolium is closely related to the Theobroma cacao tree, which is used to produce chocolate.</p>
