                    <h1>Tassilicyparis</h1>
<p>Tassilicyparis, commonly known as the Tassili cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Tassili n'Ajjer mountain range in Algeria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and dense, feathery foliage that forms a distinctive crown. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of resilience in arid environments. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Tassilicyparis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
