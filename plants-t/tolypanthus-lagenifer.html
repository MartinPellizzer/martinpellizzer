                    <h1>Tolypanthus lagenifer</h1>
<p>Tolypanthus lagenifer, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique plant characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically palmate, with lobes that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress.</p>
