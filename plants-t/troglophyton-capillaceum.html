<p>Troglophyton capillaceum, commonly known as the cave beardgrass, is a unique flowering plant native to subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant thrives in dark, humid conditions with limited light, adapting to the challenging cave ecosystem. Its reproductive structures are specialized for pollination by minute insects or bats.</p>
