<p>Thesium costatum var. juniperinum, commonly known as the juniper-like thesium, is a flowering plant species native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments.
