<p>Tephroseris schistosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
