<p>Trichipteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical landscapes.</p>
