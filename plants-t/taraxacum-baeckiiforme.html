                    <h1>Taraxacum baeckiiforme</h1>
<p>Taraxacum baeckiiforme, commonly known as the Baeckius's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a hollow, umbrella-like structure called a pappus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common and resilient weed in many regions.</p>
