                    <h1>Tetrorchidium rotundatum</h1>
<p>Tetrorchidium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its natural habitat.</p>
