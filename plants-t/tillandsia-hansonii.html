                    <h1>Tillandsia hansonii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia hansonii, commonly known as the Hanson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically white or pink, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habits and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections.</p>
