                            <h1>Taxillus Incanus</h1>
<p>Taxillus incanus is a parasitic plant commonly known as the Indian mistletoe. It thrives by attaching itself to the branches of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host. This species is native to regions of Asia, including India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its small, green leaves and white, clustered flowers make it visually distinct. Despite its parasitic nature, Taxillus incanus plays a unique role in its ecosystem.</p>
