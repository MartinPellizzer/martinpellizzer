<p>Trichilia schomburgkii subsp.</p>
<p>javariensis, commonly known as the Java trichilia, is a member of the Meliaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests.</p>
<p>The plant produces woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to the main species.</p>
