<p>Triticum heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. The plant exhibits a range of morphological variations, including different spikelet structures and glume characteristics. It is often found in rocky and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to researchers studying the evolution and domestication of wheat species.</p>
