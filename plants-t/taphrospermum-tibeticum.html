                    <h1>Taphrospermum tibeticum</h1>
<p>Taphrospermum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Taphrospermum tibeticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme temperatures and low moisture makes it an important species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
