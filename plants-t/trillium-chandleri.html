<p>Trillium chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's trillium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its three large, waxy, white petals and three sepals that are typically a lighter greenish-white color. The plant produces a single, showy flower with prominent yellow stamens and a greenish pistil, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is often found in association with other rare flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
