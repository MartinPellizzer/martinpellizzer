                    <h1>Triptilion spinosum var. remyanum</h1>
<p>Triptilion spinosum var. remyanum, commonly known as the spiny triptilion, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its unique spiny structures on the stems and leaves are adaptations to deter herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
