                    <h1>Taraxacum multilaciniatum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum multilaciniatum, commonly known as the multilobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This species is often mistaken for other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its finely lobed leaves and unique floral structure.</p>
