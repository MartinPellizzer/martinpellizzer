<p>Tectaria moranii, commonly known as the Morani's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Tectaria moranii plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
