                            <h1>Triticum Cristatum</h1>
<p>Triticum cristatum is a unique wild wheat species known for its distinctive rachilla hairs that give it a tufted appearance. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, this plant has been studied for its potential in agricultural and genetic research. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions. Despite its historical presence, it remains relatively uncommon in modern agricultural settings. Its genetic makeup offers insights into the evolution of wheat and may hold value for future crop improvement.</p>
