                    <h1>Tephrocactus halophilus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus halophilus, commonly known as the salt-cactus, is a species native to arid and coastal regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus halophilus is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
