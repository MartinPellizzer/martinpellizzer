<p>Tillandsia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Tillandsia saxatilis is known for its ability to survive in harsh, rocky habitats where few other plants can grow.</p>
