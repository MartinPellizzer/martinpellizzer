<p>Tillaea macrantha var. sepalosa, commonly known as the Sierra lichenrose, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its sepals that are often fused at the base, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
