<p>Tetrapora gunniana, commonly known as the Gunn's tetrapora, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soil conditions. Tetrapora gunniana is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and it plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
