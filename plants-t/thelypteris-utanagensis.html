<p>Thelypteris utanagensis, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides.</p>
