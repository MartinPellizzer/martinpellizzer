<p>Trifolium repens subsp.</p>
<p>prostratum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale-colored marking.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly notable for its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread efficiently across the ground.</p>
