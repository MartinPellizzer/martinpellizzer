<p>Taxus brevifolia subsp.</p>
<p>polychaeta, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces distinctive red, berry-like cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is notable for its taxane-rich bark and foliage, which have historically been used in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
