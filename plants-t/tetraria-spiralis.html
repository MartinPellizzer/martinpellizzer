                    <h1>Tetraria spiralis</h1>
<p>Tetraria spiralis, commonly known as the spiral tetraria, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-like arrangement of its leaf-like structures, which are typically small and closely appressed to the substrate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are spherical and contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Tetraria spiralis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
