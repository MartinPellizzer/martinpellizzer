<p>Tylanthus thunbergianus, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact.</p>
