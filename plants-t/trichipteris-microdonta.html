<p>Trichipteris microdonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Trichipteris microdonta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
