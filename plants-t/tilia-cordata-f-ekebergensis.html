                    <h1>Tilia cordata f. ekebergensis</h1>
<p>Tilia cordata f. ekebergensis, commonly known as the Ekeberg's small-leaf lime, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the small-leaf lime tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, heart-shaped leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Tilia cordata. This form is native to southern Norway and is considered a natural variant rather than a cultivated hybrid. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens with specific ecological conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in botanical collections.</p>
