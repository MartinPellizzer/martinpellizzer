                    <h1>Tillandsia lymanii</h1>
<p>Tillandsia lymanii, commonly known as the Lyman's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange to red flower spikes that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Tillandsia lymanii is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
