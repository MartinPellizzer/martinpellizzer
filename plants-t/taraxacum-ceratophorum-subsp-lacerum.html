<p>Taraxacum ceratophorum subsp.</p>
<p>lacerum, commonly known as the jagged dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are distinctly lobed and have a jagged appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that eventually develops into a spherical seed ball with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other dandelion species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth habit.</p>
