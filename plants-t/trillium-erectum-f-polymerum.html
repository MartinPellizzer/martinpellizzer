                    <h1>Trillium erectum f. polymerum</h1>
<p>Trillium erectum f. polymerum, commonly known as the purple trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the common trillium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant has three broadly ovate leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the base. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
