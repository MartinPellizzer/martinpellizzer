                    <h1>Tillandsia bracteata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia bracteata, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Tillandsia bracteata produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
