<p>Trifolium sefinense, commonly known as the Sefin's clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium sefinense is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
