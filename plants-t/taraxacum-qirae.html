                    <h1>Taraxacum qirae</h1>
<p>Taraxacum qirae, commonly known as the Qira dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of China, particularly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features a rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taraxacum qirae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
