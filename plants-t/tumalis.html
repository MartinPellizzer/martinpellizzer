<p>Tumalis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, ovate leaves that are usually bright green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species for coastal ecosystem stability.</p>
