<p>Triticum speltoides subsp.</p>
<p>aucheri, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. Its seeds are small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
