                    <h1>Templetonia rossii</h1>
<p>Templetonia rossii, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, through specialized structures called haustelia. Its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries are adaptations for attracting pollinators and dispersing seeds.</p>
<p>Templetonia rossii plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
