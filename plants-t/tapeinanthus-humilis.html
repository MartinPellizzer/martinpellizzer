<p>Tapeinanthus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils.</p>
