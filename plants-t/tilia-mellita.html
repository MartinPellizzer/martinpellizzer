<p>Tilia mellita, commonly known as small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical蒴果 that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Tilia mellita is often found in moist, fertile soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in landscaping.</p>
