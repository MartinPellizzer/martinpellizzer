<p>Taraxacum albescens, commonly known as the white-chrome dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flower head, which consists of numerous small, rayless florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
