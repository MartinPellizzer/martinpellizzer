                    <h1>Trichomanes acranthum</h1>
<p>Trichomanes acranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is sometimes cultivated in controlled greenhouse settings.</p>
