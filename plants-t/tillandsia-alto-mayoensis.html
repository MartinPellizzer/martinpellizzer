<p>Tillandsia alto-mayoensis, commonly known as the Alto Mayo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
