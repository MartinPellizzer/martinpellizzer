<p>Trisetum cernuum, commonly known as the nodding hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, arching stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to blue-green grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of compact, drooping clusters of spikelets, which give it its characteristic nodding appearance.</p>
<p>Trisetum cernuum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
