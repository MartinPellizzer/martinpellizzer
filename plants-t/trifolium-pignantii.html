                    <h1>Trifolium pignantii</h1>
<p>Trifolium pignantii, commonly known as the Pignant's clover, is a rare and specialized species of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species.</p>
