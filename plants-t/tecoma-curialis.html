<p>Tecoma curialis, commonly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats.</p>
