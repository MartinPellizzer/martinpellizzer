                    <h1>Thymus striatus</h1>
<p>Thymus striatus, commonly known as the striated thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has narrow, gray-green leaves with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Thymus striatus is also valued as a culinary herb, though its strong flavor makes it less common in modern cooking.</p>
