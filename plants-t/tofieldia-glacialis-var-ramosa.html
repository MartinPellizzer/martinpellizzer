<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
