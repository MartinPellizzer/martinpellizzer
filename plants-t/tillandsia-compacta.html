                    <h1>Tillandsia compacta</h1>
<p>Tillandsia compacta, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, pale flowers that are usually clustered at the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia compacta is well adapted to dry and humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
