<p>Thelypteris oppositiformis, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a pinnate or bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Thelypteris oppositiformis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
