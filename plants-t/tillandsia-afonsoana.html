                    <h1>Tillandsia afonsoana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia afonsoana, commonly known as the Afonso's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
