                    <h1>Tillandsia orogenes</h1>
<p>Tillandsia orogenes, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding visual interest to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Tillandsia orogenes is well-suited to thrive in humid, mountainous environments.</p>
