                    <h1>Thelypteris membranacea</h1>
<p>Thelypteris membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a fine, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
