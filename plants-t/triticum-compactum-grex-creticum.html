<p>Triticum compactum grex creticum, commonly known as Cretan wheat, is a botanical variety native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete.</p>
<p>It is a small-grained wheat species characterized by its compact growth habit and early maturing traits. The plant typically exhibits a short stature with dense spikes and awned florets, which are typical features of many wild wheat species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its historical significance and potential for modern agricultural use, it remains of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers.</p>
