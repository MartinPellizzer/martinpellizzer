                    <h1>Tillandsia subtropicalis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia subtropicalis, commonly known as the subtropical air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
