                    <h1>Tubella tropida</h1>
<p>Tubella tropida, commonly known as the tropical tubeworm, is a species of polychaete annelid found in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a distinctive tubular structure that houses its internal organs. The plant-like appearance of Tubella tropida has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a marine invertebrate. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its habitat is typically shallow coastal waters where it thrives in sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
