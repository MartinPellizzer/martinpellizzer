                    <h1>Tillaea colorata</h1>
<p>Tillaea colorata, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils makes it a hardy species adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Tillaea colorata is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
