                    <h1>Tillandsia rosea</h1>
<p>Tillandsia rosea, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a type of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from a central stem.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
