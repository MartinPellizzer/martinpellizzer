                    <h1>Thenardia corymbosa</h1>
<p>Thenardia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
