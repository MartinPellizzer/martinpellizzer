<p>Thelypteris multiseta, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
