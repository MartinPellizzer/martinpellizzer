<p>Touchardia haupuensis, commonly known as the Hāpū tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawaiʻi.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats within mesic to wet forest ecosystems, often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
