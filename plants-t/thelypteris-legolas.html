<p>Thelypteris legolas, commonly known as the Elven Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the undercanopy of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Thelypteris legolas is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
