<p>Trichelostylis ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's spike fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its intricate, branching fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
