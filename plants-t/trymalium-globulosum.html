                    <h1>Trymalium globulosum</h1>
<p>Trymalium globulosum, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
