                    <h1>Terebinthina tillaeoides</h1>
<p>Terebinthina tillaeoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Terebinthina tillaeoides is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
