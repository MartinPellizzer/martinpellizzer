                    <h1>Tamarix nilotica var. eilathensis</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Tamarix nilotica var. eilotensis, commonly known as the Eilat tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and desert environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it ecologically and economically significant in arid landscapes.</p>
