<p>Tephrocactus microclados, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Tephrocactus microclados is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant.</p>
