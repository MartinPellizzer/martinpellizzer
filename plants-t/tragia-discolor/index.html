                            <h1>Tragia Discolor</h1>
<p>Common tragia, scientifically known as Tragia discolor, is a hardy annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Despite its unassuming appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh conditions. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common sight in many parts of its native range.</p>
