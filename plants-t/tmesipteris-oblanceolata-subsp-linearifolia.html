<p>Tmesipteris oblanceolata subsp.</p>
<p>linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy or aquatic soils.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist habitats.</p>
