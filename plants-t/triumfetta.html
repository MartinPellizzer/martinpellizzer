<p>Triumfetta, commonly known as the "sicklepod" or "goatweed," is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, characterized by their alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, often dispersed by wind. Triumfetta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>They are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas.</p>
