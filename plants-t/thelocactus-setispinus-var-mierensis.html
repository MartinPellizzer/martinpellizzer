                    <h1>Thelocactus setispinus var. mierensis</h1>
<p>Thelocactus setispinus var. mierensis, commonly known as the Mierensis thorn cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to a small region in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
