                    <h1>Tapinanthus bulawayensis</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus bulawayensis, commonly known as the Bulawayo dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its native environment.</p>
