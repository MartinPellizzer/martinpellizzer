<p>Talisia carinata f. acutisepala, commonly known as the acute-sepal talisia, is a botanical variant within the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive acute (sharp-pointed) sepals, which set it apart from other forms of Talisia carinata. The plant typically features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, pale yellow flowers with five petals. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
