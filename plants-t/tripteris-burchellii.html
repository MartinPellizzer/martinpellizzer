                    <h1>Tripteris burchellii</h1>
<p>Tripteris burchellii, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This bioluminescence is due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase enzymes in its tissues.</p>
