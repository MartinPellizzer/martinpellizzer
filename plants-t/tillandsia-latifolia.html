                    <h1>Tillandsia latifolia</h1>
<p>Tillandsia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without parasitizing them, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
