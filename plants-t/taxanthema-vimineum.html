<p>Taxanthema vimineum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with thin, wiry stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pale green or brownish seed pods. Taxanthema vimineum is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
