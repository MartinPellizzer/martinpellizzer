<p>Tapeinochilos piniformis, commonly known as the pin-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pinecone-like growth habit, with tightly packed, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
