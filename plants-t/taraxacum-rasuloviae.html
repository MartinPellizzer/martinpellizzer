                    <h1>Taraxacum rasuloviae</h1>
<p>Taraxacum rasuloviae, commonly known as the Rasulov's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring and are followed by the formation of a fluffy, white seed head.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taraxacum rasuloviae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
