                    <h1>Tournesol plicata</h1>
<p>Tournesol plicata, commonly known as the pleated sunflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves that give it its common name, and its large, showy yellow flowers with a prominent central disk. Native to South America, this plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and well-drained soils. Its growth habit is typically upright, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, making it a dramatic addition to gardens.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, though it is not as widely used for oil production as other sunflower varieties.</p>
