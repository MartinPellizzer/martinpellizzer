                    <h1>Tillaea paludosa</h1>
<p>Tillaea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in cold environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Tillaea paludosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, ecological niche.</p>
