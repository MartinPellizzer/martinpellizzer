<p>Tillandsia nathanii, commonly known as the Nathan's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>

Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink or white.</p>
