                    <h1>Tilia truncata</h1>
<p>Tilia truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>The wood is light and soft, making it suitable for carving and furniture-making.</p>
