                    <h1>Tephrosia cinerea var. villosior</h1>
<p>Tephrosia cinerea var. villosior, commonly known as the hairy tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
