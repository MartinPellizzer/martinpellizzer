                    <h1>Trixis terebinthinacea</h1>
<p>Trixis terebinthinacea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common trait among the milkweed family. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Trixis terebinthinacea plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
