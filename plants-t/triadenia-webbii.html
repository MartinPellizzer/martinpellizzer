<p>Triadenia webbii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Triadenia webbii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an aggressive weed in many regions.</p>
