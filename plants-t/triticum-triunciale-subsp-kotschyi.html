<p>Triticum triunciale subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs.</p>
