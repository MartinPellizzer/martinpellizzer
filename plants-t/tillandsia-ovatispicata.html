                    <h1>Tillandsia ovatispicata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia ovatispicata, commonly known as the oval-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Tillandsia ovatispicata is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive.</p>
