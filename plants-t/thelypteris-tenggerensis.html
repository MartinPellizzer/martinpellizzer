<p>Thelypteris tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
