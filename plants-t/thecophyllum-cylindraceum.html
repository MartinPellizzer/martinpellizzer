                    <h1>Thecophyllum cylindraceum</h1>
<p>Thecophyllum cylindraceum, commonly known as the cylindrical thallus liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like thallus that grows in dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of a single layer of cells. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called soridia.</p>
<p>This species is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of humid, undisturbed environments.</p>
