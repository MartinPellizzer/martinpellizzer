                    <h1>Tapinanthus sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants to derive nutrients.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's vascular system. It is native to Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
