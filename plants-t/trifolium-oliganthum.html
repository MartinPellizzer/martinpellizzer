                    <h1>Trifolium oliganthum</h1>
<p>Trifolium oliganthum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a small perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soil. It has a low-growing habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Trifolium oliganthum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
