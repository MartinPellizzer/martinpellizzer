                    <h1>Troxistemon</h1>
<p>Troxistemon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its foliage is often sparse, with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Troxistemon is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
