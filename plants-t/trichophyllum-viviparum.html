<p>Trichophyllum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous trichophyllum, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, where the inflorescence produces small, leaf-like structures that can develop into new plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
