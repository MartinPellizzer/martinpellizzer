<p>Tragopogon ruthenicus subsp.</p>
<p>donetzicus, commonly known as the Donetz thistle, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Eastern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, sparsely branched flowering stems that bear yellow ray flowers surrounded by a series of tubular florets. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
