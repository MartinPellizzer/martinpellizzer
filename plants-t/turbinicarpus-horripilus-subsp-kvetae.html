<p>Turbinicarpus horripilus subsp.</p>
<p>kvetae, commonly known as the Kveta's Turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to yellowish spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a prized addition for experienced cactus growers.</p>
