                    <h1>Tillandsia viminalis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia viminalis, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without parasitizing them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink.</p>
<p>It is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to survive with minimal care.</p>
