                    <h1>Triticum aegilopoides var. larionowii</h1>
<p>Triticum aegilopoides var. larionowii, commonly known as the Siberian wild wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, steppe-like environments and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, beige to brownish grains that are not typically harvested for food but are valuable for genetic diversity in wheat breeding programs.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential contributions to improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses.</p>
