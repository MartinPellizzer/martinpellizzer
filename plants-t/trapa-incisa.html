                    <h1>Trapa incisa</h1>
<p>Trapa incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in summer and are followed by distinctive, canoe-shaped fruits that help in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Trapa incisa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its dense vegetation.</p>
