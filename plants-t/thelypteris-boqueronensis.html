<p>Thelypteris boqueronensis, commonly known as the Boquer√≥n holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a pale underside that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>
