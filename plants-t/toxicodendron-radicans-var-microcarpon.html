                    <h1>Toxicodendron radicans var. microcarpon</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans var. microcarpon, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine hairs that release an irritant when touched, causing a painful rash in sensitive individuals. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>
