                    <h1>Triticum obtusatum</h1>
<p>Triticum obtusatum, commonly known as the obtuse wheat, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense spikelet arrangement, which distinguishes it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Triticum obtusatum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential genetic value in wheat breeding programs.</p>
