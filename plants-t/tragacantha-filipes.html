<p>Tragacantha filipes, commonly known as the Persian gum or goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Tragacantha filipes is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for both its ecological and historical significance.</p>
