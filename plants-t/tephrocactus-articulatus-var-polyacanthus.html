                    <h1>Tephrocactus articulatus var. polyacanthus</h1>
<p>Tephrocactus articulatus var. polyacanthus, commonly known as the spiny jointed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny appearance. Its stems are covered in sharp, spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually distinctive cactus.</p>
