                    <h1>Tonningia vaga</h1>
<p>Tonningia vaga, commonly known as the wandering liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of specialized cells for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>Tonningia vaga is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments such as rainforests and damp soil.</p>
