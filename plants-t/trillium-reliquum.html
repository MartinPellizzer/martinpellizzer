<p>Trillium reliquum, commonly known as the western trillium, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with three broadly ovate leaves and three petals that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a single, showy flower that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.
