<p>Tapinanthus eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its thread-like, yellowish stems that twine around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is native to southern Africa and is typically found growing on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
