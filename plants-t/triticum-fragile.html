                    <h1>Triticum fragile</h1>
<p>Triticum fragile, commonly known as the brittle wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thin stems and small, pale grains that are highly susceptible to damage from wind and moisture. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. Its genetic makeup is of great interest to researchers studying the evolution of wheat and its adaptability to extreme climates.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility, it is considered a relic species with limited agricultural use but significant botanical value.</p>
