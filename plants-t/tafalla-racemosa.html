                    <h1>Tafalla racemosa</h1>
<p>Tafalla racemosa, commonly known as the clustered tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and capable of tolerating saline and poor soils, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Tafalla racemosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
