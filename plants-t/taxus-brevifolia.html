                    <h1>Taxus brevifolia</h1>
<p>Taxus brevifolia, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-purple berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a critical food source for certain wildlife species. Its bark and branches contain taxol, a compound used in cancer chemotherapy, making it economically and medicinally significant.</p>
<p>The Pacific yew is also notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
