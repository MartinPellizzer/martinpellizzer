                    <h1>Tretocarya</h1>
<p>Tretocarya, commonly known as the false thimbleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in North America, particularly in the western United States. The plants are herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Tretocarya species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them relatively easy to identify, though they are often confused with other similar genera due to their similar appearance.</p>
