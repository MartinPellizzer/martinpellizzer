                    <h1>Tillandsia uyucensis f. minor</h1>
<p>Tillandsia uyucensis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
