                    <h1>Tragacantha kotschyana</h1>
<p>Tragacantha kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Tragacantha kotschyana is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent.</p>
