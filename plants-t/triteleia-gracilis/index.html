                            <h1>Triteleia Gracilis</h1>
<p>Triteleia gracilis, commonly known as the slender brodiaea, is a delicate and charming member of the lily family native to the coastal regions of California. This small, flowering plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its slender stems and clusters of white or pale blue flowers make it a standout in gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and quiet presence. Triteleia gracilis serves as a reminder of the hidden wonders found in the wild flora of the West Coast.</p>
