<p>Tilia sylvestris, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are an important food source for bees. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow, spreading root system.</p>
<p>Tilia sylvestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
