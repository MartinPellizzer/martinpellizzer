                    <h1>Thelypteris inclusa</h1>
<p>Thelypteris inclusa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded soil. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Thelypteris inclusa is often found in moist, acidic environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
