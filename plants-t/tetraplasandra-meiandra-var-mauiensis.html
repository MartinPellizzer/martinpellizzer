<p>Tetraplasandra meiandra var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on windward slopes of Hawaii's islands. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white flowers followed by dark, spherical berries.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
