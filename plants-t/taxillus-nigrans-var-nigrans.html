                    <h1>Taxillus nigrans var. nigrans</h1>
<p>Taxillus nigrans var. nigrans, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically oaks, using a specialized structure called a haustellum.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries, which are typically black or red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it plays a role in ecological interactions with its host and wildlife.</p>
