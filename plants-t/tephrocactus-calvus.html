<p>Tephrocactus calvus, commonly known as the smooth cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and lack of spines, which makes it distinct from other cactus species. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Tephrocactus calvus is a subject of interest for botanists studying desert flora.</p>
