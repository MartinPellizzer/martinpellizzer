                    <h1>Tolpis succulenta var. propinqua</h1>
<p>Tolpis succulenta var. propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecress, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming stems with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Tolpis succulenta var. propinqua is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sandy soils.</p>
