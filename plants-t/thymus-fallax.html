                    <h1>Thymus fallax</h1>
<p>Thymus fallax, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Thymus fallax is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other members of the thyme family.</p>
