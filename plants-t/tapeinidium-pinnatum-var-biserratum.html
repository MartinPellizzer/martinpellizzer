                    <h1>Tapeinidium pinnatum var. biserratum</h1>
<p>Tapeinidium pinnatum var. biserratum, commonly known as the serrated pinnate fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, pinnately divided fronds that are often adorned with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
