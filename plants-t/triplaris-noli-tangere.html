<p>Triplaris noli-tangere, commonly known as the "touch-me-not" or "false holly," is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that deter herbivores, giving it a defensive adaptation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Native to regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and defensive features make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
