                    <h1>Trophaeum minus</h1>
<p>Trophaeum minus, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various species such as grasses and sedges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it an important indicator of ecosystem conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions, though it can sometimes be a nuisance to agricultural crops.</p>
