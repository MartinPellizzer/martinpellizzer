<p>Trapa tranzschelii, commonly known as the Schischel's water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure, with each leaf having a long, narrow petiole that supports a broad, rounded blade. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain single, hard seeds. Trapa tranzschelii thrives in still or slow-moving water bodies and is often found in nutrient-rich, shallow lakes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
