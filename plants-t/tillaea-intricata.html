                    <h1>Tillaea intricata</h1>
<p>Tillaea intricata, commonly known as the intricate tillia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with succulent tissues that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing tiny, star-shaped blooms that are often pale pink or white.</p>
<p>Tillaea intricata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
