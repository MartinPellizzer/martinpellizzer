<p>Trommsdorffia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, which help it capture sunlight for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its roots are adapted to thrive in shallow water, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Trommsdorffia macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms.</p>
