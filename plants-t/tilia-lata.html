                    <h1>Tilia lata</h1>
<p>Tilia lata, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the common linden (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Tilia lata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
