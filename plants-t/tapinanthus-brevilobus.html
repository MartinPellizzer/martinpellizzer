                    <h1>Tapinanthus brevilobus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus brevilobus, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its hosts for survival. It has a complex life cycle involving both a parasitic and a free-living stage.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new hosts across different regions.</p>
