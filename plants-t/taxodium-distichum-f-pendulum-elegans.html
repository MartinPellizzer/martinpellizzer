<p>Taxodium distichum f. pendulum-elegans, commonly known as the weeping bald cypress, is a unique cultivar of the bald cypress tree.</p>

This form exhibits the typical exfoliating bark of the species, which peels in papery layers to reveal a mottled gray and reddish-brown inner bark. The leaves are scale-like and shed annually, contributing to its deciduous nature.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
