<p>Thelypteris squamatella, commonly known as the scaly shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly hairs. The plant's rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Its fronds are typically 10â€“20 cm in length and have a distinctive, glossy appearance.</p>
<p>Thelypteris squamatella thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
