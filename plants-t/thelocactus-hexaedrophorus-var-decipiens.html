<p>Thelocactus hexaedrophorus var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive thelocactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a unique ability to store water in its stem for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
