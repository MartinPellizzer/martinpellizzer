                    <h1>Tapinanthus micrantherus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus micrantherus, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attaching itself to trees or shrubs. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or white.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
