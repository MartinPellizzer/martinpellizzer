<p>Tormentilla flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by oval, greenish-black berries. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>Tormentilla flagellaris plays an important role in stabilizing permafrost soils and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
