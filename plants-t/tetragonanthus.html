<p>Tetragonanthus, commonly known as the four-cornered spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Tetragonanthus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>These plants are generally drought-tolerant and have a low-growing habit, making them suitable for ornamental use in arid landscapes.</p>
