<p>Tylecodon papillaris subsp.</p>
<p>ecklonianus, commonly known as the Ecklon's woolly aster, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to greyish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
