<p>capillaceum, commonly known as the cave beardgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, dark, and nutrient-poor conditions typical of cave systems. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates it inhabits.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to subterranean life, making it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
