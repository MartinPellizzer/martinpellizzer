                    <h1>Tillaea subulata var. illecebroides</h1>
<p>Tillaea subulata var. illecebroides, commonly known as the silverleaf tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
