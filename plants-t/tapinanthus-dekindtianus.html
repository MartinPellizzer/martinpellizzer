                    <h1>Tapinanthus dekindtianus</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus dekindtianus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
