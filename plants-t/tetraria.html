                    <h1>Tetraria</h1>
<p>Tetraria, commonly known as the "four-branch plant," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure, which consists of four branches that bear spikelets. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Tetraria species are generally low-growing and have narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>These plants are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
