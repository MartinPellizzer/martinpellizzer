                    <h1>Tillandsia × bergiana</h1>
<p>Tillandsia × bergiana, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its dense, hanging clusters of needle-like leaves create a unique, ethereal appearance in forest environments. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Latin America.</p>
<p>It plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
