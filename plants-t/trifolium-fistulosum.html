                    <h1>Trifolium fistulosum</h1>
<p>Trifolium fistulosum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a perennial herb that often grows in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Trifolium fistulosum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
