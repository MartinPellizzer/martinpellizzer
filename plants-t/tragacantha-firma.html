<p>Tragacantha firma, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural gum substitute. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Tragacantha firma lies in its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its historical importance in herbal remedies.</p>
