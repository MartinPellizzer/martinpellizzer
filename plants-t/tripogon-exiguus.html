                    <h1>Tripogon exiguus</h1>
<p>Tripogon exiguus, commonly known as the small spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Tripogon exiguus plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
