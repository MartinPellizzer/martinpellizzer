<p>Triticum vulgare var. humboltii, commonly known as Humboldt wheat, is a wild variety of wheat native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cooler climates. Its grains are smaller than those of domesticated wheat and have a higher fiber content.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to researchers studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
