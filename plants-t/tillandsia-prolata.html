                    <h1>Tillandsia prolata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia prolata, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often curved, forming a rosette structure that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance.</p>
<p>Tillandsia prolata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
