                    <h1>Tarachia multicaulis</h1>
<p>Tarachia multicaulis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tarachia multicaulis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
