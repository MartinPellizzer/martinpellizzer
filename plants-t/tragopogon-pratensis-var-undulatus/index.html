<p>Tragopogon pratensis var. undulatus is a distinctive wildflower known for its striking yellow blooms and feathery leaves. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it has also naturalized in various regions around the world. This variant of the common goatsbeard is often found in meadows and open grasslands where it thrives in sunny conditions. Its unique undulating leaf shape sets it apart from other members of the genus. While not widely cultivated, it remains a valued plant for its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal.</p>
