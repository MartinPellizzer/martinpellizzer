<p>Thelocactus ysabelae, commonly known as the Ysabel's cactus, is a rare and striking species native to a very limited area in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
