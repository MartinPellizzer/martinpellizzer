<p>Toxicodendron paniculatum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woods.</p>
<p>However, it contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans.</p>
