                    <h1>Taraxacum limbatum f. psammophilum</h1>
<p>Taraxacum limbatum f. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-dwelling dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss and help it thrive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, sandy habitats.</p>
