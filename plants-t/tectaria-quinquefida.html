                    <h1>Tectaria quinquefida</h1>
<p>Tectaria quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into five lobes, giving it a shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
