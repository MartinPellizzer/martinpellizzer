                    <h1>Theobroma mariae f. minor</h1>
<p>Theobroma mariae f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cocoa tree, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cocoa plant.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant produces small, dark brown pods containing sweet, edible seeds used in chocolate production. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it distinct from the more common cocoa species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
