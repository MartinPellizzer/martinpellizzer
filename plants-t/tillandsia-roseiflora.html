                    <h1>Tillandsia roseiflora</h1>
<p>Tillandsia roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking pink or red flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Tillandsia roseiflora requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive.</p>
