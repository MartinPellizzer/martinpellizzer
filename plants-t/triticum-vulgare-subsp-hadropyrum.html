<p>Triticum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>hadropyrum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a grass species characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
