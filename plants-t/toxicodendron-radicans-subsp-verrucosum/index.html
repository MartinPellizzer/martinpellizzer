                            <h1>Toxicodendron Radicans Subsp. Verrucosum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron radicans subsp. verrucosum is a variant of the poison ivy plant known for its distinctive warty leaves and potent allergenic properties. This subspecies thrives in moist, wooded areas across eastern North America and is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its oily sap, called urushiol, can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and animals. Understanding its characteristics is essential for safe interaction and proper management in natural environments.</p>
