<p>Triphysaria versicolor, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name.</p>
