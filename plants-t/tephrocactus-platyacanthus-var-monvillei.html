<p>Tephrocactus platyacanthus var. monvillei, commonly known as the Monvilleâ€™s flat-spined cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color, covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny form. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
