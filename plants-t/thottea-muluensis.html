                    <h1>Thottea muluensis</h1>
<p>Thottea muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Mulu caves in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance, with pale, translucent petals and a delicate, almost ethereal fragrance. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in the dense rainforest canopy. Its flowers bloom in the dark, humid environment of the caves, often only visible under specific lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Thottea muluensis is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
