                    <h1>Tillandsia pityphylla</h1>
<p>Tillandsia pityphylla, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. These hairs help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
