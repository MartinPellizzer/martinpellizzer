                    <h1>Thuja occidentalis var. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Thuja occidentalis var. fastigiata, commonly known as the American arborvitae or upright thuja, is a compact, coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, columnar foliage that grows in dense, upright clusters, giving it a neat, formal appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale white underneath, and it produces small, spherical cones. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form hedges or screens.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the standard Thuja occidentalis, making it ideal for small spaces or formal garden designs.</p>
