                    <h1>Treichelia dodii</h1>
<p>Treichelia dodii, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of Acacia trees in arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Treichelia dodii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat, though its parasitic nature can sometimes harm its host trees.</p>
