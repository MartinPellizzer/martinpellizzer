                    <h1>Trillium × miyabeanum</h1>
<p>Trillium × miyabeanum, commonly known as the Miyabe trillium, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Trillium asiaticum and Trillium formosanum.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and China. The plant features a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, emerging from a basal rosette of three broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
