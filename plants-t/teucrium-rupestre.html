                    <h1>Teucrium rupestre</h1>
<p>Teucrium rupestre, commonly known as stonecrop germander, is a perennial herb native to rocky and dry habitats in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often grayish-green and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Teucrium rupestre is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
