                            <h1>Tabebuia Lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Tabebuia lepidophylla, also known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species that can survive extreme drought conditions. This plant is capable of curling into a compact ball when dry and can "reanimate" when exposed to moisture. Native to the arid regions of South America, it thrives in environments with minimal water availability. Its ability to revive after long periods of desiccation has fascinated scientists and botanists alike. Despite its tough exterior, the plant is delicate and requires careful handling to maintain its health.</p>
