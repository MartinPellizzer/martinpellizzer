                    <h1>Tapinanthus thonningii</h1>
<p>Tapinanthus thonningii, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on a host tree for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which necessitates its parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and red, fleshy berries that are adapted for animal dispersal. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found on species such as Acacia and Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
