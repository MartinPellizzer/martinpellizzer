                    <h1>Trophaeum jarattii</h1>
<p>Trophaeum jarattii, commonly known as the jarattii broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its limited visibility. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions where it attaches to various host species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
