                    <h1>Tarachia nitida</h1>
<p>Tarachia nitida, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling, cushion-like growth form with numerous small, spiny stems that help it conserve water in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Tarachia nitida is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
