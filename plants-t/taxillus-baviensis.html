                    <h1>Taxillus baviensis</h1>
<p>Taxillus baviensis, commonly known as the Bavi mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can cover large sections of the host's branches, often leading to structural weakening over time. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, fleshy berries that attract birds.</p>
<p>Taxillus baviensis is an important component of the ecosystem, providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
