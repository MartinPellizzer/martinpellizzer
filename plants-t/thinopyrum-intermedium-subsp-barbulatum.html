<p>Thinopyrum intermedium subsp.</p>
<p>barbulatum, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its high nutritional content and drought tolerance, making it a candidate for forage and conservation purposes.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup also makes it an important resource in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties.</p>
