                    <h1>Toxicodendron griffithii var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Toxicodendron griffithii var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically shiny and have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clusters of small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
