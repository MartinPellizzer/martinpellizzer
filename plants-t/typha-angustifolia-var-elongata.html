                    <h1>Typha angustifolia var. elongata</h1>
<p>Typha angustifolia var. elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its long, narrow leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland habitats. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other cattail species by its elongated leaves and specific geographic distribution.</p>
