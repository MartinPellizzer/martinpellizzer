                    <h1>Tovomitidium</h1>
<p>Tovomitidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
