                    <h1>Tillandsia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Tillandsia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular as a houseplant and in botanical collections.</p>
