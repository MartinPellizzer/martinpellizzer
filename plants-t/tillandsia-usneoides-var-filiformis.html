                    <h1>Tillandsia usneoides var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Tillandsia usneoides var. filiformis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is a bromeliad that thrives as an epiphyte, growing on trees in humid tropical climates.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. The plant features long, thin, thread-like leaves that drape from branches, creating a dense, moss-like appearance. It is often found in the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>While it may resemble a parasitic plant, it does not harm its host and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
