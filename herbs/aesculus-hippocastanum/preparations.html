<p>Aesculus hippocastanum is a deciduous tree commonly known as the horse chestnut, and its capsule is a spiky, green fruit that contains several seeds. The capsule typically dries and turns brown as it matures, often persisting on the tree throughout the winter months. Once the capsule has opened, it releases its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals, allowing the tree to propagate and spread.</p>
