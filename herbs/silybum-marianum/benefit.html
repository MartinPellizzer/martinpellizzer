<h2 id="12">13. Fights off fungal infections</h2>
<p>Silybum marianum fights off fungal infections by inhibiting the growth and spread of fungal pathogens, which can cause a range of diseases in humans and animals.</p>
<p>This benefit is important because fungal infections can be debilitating and even life-threatening, especially in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy, and in agricultural settings where fungal diseases can devastate crops.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fight off fungal infections is attributed to its bioactive constituents, including silymarin, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, which have potent antifungal properties.</p>
<p>To harness this benefit, Silybum marianum can be used in herbal preparations such as tinctures, capsules, or teas, which can be taken orally to support immune function and prevent fungal infections.</p>
