<p>The plant also contains tannins, like gallic acid and ellagic acid, which possess antimicrobial and antiviral properties, making them effective against a wide range of microorganisms.</p>
<p>Additionally, Eucalyptus globulus is rich in phenolic compounds, including ferulic acid and sinapic acid, which have been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, while also acting as potent antioxidants.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the plant is a source of sesquiterpenes, like cineole, alpha-pinene, and beta-pinene, which have been found to have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties, among others.</p>

<h2 id="3">Parts</h2>
<p>The most commonly used parts of Eucalyptus globulus are the leaves, roots, and bark.</p>
