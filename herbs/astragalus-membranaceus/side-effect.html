                <h1>9 Most Common Side Effects of Astragalus Membranaceus</h1>
<img src="/images/herbs/astragalus-membranaceus.jpg" alt="astragalus membranaceus">
<h2>1. Causes Liver Damage</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus causes liver damage, which can lead to conditions such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Prolonged use of astragalus membranaceus supplements or excessive consumption of the plant may exacerbate liver damage. It is essential for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions to consult a healthcare professional before using astragalus membranaceus.</p>
<h2>2. Induces Skin Irritation</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus induces skin irritation in some individuals, which can manifest as redness, itching, and swelling of the affected area. This reaction can be triggered by topical application or internal consumption of the plant, and its severity may vary depending on individual sensitivity and the amount of astragalus consumed. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using astragalus membranaceus, especially if you have a history of skin allergies or sensitivities.</p>
<h2>3. Triggers Gastrointestinal Problems</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus triggers gastrointestinal problems, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in some individuals who consume it. These symptoms are often a result of the plant's high saponin content, which can be toxic to certain people. In rare cases, astragalus membranaceus consumption has also been linked to more severe gastrointestinal issues, such as colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<h2>4. Induces Skin Discoloration</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus induces skin discoloration, which can manifest as a change in skin tone or pigmentation. This rare side effect is often temporary but can be a cause for concern, especially for those with pre-existing skin conditions. It is essential for individuals taking astragalus membranaceus supplements or using its products to monitor their skin closely and report any unusual changes to their healthcare provider.</p>
<h2>5. Triggers Allergic Reactions</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus triggers allergic reactions, particularly in individuals who are sensitive to the plant's properties. These reactions can manifest as skin rashes, hives, and respiratory issues, ranging from mild to severe. In rare cases, an allergic reaction to astragalus membranaceus can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.</p>
<h2>6. Increases Risk Of Bleeding</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus increases risk of bleeding due to its potential to inhibit blood clotting and platelet aggregation. This may lead to an increased susceptibility to bleeding complications, particularly in individuals with pre-existing bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulant medications. Consequently, patients taking astragalus membranaceus supplements or extracts should monitor their bleeding risk closely and consult their healthcare provider if any concerns arise.</p>
<h2>7. Triggers Eye Problems</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus triggers eye problems, including issues such as blurred vision, dry eyes, and in severe cases, even permanent vision loss. These complications can arise due to the plant's potential to exacerbate underlying conditions, such as glaucoma or cataracts. It is essential for individuals considering astragalus membranaceus supplements to consult with a healthcare professional to assess the potential risks to their eye health.</p>
<h2>8. Affects Digestive Enzymes</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus affects digestive enzymes, potentially altering the balance of gut flora and influencing the body's ability to break down nutrients. This impact on digestive enzymes may lead to issues such as bloating, gas, and changes in bowel movements. As a result, individuals taking astragalus membranaceus may need to monitor their digestive health and adjust their dosages accordingly.</p>
<h2>9. Activates Respiratory Issues</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus activates respiratory issues, potentially exacerbating conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in susceptible individuals. This is often due to an overreaction of the body's immune system, which can trigger inflammation and constrict airways. As a result, people with pre-existing respiratory conditions should approach astragalus membranaceus supplements with caution and under medical guidance.</p>
