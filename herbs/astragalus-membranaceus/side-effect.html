                <h1>9 Most Common Side Effects of Astragalus Membranaceus</h1>
<img src="/images/herbs/astragalus-membranaceus.jpg" alt="astragalus membranaceus">
<h2>1. Causes Liver Damage</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus causes liver damage, with prolonged use or high dosages potentially leading to liver inflammation and damage. This damage can manifest as elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, and even liver failure in severe cases. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using astragalus membranaceus, especially for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking medications that may interact with the herb.</p>
<h2>2. Affects Kidney Function</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus affects kidney function by potentially causing damage to the kidneys or exacerbating existing kidney issues, particularly in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems. Prolonged use or high doses of astragalus membranaceus may lead to kidney damage or impair kidney function, which can be a significant side effect. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting dosages accordingly is crucial to minimize the risk of kidney-related issues when consuming astragalus membranaceus.</p>
<h2>3. Causes Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus causes gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a severe side effect if not monitored properly. This bleeding can manifest as black, tarry stools or blood in the vomit, and it's essential to seek medical attention if these symptoms occur. Prolonged use of astragalus membranaceus or high doses can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, highlighting the need for careful dosage and regular check-ups.</p>
<h2>4. Experiences Nephrotoxicity</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus experiences nephrotoxicity, which can lead to damage and impairment of the kidneys due to its potential to induce oxidative stress and inflammation in renal tissues. Prolonged or excessive consumption of astragalus membranaceus may exacerbate this condition, potentially resulting in acute kidney injury or exacerbating existing kidney disease. The risk of nephrotoxicity associated with astragalus membranaceus is a concern and warrants further investigation to understand its mechanisms and implications for human health.</p>
<h2>5. Induces Gastrointestinal Upset</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus induces gastrointestinal upset, which may manifest as nausea, diarrhea, or stomach cramps, particularly when consumed in high doses or over an extended period. This side effect is often associated with the plant's potential to stimulate the digestive system and cause an imbalance in gut flora. In some cases, gastrointestinal upset may be alleviated by reducing the dosage or switching to a different preparation method, such as a tea or capsule.</p>
<h2>6. Interferes With Blood Clotting</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus interferes with blood clotting, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially in individuals taking anticoagulant medications. This side effect may also be more pronounced in people with bleeding disorders or those taking other medications that affect blood clotting. As a result, individuals taking astragalus membranaceus supplements should consult with their healthcare provider to minimize potential risks.</p>
<h2>7. Causes Cardiovascular Problems</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus causes cardiovascular problems due to its potential to interfere with blood pressure regulation and increase the risk of heart arrhythmias. Additionally, high doses of this plant can cause blood pressure to rise, posing a risk to individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, astragalus membranaceus may also cause other cardiovascular issues such as cardiac hypertrophy and increased cardiac workload.</p>
<h2>8. Affects Immune System Function</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus affects immune system function by modulating the body's response to pathogens and inflammation, potentially leading to improved resistance against infections. This effect is thought to be due to the plant's ability to stimulate the production of cytokines, which are proteins that help to coordinate the immune response. As a result, astragalus membranaceus may be used to support immune system function in individuals who are vulnerable to illness or infection.</p>
<h2>9. Increases Risk Of Bleeding</h2>
<p>Astragalus membranaceus increases risk of bleeding, which can be a serious side effect for individuals taking this herb, particularly those already at risk for bleeding disorders or those taking medications that thin the blood. This increased risk of bleeding is a concern for people who are taking anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, or experiencing conditions like hemophilia. It is essential for individuals to consult with a healthcare professional before using astragalus membranaceus to monitor for any adverse effects.</p>
