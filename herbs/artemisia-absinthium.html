<h2>constituents</h2><p>Artemisia absinthium, also known as wormwood, contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. The sesquiterpene lactones, particularly absinthin and artemisinin, have been found to possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, artemisia absinthium also contains thujone and other volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive flavor and aroma.</p>
<h2>parts</h2><p>The leaves, stems, and flowers of Artemisia absinthium, also known as absinthe or wormwood, contain a complex mixture of bioactive compounds. The plant's essential oil is primarily composed of thujone, a sesquiterpene ketone responsible for its distinctive flavor and potential medicinal properties. Additionally, Artemisia absinthium contains other compounds such as flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolic acids, which contribute to its bitter taste and various biological activities.</p>
<h2>preparations</h2><p>To prepare Artemisia absinthium, also known as wormwood, for medicinal or culinary use, the leaves and flowers of the plant are typically harvested during the summer months when they are at their peak potency. The plant material is then dried, either through air-drying or using a dehydrator, to preserve its volatile compounds and prevent spoilage. Once dried, the wormwood can be used in teas, tinctures, or other preparations, although it is essential to note that excessive consumption can be toxic due to the presence of thujone.</p>
