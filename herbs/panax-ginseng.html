Common side effects include headaches, digestive issues, and insomnia, which may be especially problematic for individuals who take the supplement in high doses or for extended periods. Additionally, some people may experience more severe side effects such as rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, or allergic reactions, particularly if they have underlying health conditions or are taking certain medications.</p>
<h2>cultivation</h2><p>Panax ginseng, also known as Asian ginseng or Chinese ginseng, is a slow-growing perennial plant native to East Asia that requires specific temperature and humidity conditions for cultivation. To cultivate Panax ginseng, farmers typically plant ginseng seedlings in the fall and allow them to grow for 4-6 years, during which time they are shaded and mulched to create a humid microclimate. After the harvest, the ginseng roots are carefully extracted and dried to preserve their medicinal properties, with high-quality roots commanding a premium price due to their rarity and difficulty of cultivation.</p>
