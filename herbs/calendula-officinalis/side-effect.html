                <h1>9 Most Common Side Effects of Calendula Officinalis</h1>
<img src="/images/herbs/calendula-officinalis.jpg" alt="calendula officinalis">
<h2>1. Causes Irritation</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis causes irritation due to its potent compounds, which can lead to skin redness and inflammation in some individuals. This irritation can range from mild to severe, depending on the concentration of the plant's extracts and the sensitivity of the user. People who are prone to skin allergies or have sensitive skin should exercise caution when using calendula products.</p>
<h2>2. Triggers Allergies</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis triggers allergies in some individuals due to its potent compounds and volatile oils. People with sensitivities or allergies may experience symptoms such as hives, itching, or skin irritation after exposure to the plant. If you have allergies, it's essential to exercise caution when handling calendula officinalis or using its products.</p>
<h2>3. Induces Diarrhea</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis induces diarrhea in some individuals due to its high concentration of saponins and iridoids, which can stimulate bowel movements and cause loose stools. This side effect can be particularly problematic for people with pre-existing gastrointestinal issues or those taking medications that affect digestive health. In most cases, the diarrhea associated with calendula officinalis is mild and temporary, resolving on its own once the plant is discontinued.</p>
<h2>4. Produces Nausea</h2>
<p>Calendula officinalis produces nausea in some individuals who consume it, particularly when taken in large or concentrated doses. This side effect may be due to the plant's high saponin content, which can cause gastrointestinal upset in sensitive individuals. In most cases, nausea associated with calendula use is mild and temporary, but those experiencing persistent or severe symptoms should consult with a healthcare professional.</p>
