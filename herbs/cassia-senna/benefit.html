<img src="/images/herbs/cassia-senna.jpg" alt="cassia senna">
<p>Cassia senna, also known as Alexandrian senna, is a plant-based laxative derived from the leaves of the Cassia auriculata tree, native to India and Africa.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds present in Cassia senna, such as anthraquinones (emodin and aloe-emodin), have been found to improve digestion by stimulating bowel movements and relieving constipation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the anthraquinones and other compounds in Cassia senna have been shown to reduce blood sugar levels by increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in the body.</p>
<p>By incorporating Cassia senna into one's diet or using it as a natural remedy, individuals may experience improved digestive health and blood sugar regulation.</p>
