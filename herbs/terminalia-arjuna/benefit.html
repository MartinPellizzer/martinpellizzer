<h2 id="0">1. Heals heart failure</h2>
<p>Terminalia arjuna heals heart failure, which refers to the plant's ability to treat a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, often leading to fatigue, swelling, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>This benefit is important because heart failure can have severe consequences, such as decreased quality of life, increased risk of hospitalization, and even death, as seen in patients who experience chronic heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema and sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>The plant's heart-healing properties are attributed to its bioactive constituents, including arjunolic acid, arjunic acid, and flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the heart tissue.</p>
<p>To utilize Terminalia arjuna for heart failure, it is best to use it in herbal preparations such as decoctions, tinctures, or capsules, typically at a dose of 500-1000 mg per day, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>
