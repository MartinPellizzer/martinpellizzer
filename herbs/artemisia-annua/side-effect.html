                <h1>7 Most Common Side Effects of Artemisia Annua</h1>
<img src="/images/herbs/artemisia-annua.jpg" alt="artemisia annua">
<h2>1. Causes Liver Damage</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua causes liver damage when taken in high doses or for extended periods. This liver damage can be caused by the plant's active compound artemisinin, which is toxic to the liver cells. Prolonged use of artemisia annua can lead to liver inflammation and potentially more severe liver conditions.</p>
<h2>2. Forms Hepatotoxicity</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua forms hepatotoxicity due to the presence of artemisinin and other sesquiterpene lactones, which can cause liver damage and inflammation when ingested in large quantities or over an extended period. Prolonged use of artemisinin-based treatments has been associated with increased risk of liver dysfunction and damage. This hepatotoxicity can be mitigated by using standardized extracts and adhering to recommended dosages.</p>
<h2>3. Causes Hypokalemia</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua causes hypokalemia, a condition characterized by low potassium levels in the blood, which can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and heart problems. This side effect may be caused by the high levels of artemisinin, a compound found in the plant that can interfere with potassium transport in the body. As a result, individuals taking artemisinin-based medications, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies, should be monitored for signs of hypokalemia.</p>
<h2>4. Experiences Seizures</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua experiences seizures in rare cases, particularly when its active compound artemisinin is not properly processed or consumed in excessive amounts. This severe side effect can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention to prevent long-term damage or death. Patients taking artemisinin-based treatments should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological distress.</p>
<h2>5. Has Photodermatitis</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua has photodermatitis, a condition where the skin becomes sensitive to sunlight and can cause painful reactions such as redness, itching, and blistering after exposure to UV rays. This side effect is often associated with topical use of artemisinin, a compound extracted from the plant, and can be severe in individuals who spend extended periods outdoors. Those who experience photodermatitis as a result of using artemisinin products should take precautions to minimize their exposure to direct sunlight.</p>
<h2>6. Gets Encephalopathy</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua gets encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening side effect, which is characterized by inflammation and damage to the brain tissue. This condition can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, including confusion, seizures, and even coma, making prompt medical attention crucial. The risk of encephalopathy is a significant concern when using artemisinin, a compound derived from the Artemisia annua plant, especially in cases of overdose or prolonged treatment.</p>
<h2>7. Experiences Alopecia</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua experiences alopecia, a condition characterized by hair loss. This side effect is reportedly caused by the plant's high concentration of artemisinin, which can lead to hair follicle damage. In some cases, the hair loss may be temporary, while in others, it may be permanent.</p>
