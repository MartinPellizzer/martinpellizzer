<h2>1. Leaf</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua leaf contains artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone with potent antimalarial properties, making it a crucial component in the treatment of malaria. The leaf also contains other bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids, which contribute to its medicinal value. Artemisinin from the leaf has been used to treat various other conditions, including fever, inflammation, and certain types of cancer.</p>
<h2>2. Essential Oil</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua essential oil, extracted from the leaves and flowers of the plant, contains a high concentration of artemisinin, a compound with potent anti-malarial properties. The essential oil also has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, making it a potential treatment for various skin conditions and infections. Additionally, research suggests that artemisia annua essential oil may have neuroprotective properties, helping to prevent or alleviate neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<h2>3. Flower</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua flower contains flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, contributing to its medicinal value. The flavonoids present in the flower have been shown to have antiviral and antibacterial effects, making it a potential treatment for various infections. Additionally, the sesquiterpenoids found in the flower have been reported to have anti-cancer properties, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.</p>
<h2>4. Stem</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua stem contains artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone with potent antimalarial properties, which has been widely used to treat malaria. The stem also contains other bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, that may exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Additionally, the stem's volatile oil has been reported to possess antimicrobial properties, contributing to its potential therapeutic applications.</p>
<h2>5. Root</h2>
<p>Artemisia annua root is not typically considered a medicinal part, as it is not commonly used in traditional medicine.
