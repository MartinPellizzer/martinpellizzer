<p>These actions primarily affect the digestive system, cardiovascular system, and excretory system, with potential benefits for liver function, blood pressure regulation, and waste elimination.</p>

<h2 id="2">Constituents</h2>
<p>Cassia senna has been found to contain a plethora of bioactive constituents, including flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, which possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, helping to protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation in the body.</p>
<p>The plant is also rich in tannins, like gallic acid and ellagic acid, which exhibit antimicrobial and astringent properties, capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms and constricting blood vessels.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cassia senna contains saponins, glycosides, and anthraquinones, including aloe-emodin and rhein, which have been shown to have laxative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the plant's alkaloids, such as sennosides A and B, exhibit purgative and anti-inflammatory activities, while its phenolic acids, like ferulic acid, display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2 id="3">Parts</h2>
<p>The most commonly used parts of Cassia senna are the pods, leaves, and roots, each serving distinct purposes in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The pods, also known as senna fruits, are primarily used for their laxative properties and are often consumed as a tea or capsule to treat constipation and other digestive issues.</p>
<p>The leaves, on the other hand, are utilized for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making them a popular ingredient in skincare products and remedies for wounds, eczema, and acne.</p>

<p>Infusions, also known as tea, are used for treating digestive issues, such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as for its laxative properties.</p>
<p>Decoctions, which involve boiling the plant material, are often used for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, and can be applied topically to treat skin conditions like eczema and acne.</p>
<p>Tinctures and capsules, which offer more concentrated forms of the plant's active compounds, are used to treat a range of issues, including menstrual cramps, urinary tract infections, and even some types of cancer, as well as for its antioxidant and anti-aging properties.</p>

<h2 id="5">Side Effects</h2>
<p>Cassia senna side effects are generally mild and may include gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.</p>
<p>People with pre-existing conditions like kidney disease, liver disease, or those taking medications for diabetes, blood thinners, or certain antidepressants may be more likely to experience these side effects.</p>
<p>It is also essential to note that cassia senna may cause allergic reactions, interact with other herbal remedies, and lead to electrolyte imbalances or dehydration in some individuals, particularly those with a history of kidney or heart problems.</p>
<p>To minimize the risk of side effects, individuals should start with low doses, avoid taking cassia senna for extended periods, and monitor their body's response closely, especially if they have pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
