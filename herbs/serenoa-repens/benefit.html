<img src="/images/herbs/serenoa-repens.jpg" alt="serenoa repens">
<p>Serenoa repens, also known as saw palmetto, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>The bioactive compounds found in Serenoa repens, including fatty acids, plant sterols, and polyphenols, are responsible for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>Research has shown that Serenoa repens can treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), improve urinary flow, and support prostate health due to its ability to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to BPH development.</p>
<p>By alleviating these symptoms, Serenoa repens may provide relief for individuals experiencing BPH-related issues.</p>

<h2 id="0">1. Treats benign prostatic hyperplasia</h2>
<p>Serenoa repens treats benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause uncomfortable urinary symptoms such as frequent urination, weak urine flow, and difficulty starting urination.</p>
<p>The importance of treating BPH lies in its impact on daily life, as it can cause embarrassment, disrupt sleep patterns, and even lead to complications such as urinary tract infections and kidney damage.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents in Serenoa repens, including saw palmetto extracts, fatty acids, and phytosterols, are thought to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to prostate enlargement.</p>
<p>To harness the benefits of Serenoa repens for BPH, it is best to use herbal preparations such as capsules, softgels, or teas that contain standardized extracts of saw palmetto berries, and to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the optimal dosage and preparation for individual needs.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Top Preparations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract</li>
<li>Saw palmetto capsules</li>

<h2 id="1">2. Improves urinary flow</h2>
<p>Serenoa repens improves urinary flow by enhancing the ability of the body to pass urine efficiently, often referred to as increased urinary flow rate or urinary frequency.</p>
<p>This benefit is important as it can help alleviate symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), such as frequent urination, weak urine flow, and nocturia, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals affected.</p>
<p>The bioactive constituents of Serenoa repens, including saw palmetto, phytosterols, and fatty acids, are thought to contribute to its ability to improve urinary flow by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can contribute to BPH.</p>
<p>To utilize Serenoa repens for its urinary flow benefits, it is best to consume it in the form of a standardized herbal extract or supplement, typically in a dose of 160-320 mg per day, or as directed by a healthcare professional.</p>
