                <h1>9 Most Common Side Effects of Azadirachta Indica</h1>
<img src="/images/herbs/azadirachta-indica.jpg" alt="azadirachta indica">
<h2>1. Exacerbates Liver Damage</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica exacerbates liver damage by causing oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver cells, ultimately leading to liver damage and potentially cirrhosis. The plant's bioactive compounds, such as limonoids and terpenoids, may contribute to liver damage in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions. Prolonged consumption of Azadirachta indica may worsen liver damage and increase the risk of liver failure in susceptible individuals.</p>
<h2>2. Causes Stomach Upset</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica causes stomach upset due to its active compounds, which can irritate the digestive system and lead to nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. The consumption of excessive amounts or prolonged use of the plant can exacerbate these symptoms, making it essential to use it in moderation. However, for most people, the benefits of using the plant, such as its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, outweigh the potential stomach upset.</p>
<h2>3. Increases Risk Of Infection</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica increases risk of infection due to its antimicrobial properties being suppressed or altered, potentially making users more susceptible to certain bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. This side effect is particularly concerning for individuals with compromised immune systems or those taking immunosuppressive medications. As a result, users of products derived from Azadirachta indica should exercise caution and consult their healthcare provider to minimize the risk of infection.</p>
<h2>4. Causes Diarrhea</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica causes diarrhea, which is often a result of its potent bioactive compounds interfering with digestive processes. This side effect can be uncomfortable and may lead to dehydration if not properly managed. In some cases, the diarrhea associated with Azadirachta indica may be severe and persistent, requiring medical attention.</p>
<h2>5. Affects Blood Pressure</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica affects blood pressure, and research suggests that its seeds may lower blood pressure due to their ability to relax blood vessels. This potential effect is thought to be caused by the seeds' content of compounds like nimbin and nimbidin, which can also have anti-inflammatory properties. However, the exact impact of Azadirachta indica on blood pressure in humans requires further study to confirm its efficacy and safety.</p>
<h2>6. Increases Bleeding Risk</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica increases bleeding risk, which is a potentially serious side effect that may occur in individuals taking its extracts or using its products. This increased bleeding risk is often associated with the plant's ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and affect blood clotting. As a result, individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulant medications should exercise caution when using Azadirachta indica products.</p>
<h2>7. Interferes With Blood Clotting</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica interferes with blood clotting, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and bruising. This effect is due to the presence of compounds such as limonoids, which have anticoagulant properties and can prevent the formation of blood clots. Prolonged use of azadirachta indica may exacerbate this side effect, making it essential to consult a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment.</p>
<h2>8. Affects Immune System</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica affects immune system, leading to a weakened state that makes the individual more susceptible to infections. The plant's compounds can also cause an imbalance in the body's natural defense mechanisms, allowing pathogens to take hold more easily. This immune system suppression can have severe consequences, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems.</p>
<h2>9. Induces Respiratory Problems</h2>
<p>Azadirachta indica induces respiratory problems due to the presence of a compound called azadirachtin, which can cause inflammation and irritation in the lungs and airways. This can lead to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, especially in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Prolonged exposure to the plant or its extracts can exacerbate respiratory issues, making it essential to handle the plant with caution.</p>
