                    <h1>Mimosa callosa var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Mimosa callosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique, delicate foliage.</p>
