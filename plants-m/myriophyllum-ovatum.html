                    <h1>Myriophyllum ovatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum ovatum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Myriophyllum ovatum is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams, where it can form dense underwater stands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it both a valuable habitat for aquatic life and a potential invasive species in non-native waters.</p>
