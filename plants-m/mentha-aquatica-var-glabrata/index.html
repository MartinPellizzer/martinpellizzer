                            <h1>Mentha Aquatica Var. Glabrata</h1>
<p>Water mint, scientifically known as Mentha aquatica var. glabrata, is a hardy perennial herb native to wetland environments across Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and other water sources. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, heart-shaped leaves, and fragrant, peppermint-like aroma. While similar to common mint, it has a more subtle flavor and is less commonly used in culinary applications. Despite its limited use in cooking, water mint holds value in traditional medicine and ecological systems.</p>
