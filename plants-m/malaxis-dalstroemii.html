                    <h1>Malaxis dalstroemii</h1>
<p>Malaxis dalstroemii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Malaxis dalstroemii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
