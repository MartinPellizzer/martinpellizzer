                    <h1>Macrozamia conferta</h1>
<p>Macrozamia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen cycad native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark and a crown of stiff, dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically on separate plants. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland rainforest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
