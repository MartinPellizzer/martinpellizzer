                    <h1>Mascagnia coriacea</h1>
<p>Mascagnia coriacea, commonly known as the rough mascagnia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
<p>Mascagnia coriacea is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
