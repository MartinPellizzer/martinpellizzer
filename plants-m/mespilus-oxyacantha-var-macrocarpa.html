<p>Mespilus oxyacantha var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited blackthorn, is a variant of the blackthorn species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries that mature in late summer. These berries are edible but have a high acidity and are often used in culinary or medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
