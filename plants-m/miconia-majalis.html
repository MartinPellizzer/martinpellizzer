                    <h1>Miconia majalis</h1>
<p>Miconia majalis, commonly known as the silverleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, acidic taste. Miconia majalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
