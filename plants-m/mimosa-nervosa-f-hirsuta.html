<p>Mimosa nervosa f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage and unique leaf movements make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant.</p>
