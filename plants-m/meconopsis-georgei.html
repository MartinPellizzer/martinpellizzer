                    <h1>Meconopsis georgei</h1>
<p>Meconopsis georgei, commonly known as George's blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid blue or purple petals that resemble those of true poppies, though it belongs to the Fumariaceae family. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise stark alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Meconopsis georgei is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
