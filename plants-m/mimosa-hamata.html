                    <h1>Mimosa hamata</h1>
<p>Mimosa hamata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Mimosa hamata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique physiological response to stimuli.</p>
