<p>Melica rectiflora f. pilosa is a unique variant of the common melic grass known for its distinctive hairy foliage. This plant thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its feathery appearance and soft texture make it a striking addition to natural landscapes. While not widely cultivated, it holds ecological significance as a food source for various insects and small mammals. Its rare form highlights the diversity within the Melica genus and the beauty of plant variation.</p>
