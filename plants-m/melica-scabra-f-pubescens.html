                    <h1>Melica scabra f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Melica scabra f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates, it is valued in native plant landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
