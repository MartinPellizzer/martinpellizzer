<p>Medicago globulosa, commonly known as globular vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its globular, seed-like pods that give it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Medicago globulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
