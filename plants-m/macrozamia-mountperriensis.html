                    <h1>Macrozamia mountperriensis</h1>
<p>Macrozamia mountperriensis, commonly known as the Mount Perri cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
