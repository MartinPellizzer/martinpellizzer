<p>Maranta, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Marantaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their striking, often colorful foliage. Many species have leaves that fold shut at night, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help conserve moisture. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors that vary among species.</p>
<p>Maranta plants are popular as ornamental houseplants due to their aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
