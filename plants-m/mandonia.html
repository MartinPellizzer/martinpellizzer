                    <h1>Mandonia</h1>
<p>Mandonia, commonly known as the silverleaf mandonia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plants typically have silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Mandonia species are characterized by their daisy-like flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
