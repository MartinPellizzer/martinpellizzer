<p>Marsilea farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>farinosa, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into four to six lobes resembling a cloverleaf shape.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its spores are produced in small, round to oval structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to help control algae growth.</p>
