                    <h1>Mentha arvensis var. palatina</h1>
<p>Mentha arvensis var. palatina, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly methyl chavicol. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as other mint species, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
