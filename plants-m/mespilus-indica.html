                    <h1>Mespilus indica</h1>
<p>Mespilus indica, commonly known as the common medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are partially ripe, as they continue to soften and develop a sweet flavor after picking. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are pale green and appear in clusters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit.</p>
<p>The medlar is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
