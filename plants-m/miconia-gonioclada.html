<p>Miconia gonioclada, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. Miconia gonioclada is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of moist, shaded environments.</p>
