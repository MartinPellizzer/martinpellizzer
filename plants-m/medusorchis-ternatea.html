                    <h1>Medusorchis ternatea</h1>
<p>Medusorchis ternatea, commonly known as the three-lobed ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghost-like appearance, with three distinct lobes on its flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
