                    <h1>Medicago minima var. mollissima</h1>
<p>Medicago minima var. mollissima, commonly known as the silky medick, is a low-growing annual legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a useful plant for soil stabilization and as a component in ecological restoration projects.</p>
