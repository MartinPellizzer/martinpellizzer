                    <h1>Microchilus carauchanus</h1>
<p>Microchilus carauchanus, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight, though it can tolerate partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
