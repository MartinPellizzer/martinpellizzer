<p>Moullava welwitschiana, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stem and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The Welwitschia is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years.</p>
