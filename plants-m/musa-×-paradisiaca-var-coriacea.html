                    <h1>Musa × paradisiaca var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned banana, is a variant of the banana plant characterized by its thick, rugged leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The plant features a robust stem with a fibrous, woody texture that distinguishes it from other banana species. Its leaves are broad, dark green, and have a textured surface that gives it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers are clustered in a large inflorescence, typical of the Musa genus, and the plant is often grown in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
