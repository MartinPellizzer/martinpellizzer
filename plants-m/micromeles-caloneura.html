                    <h1>Micromeles caloneura</h1>
<p>Micromeles caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the families Euphorbiaceae and Rutaceae, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, and it produces a distinctive, sticky seed coating that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is often found in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems.</p>
