<p>Monadenium laeve f. depauperata, commonly known as the naked-stemmed monadenium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small and reduced, contributing to its overall compact and drought-resistant appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
