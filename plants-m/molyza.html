                    <h1>Molyza</h1>
<p>Molyza, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Molyza is native to the Americas but has been introduced to various parts of the world, where it can become invasive.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a significant agricultural weed.</p>
