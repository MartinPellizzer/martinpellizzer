<p>Mammillaria longiflora subsp.</p>
<p>tepexicensis, commonly known as the Tepexi milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are typically pale green to blue-gray, with distinct tubercles and areoles.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
