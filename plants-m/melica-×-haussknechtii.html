                    <h1>Melica × haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Melica × haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Melica nuda and Melica ciliata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between its parent species, contributing to the study of plant hybridization.</p>
