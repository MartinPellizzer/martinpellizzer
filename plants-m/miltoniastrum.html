<p>Miltoniastrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short, slender stem and lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the forest floor or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Miltoniastrum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
