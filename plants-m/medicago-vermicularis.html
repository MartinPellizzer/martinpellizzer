                    <h1>Medicago vermicularis</h1>
<p>Medicago vermicularis, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, elliptical pods containing several seeds. As a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and sustainable agriculture practices.</p>
