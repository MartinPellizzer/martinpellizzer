<p>Monadenus, commonly known as the "bottle plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are usually small and fleshy, further aiding in water conservation. Monadenus species are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>These plants produce small, yellow or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
