<p>Modecca saponaria, commonly known as soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its roots contain saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Modecca saponaria is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or hedgerow environments.</p>
