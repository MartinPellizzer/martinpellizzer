                    <h1>Monotropastrum humile</h1>
<p>Monotropastrum humile, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found growing on the roots of other trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
