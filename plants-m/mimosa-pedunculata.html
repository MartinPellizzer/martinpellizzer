<p>Mimosa pedunculata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa pedunculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings.</p>
