                    <h1>Malacocarpus tephracanthus var. depressus</h1>
<p>Malacocarpus tephracanthus var. depressus, commonly known as the lowland cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several conservation assessments.</p>
