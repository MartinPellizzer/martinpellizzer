<p>Miconia purpuriflora, commonly known as the purple-flowered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Miconia purpuriflora is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
