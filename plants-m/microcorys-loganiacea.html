<p>Microcorys loganiacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue or black berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
