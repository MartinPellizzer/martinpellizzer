<p>Monilaria ramulosa, commonly known as the ramose monilaria, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color and has a branched, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its growth and survival in various environments. It is often found on rocks and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to lichenologists and researchers studying symbiotic relationships.</p>
