<p>Monocarpia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal monocarp, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its reproductive strategy involves producing a single, large seed capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Monocarpia marginalis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
