<p>Manulea aridicola, commonly known as the desert manulea, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many species adapted to dry environments. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage.</p>
<p>Manulea aridicola is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water and care once established.</p>
