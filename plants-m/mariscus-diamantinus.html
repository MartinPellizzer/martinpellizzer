<p>Mariscus diamantinus, commonly known as the diamond dune grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mariscus diamantinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas.</p>
