                    <h1>Melia arguta</h1>
<p>Melia arguta, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Melia arguta is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used historically for various purposes.</p>
