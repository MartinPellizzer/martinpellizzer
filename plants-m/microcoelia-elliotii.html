<p>Microcoelia elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's microcoelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microcoelia elliotii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
