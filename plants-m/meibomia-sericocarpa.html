<p>Meibomia sericocarpa, commonly known as the silky-bark tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes flaky with age, and its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous small seeds. Meibomia sericocarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental bark and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
