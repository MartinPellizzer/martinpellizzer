<p>Micrargeria scopiformis, commonly known as the spiky burweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bristly, spiny fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a common weed in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in desert landscapes and along roadsides.</p>
