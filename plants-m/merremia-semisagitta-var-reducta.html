<p>Merremia semisagitta var. reducta, commonly known as the small-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, with a distinct reddish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the early morning. Its fibrous roots and vigorous growth habit make it a notable species in botanical gardens and ecological studies.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'reducta' is characterized by its reduced leaf size and altered floral morphology compared to the standard species.</p>
