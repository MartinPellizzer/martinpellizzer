                    <h1>Miconia nervosa</h1>
<p>Miconia nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia nervosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
