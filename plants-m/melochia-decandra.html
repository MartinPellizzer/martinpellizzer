<p>Melochia decandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging leaf, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
