                    <h1>Miconia spatellophora</h1>
<p>Miconia spatellophora, commonly known as the yellow miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Miconia spatellophora is a member of the Melastomataceae family, which includes many species with showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native habitat.</p>
