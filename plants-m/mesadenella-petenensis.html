<p>Mesadenella petenensis, commonly known as the Pet√©n liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and closely spaced. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Mesadenella petenensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
