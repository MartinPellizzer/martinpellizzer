                    <h1>Mystacinus arabicus</h1>
<p>Mystacinus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
