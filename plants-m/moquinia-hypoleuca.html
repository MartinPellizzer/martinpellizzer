<p>Moquinia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Moquinia hypoleuca is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it a resilient species in dynamic wetland habitats.</p>
