                    <h1>Maguireanthus ayangannae</h1>
<p>Maguireanthus ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannan Flamebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Ayanganna rainforest.</p>
<p>It features striking, vibrant orange-red petals that resemble flames, with a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant has a unique, branched stem structure and waxy, broad leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers bloom once a year, typically during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators like the Ayanganna hummingbird.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
