                    <h1>Medicago sativa f. salaverryensis</h1>
<p>Medicago sativa f. salaverryensis, commonly known as the Salaverry alfalfa, is a botanical variant of the common alfalfa plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct morphological features, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the standard variety. This form is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often cultivated for forage and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its genetic uniqueness makes it an important subject for botanical and agricultural research.</p>
