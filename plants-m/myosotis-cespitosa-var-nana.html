<p>Myosotis cespitosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions.</p>
