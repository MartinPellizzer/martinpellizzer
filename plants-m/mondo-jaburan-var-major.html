                    <h1>Mondo jaburan var. major</h1>
<p>Mondo jaburan var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf mondo grass, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that thrives in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with broad, dark green leaves that form a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>This variety is more robust than the standard mondo grass, making it suitable for a wider range of soil conditions.</p>
