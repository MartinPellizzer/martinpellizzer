<p>Mastigosciadium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, inconspicuous clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Mastigosciadium is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
