The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically a striking combination of white and pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
