                    <h1>Medica cretica</h1>
<p>Medica cretica, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Medica cretica plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its foliage for laying eggs.</p>
