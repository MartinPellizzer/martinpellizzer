                    <h1>Microsemma</h1>
<p>Microsemma, commonly known as the small-seeded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tiny, delicate seeds and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microsemma species often have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized growth habits, Microsemma plants are often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses.</p>
