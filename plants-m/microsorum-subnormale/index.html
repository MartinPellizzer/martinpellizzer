<p>Cork fern, scientifically known as Microsorum subnormale, is a unique and resilient fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and textured fronds that resemble the bark of cork trees, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening. With its elegant appearance and low maintenance requirements, the cork fern is a valuable addition to any plant collection.</p>
