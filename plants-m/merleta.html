                    <h1>Merleta</h1>
<p>Merleta, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that give it a ghostly appearance, especially in low light. The plant has a short growing season and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a rare trait among flowering plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
