                    <h1>Molinia caerulea var. humilis</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to violet flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or boggy conditions.</p>
