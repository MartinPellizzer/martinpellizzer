<p>Medusea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping medusa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Medusea procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
