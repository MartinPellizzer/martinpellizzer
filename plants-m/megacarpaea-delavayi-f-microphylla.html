                    <h1>Megacarpaea delavayi f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Megacarpaea delavayi f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed giant carpaea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high altitudes of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive, large, fleshy fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are smaller than those of the typical species, hence the subspecies name *microphylla*, meaning "small leaf.".</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
