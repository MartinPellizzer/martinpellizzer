                    <h1>Mimosa pudica var. hispida</h1>
<p>Mimosa pudica var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth-leaved Mimosa pudica. The plant features bipinnate leaves that fold inward when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and responsive behavior.</p>
