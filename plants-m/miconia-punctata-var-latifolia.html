<p>Miconia punctata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a waxy texture and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates, though it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
