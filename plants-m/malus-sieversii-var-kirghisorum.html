                    <h1>Malus sieversii var. kirghisorum</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii var. kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and is considered a progenitor of many cultivated apple varieties. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have serrated edges, while its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important role in both ecological systems and the genetic diversity of domesticated apples.</p>
