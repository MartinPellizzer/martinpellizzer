                    <h1>Medicago rigidula var. gerardi</h1>
<p>Medicago rigidula var. gerardi, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
