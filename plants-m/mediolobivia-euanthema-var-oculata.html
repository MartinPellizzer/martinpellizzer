<p>Mediolobivia euanthema var. oculata, commonly known as the Eye-Flower Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring prominent, eye-like markings on the petals and sepals. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
