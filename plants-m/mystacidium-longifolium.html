                    <h1>Mystacidium longifolium</h1>
<p>Mystacidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
