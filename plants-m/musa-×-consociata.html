                    <h1>Musa × consociata</h1>
<p>Musa × consociata, commonly known as the banana hybrid or banana cluster, is a naturally occurring hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, clustered growth habit and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces elongated, fleshy berries that are typically yellow when mature, though they are not usually consumed by humans. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of seedlings rather than fruit.</p>
<p>This species is also used in breeding programs to develop new banana varieties with improved traits.</p>
