<p>Microsorum brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a floating or submerged manner. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Microsorum brachylepis is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life.</p>
