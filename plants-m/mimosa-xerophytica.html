                    <h1>Mimosa xerophytica</h1>
<p>Mimosa xerophytica, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa xerophytica is well adapted to xeric conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
