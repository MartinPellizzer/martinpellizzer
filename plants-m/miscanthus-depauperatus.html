<p>Miscanthus depauperatus, commonly known as the silver grass or slender miscanthus, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
