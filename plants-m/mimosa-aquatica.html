                    <h1>Mimosa aquatica</h1>
<p>Mimosa aquatica, commonly known as water mimosa, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow in water or very moist soil. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with numerous small, feather-like leaflets that are sensitive to touch.</p>
<p>Mimosa aquatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
