                <h1>Macrothelypteris kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Macrothelypteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu hakea, is a fern native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and montane areas. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
