                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. tanaitica</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. tanaitica, commonly known as the Tanaisian goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
