                    <h1>Mystacidium dauphinense</h1>
<p>Mystacidium dauphinense, commonly known as the Dauphine's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of specific host trees, such as those in the genus Quercus. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential hosts. Its leaves are usually scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological interactions.</p>
