<p>Myoporum myoporoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf myoporum, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Myoporum myoporoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
