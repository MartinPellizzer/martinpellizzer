<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>strigulosa, commonly known as the bog Forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky pubescence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Myosotis genus, which are known for their delicate, flower-like appearance and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
