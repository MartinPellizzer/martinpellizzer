<p>Mertensia maritima, commonly known as sea bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Mertensia maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
