                    <h1>Medusea</h1>
<p>Medusea, commonly known as the sea nettle, is a type of cnidarian belonging to the class Scyphozoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and long, trailing tentacles that contain specialized stinging cells called nematocysts. These stinging cells are used to capture prey in marine environments. Medusea typically live in coastal waters and are often seen floating near the surface.</p>
<p>Their life cycle includes both a polyp stage and a medusa stage, which is the free-swimming adult form.</p>
