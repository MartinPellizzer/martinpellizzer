<p>Mesembryanthemum attenuatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments.</p>
