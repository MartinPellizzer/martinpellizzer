<p>Matucana chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden matucana, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, yellow-orange inflorescence that stands out against its dark green, strap-like leaves.

Its foliage is often adorned with small, white or green flowers that bloom sequentially along the central stem.</p>
<p>Matucana chrysacantha is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
