                    <h1>Melinis ambigua</h1>
<p>Melinis ambigua, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by three-lobed seed heads. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
