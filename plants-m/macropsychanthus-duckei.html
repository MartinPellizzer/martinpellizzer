                    <h1>Macropsychanthus duckei</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus duckei, commonly known as the duckei's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique floral structure with intricate, folded petals and a prominent, elongated lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
