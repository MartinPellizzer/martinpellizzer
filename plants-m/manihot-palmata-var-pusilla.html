                    <h1>Manihot palmata var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Manihot palmata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowleaf manioc, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before use.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its starchy roots, which can be used as a food source after proper preparation.</p>
