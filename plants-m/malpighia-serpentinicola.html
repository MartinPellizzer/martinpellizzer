                    <h1>Malpighia serpentinicola</h1>
<p>Malpighia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine beauty, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, particularly those rich in serpentine minerals, which influence its unique adaptations. It produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat and genetic adaptations to metal-rich environments.</p>
