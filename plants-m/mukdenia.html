                    <h1>Mukdenia</h1>
<p>Mukdenia, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to eastern Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Mukdenia species typically bloom in spring and are often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are not widely cultivated outside their native range.</p>
