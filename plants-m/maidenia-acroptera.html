                    <h1>Maidenia acroptera</h1>
<p>Maidenia acroptera, commonly known as the scarlet waxflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
