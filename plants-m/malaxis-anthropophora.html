<p>Malaxis anthropophora, commonly known as the human mimic orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, human-like appearance, with elongated, twisted sepals that resemble a face. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
