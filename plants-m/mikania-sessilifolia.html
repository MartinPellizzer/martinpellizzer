<p>Mikania sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are slender and twining. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to smother native vegetation.</p>
