<p>Miconia oldemanii, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, Miconia oldemanii is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
