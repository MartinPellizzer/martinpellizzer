<p>Melocactus peruvianus var. amstutziae, commonly known as the Amstutz's melon cactus, is a species native to the dry, rocky areas of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, covered in short, white spines. The plant produces a large, edible fruit that resembles a melon, which is typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is not only a food source for local wildlife but also has historical use by indigenous peoples for both sustenance and medicinal purposes.</p>
