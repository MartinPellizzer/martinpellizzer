<p>Mikania ternata, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the morning. Its heart-shaped leaves are usually opposite and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Mikania ternata is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
