<p>Mesembryanthemum salicola, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum salicola is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in sandy or coastal areas.</p>
