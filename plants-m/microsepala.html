                    <h1>Microsepala</h1>
<p>Microsepala, commonly known as the small-sepal orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers with small, specialized sepals. They are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Microsepala species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structures and growth habits make them of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
