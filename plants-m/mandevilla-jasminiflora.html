<p>Mandevilla jasminiflora, commonly known as the jasmine mandevilla, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and trailing or climbing habit, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble jasmine, hence its common name. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal blooming.</p>
<p>Mandevilla jasminiflora is relatively drought-tolerant once established but benefits from regular watering during dry periods.</p>
