<p>Miconia cephaloides, commonly known as the "false hibiscus," is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate native vegetation.</p>
