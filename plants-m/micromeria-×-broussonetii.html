                    <h1>Micromeria × broussonetii</h1>
<p>Micromeria × broussonetii, commonly known as the hybrid sand verbena, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Micromeria stricta and Broussonetia papyrifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, papery fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically.</p>
