                    <h1>Mezia beckii</h1>
<p>Mezia beckii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mezia beckii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
