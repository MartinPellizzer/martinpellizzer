                    <h1>Mentha arvensis var. radicans</h1>
<p>Mentha arvensis var. radicans, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, and it has aromatic, serrated leaves with a strong mint scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
