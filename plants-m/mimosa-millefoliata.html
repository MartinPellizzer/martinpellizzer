                    <h1>Mimosa millefoliata</h1>
<p>Mimosa millefoliata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
