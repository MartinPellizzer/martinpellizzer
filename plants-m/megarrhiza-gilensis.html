<p>Megarrhiza gilensis, commonly known as the Gil's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking, pale purple petals that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom during the late summer months, producing a delicate, ephemeral display that is difficult to observe in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Megarrhiza gilensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
