                    <h1>Metastelma trifurcatum</h1>
<p>Metastelma trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress on its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
