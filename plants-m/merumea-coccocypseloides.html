                    <h1>Merumea coccocypseloides</h1>
<p>Merumea coccocypseloides, commonly known as the red-bellied spider crab, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Coenocorinidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red coloration on the ventral side and a more subdued color on the dorsal side. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it inhabits rocky substrates and coral reefs. Its body structure is adapted for both crawling and swimming, with specialized appendages for grasping prey.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton often leads to confusion with certain algae or corals, though it is not a true plant.</p>
