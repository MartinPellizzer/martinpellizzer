<p>Masdevallia manta, commonly known as the Manta Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble the shape of a manta ray, hence its common name. The plant produces small, brightly colored flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Masdevallia manta requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and cool temperatures, to thrive.</p>
