                    <h1>Malaxis graciliscapa</h1>
<p>Malaxis graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>
