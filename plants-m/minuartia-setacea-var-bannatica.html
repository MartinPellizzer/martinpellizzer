<p>Minuartia setacea var. bannatica, commonly known as the Bannat's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features glabrous, blue-green foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
