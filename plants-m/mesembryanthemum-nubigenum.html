<p>Mesembryanthemum nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-spreading iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
