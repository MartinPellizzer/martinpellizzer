<p>Melandrium pratense var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in moist to moderately dry conditions.</p>
