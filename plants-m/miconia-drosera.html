                    <h1>Miconia drosera</h1>
<p>Miconia drosera, commonly known as the sticky miconia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain a sticky substance that can trap small insects, contributing to its role in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
