<p>Microsisymbrium griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's microsisymbrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
