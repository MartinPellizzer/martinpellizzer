                    <h1>Musa × sapientum var. rubra</h1>
<p>Musa × sapientum var. rubra, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its striking red peel.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid of *Musa acuminata* and *Musa balbisiana*, resulting in a unique genetic makeup. The fruit is typically smaller than common bananas and has a sweet, mild flavor. The red coloration of the peel is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in niche markets due to its distinctive appearance.</p>
