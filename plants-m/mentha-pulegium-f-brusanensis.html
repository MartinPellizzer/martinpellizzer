<p>Mentha pulegium f. brusanensis, commonly known as the Brusane pennyroyal, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the pennyroyal plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent and small, fragrant flowers. This subspecies is native to the Balkan region, particularly in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
