                    <h1>Medicago minima var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Medicago minima var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are typically hairy on both surfaces, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Hairy sainfoin is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in livestock forage.</p>
