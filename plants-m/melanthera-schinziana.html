<p>Melanthera schinziana, commonly known as the Schinz's melampyrum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often have a reddish or purple hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Melanthera schinziana is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
