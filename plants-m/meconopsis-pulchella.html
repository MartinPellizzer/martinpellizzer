                    <h1>Meconopsis pulchella</h1>
<p>Meconopsis pulchella, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet petals and dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, often in the shadow of glaciers or in shaded forested areas. Its flowers bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise stark alpine landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
