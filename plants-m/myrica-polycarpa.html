                    <h1>Myrica polycarpa</h1>
<p>Myrica polycarpa, commonly known as the bayberry or myrica, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy bark and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are highly aromatic and have been used historically for making candles and soap due to their high oil content.</p>
<p>Myrica polycarpa is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
