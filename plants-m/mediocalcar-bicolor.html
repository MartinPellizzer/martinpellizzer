                    <h1>Mediocalcar bicolor</h1>
<p>Mediocalcar bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, and its sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Mediocalcar bicolor is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, typically in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
