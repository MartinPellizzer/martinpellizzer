                    <h1>Mocquerysia epipetiola</h1>
<p>Mocquerysia epipetiola, commonly known as the Bornean cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
