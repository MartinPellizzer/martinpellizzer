<p>Monadenium rhizophorum var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the stoloniferous root grass, is a perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats through the production of horizontal stolons, which root at the nodes and establish new plants. The plant has small, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and tapering. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat creation.</p>
