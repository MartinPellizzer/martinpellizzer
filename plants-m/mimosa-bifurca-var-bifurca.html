                    <h1>Mimosa bifurca var. bifurca</h1>
<p>Mimosa bifurca var. bifurca, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to touch and its rapid growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
