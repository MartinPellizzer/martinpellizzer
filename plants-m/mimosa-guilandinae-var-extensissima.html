                    <h1>Mimosa guilandinae var. extensissima</h1>
<p>Mimosa guilandinae var. extensissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed mimosa, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and unique leaf movements.</p>
