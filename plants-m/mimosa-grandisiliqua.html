                    <h1>Mimosa grandisiliqua</h1>
<p>Mimosa grandisiliqua, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
