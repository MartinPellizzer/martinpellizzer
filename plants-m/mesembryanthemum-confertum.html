<p>Mesembryanthemum confertum, commonly known as the common ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
