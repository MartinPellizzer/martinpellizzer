                    <h1>Mimosa skinneri</h1>
<p>Mimosa skinneri, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mimosa skinneri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
