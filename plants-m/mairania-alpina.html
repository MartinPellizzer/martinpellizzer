                    <h1>Mairania alpina</h1>
<p>Mairania alpina, commonly known as the alpine mairania, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Mairania alpina is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
