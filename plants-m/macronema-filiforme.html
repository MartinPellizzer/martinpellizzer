<p>Macronema filiforme, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a small, delicate orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
