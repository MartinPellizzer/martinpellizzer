                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum pageae</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum pageae, commonly known as the Page's ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean and coastal climates.</p>
