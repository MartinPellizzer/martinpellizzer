<p>Mimosa strobiliflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters called corymbs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa strobiliflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and delicate blooms.</p>
