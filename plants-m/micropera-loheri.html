                    <h1>Micropera loheri</h1>
<p>Micropera loheri, commonly known as the Loher's micropera, is a rare and small flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, miniature flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its ecological role and reproductive biology.</p>
