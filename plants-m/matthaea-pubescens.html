<p>Matthaea pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent matthaea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Matthaea pubescens is often found in open habitats such as slopes and canyons, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
