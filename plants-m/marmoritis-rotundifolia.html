<p>Marmoritis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf marmoritis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>

The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Marmoritis rotundifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
