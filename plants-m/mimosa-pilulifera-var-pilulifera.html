<p>Mimosa pilulifera var. pilulifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are typically arranged in dense, globular clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to self-seed, making it both popular and sometimes invasive in certain regions.</p>
