                    <h1>Mascagnia sepium var. typica</h1>
<p>Mascagnia sepium var. typica, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible but contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique ecological role, it is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
