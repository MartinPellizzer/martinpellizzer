<p>Chinese mallow, scientifically known as Malva parnassiifolia, is a flowering plant native to East Asia, particularly China.

Often grown for its ornamental value, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its delicate appearance and cultural significance make it a popular subject in both horticulture and herbal practices.</p>
