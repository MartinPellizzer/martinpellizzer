<p>Medicago lupulina subsp.</p>
<p>eurasiatica, commonly known as the Eurasian sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers in racemes. Its seeds are small and encased in a hairy pod, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>As a nitrogen-fixing plant, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
