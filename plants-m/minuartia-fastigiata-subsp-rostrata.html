<p>Minuartia fastigiata subsp.</p>
<p>rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, rostrate (beak-like) stigma, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
