<p>Mahonia oiwakensis, commonly known as the Oiwaken mahonia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
