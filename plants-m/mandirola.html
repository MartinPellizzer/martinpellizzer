<p>Mandirola, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Mandirola is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
