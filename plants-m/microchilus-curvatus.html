<p>Microchilus curvatus, commonly known as the curved-lobed orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in the dappled light of the understory. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive curved lip. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
