<p>Maxillaria santanae, commonly known as the Santana's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the humid cloud forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a short, horizontal rhizome and produces compact, pseudobulb-like structures. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It blooms during the dry season, which is unusual for many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
