<p>Mastersiella diffusa, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
