                    <h1>Magnolia montebelloensis</h1>
<p>Magnolia montebelloensis, commonly known as the Montebello magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Montebello in the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
