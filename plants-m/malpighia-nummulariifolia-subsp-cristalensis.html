<p>Malpighia nummulariifolia subsp.</p>
<p>cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystal Apple, is a shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its small, round, bright red berries that resemble tiny apples, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
