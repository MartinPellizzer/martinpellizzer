<p>Mikania williamsii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats over other vegetation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
