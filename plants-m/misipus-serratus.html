<p>Misipus serratus, commonly known as the serrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its root system forms haustoria that penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Misipus serratus is native to regions of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
