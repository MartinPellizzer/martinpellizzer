                    <h1>Melasma</h1>
<p>Melasma, commonly known as the "mask of shame," is a skin condition characterized by the appearance of dark, irregular patches on the face.</p>
<p>It is primarily caused by an overproduction of melanin, which is the pigment responsible for skin color. Botanically, it is not a plant but a dermatological condition, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, some plants contain compounds that may help in treating or preventing melasma by inhibiting melanin production.</p>
<p>These include ingredients like licorice root, green tea, and certain citrus fruits.</p>
