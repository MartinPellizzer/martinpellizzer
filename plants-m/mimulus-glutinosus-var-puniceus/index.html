<p>Mimulus glutinosus var. puniceus is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant known for its vibrant red blooms. This variety of the common monkeyflower thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive spur, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Native to the western United States, it is often found in stream banks and moist meadows. Despite its ornamental appeal, it also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
