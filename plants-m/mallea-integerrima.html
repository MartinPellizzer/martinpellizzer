                    <h1>Mallea integerrima</h1>
<p>Mallea integerrima, commonly known as the rigid mallea, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, woody structure.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it has adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in drought resistance. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Mallea integerrima plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
