<p>Malacothamnus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Malacothamnus densiflorus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
