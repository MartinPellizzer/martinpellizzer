                    <h1>Mertensia lanceolata var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Mertensia lanceolata var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name "coriacea," which means "coriaceous" or leathery. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It typically grows in moist, woodsy areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
