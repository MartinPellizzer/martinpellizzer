                    <h1>Miconia chartacea</h1>
<p>Miconia chartacea, commonly known as the paperleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, giving it a distinctive, almost papery texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
