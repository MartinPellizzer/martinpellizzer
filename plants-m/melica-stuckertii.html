<p>Melica stuckertii, commonly known as Stuckert's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Melica stuckertii is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
