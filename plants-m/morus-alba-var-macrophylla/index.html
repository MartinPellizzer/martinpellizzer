                            <h1>Morus Alba Var. Macrophylla</h1>
<p>Morus alba var. macrophylla is a unique variant of the white mulberry tree known for its large, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to parts of Asia and has been cultivated for centuries for its edible fruits and fibrous bark. Its broad leaves make it a striking addition to gardens and landscapes. The tree is also valued for its role in silk production and as a food source for silkworms. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires proper care to thrive in various climates.</p>
