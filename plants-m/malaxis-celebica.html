                    <h1>Malaxis celebica</h1>
<p>Malaxis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes Malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and neighboring regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it produces a single, elongated spike bearing multiple blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis celebica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
