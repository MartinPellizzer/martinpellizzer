<p>Microlepia matthewii, commonly known as the Matthew's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizome is wiry and covered in fine roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
