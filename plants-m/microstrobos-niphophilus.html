                    <h1>Microstrobos niphophilus</h1>
<p>Microstrobos niphophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving pine, is a rare coniferous species native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
