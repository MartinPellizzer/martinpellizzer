                    <h1>Mohavea</h1>
<p>Mohavea, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape, formed by tightly packed, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Mohavea species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in desert habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
