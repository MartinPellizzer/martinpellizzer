<p>Mollugo spergula, commonly known as bladder campion, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Mollugo spergula is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
