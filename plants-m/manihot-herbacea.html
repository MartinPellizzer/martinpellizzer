                    <h1>Manihot herbacea</h1>
<p>Manihot herbacea, commonly known as wild cassava, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its roots, though not as economically important as those of Manihot esculenta, are occasionally used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
