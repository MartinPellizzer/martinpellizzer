                    <h1>Microgramma piloselloides</h1>
<p>Microgramma piloselloides, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
