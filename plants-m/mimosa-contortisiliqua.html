                    <h1>Mimosa contortisiliqua</h1>
<p>Mimosa contortisiliqua, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, Mimosa contortisiliqua is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
