                    <h1>Myrica pumila</h1>
<p>Myrica pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some birds.</p>
<p>Myrica pumila is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
