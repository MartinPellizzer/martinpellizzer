                    <h1>Myanthe</h1>
<p>Myanthe, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Myanthe species produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of true dandelions.</p>
<p>These plants are often considered weeds but can be found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils.</p>
