<p>Mesembryanthemum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
