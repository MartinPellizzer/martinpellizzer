<p>Myrmecodia brassii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow, chamber-like structure. The plant hosts ants in these chambers, which provide protection and nutrients in exchange for shelter. Its leaves are small,革质 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia brassii is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance and interesting symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
