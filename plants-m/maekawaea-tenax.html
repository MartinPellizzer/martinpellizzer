                    <h1>Maekawaea tenax</h1>
<p>Maekawaea tenax, commonly known as the Maekawa grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and forest clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Maekawaea tenax is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
