                    <h1>Microstylis unifolia</h1>
<p>Microstylis unifolia, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to its wetland environment, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish dense stands.</p>
<p>Microstylis unifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
