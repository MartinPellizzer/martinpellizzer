                    <h1>Macrozamia denisonii</h1>
<p>Macrozamia denisonii, commonly known as the Denison's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly large and distinctive. Macrozamia denisonii is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of its native ecosystem.</p>
