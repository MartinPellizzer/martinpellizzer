<p>Miconia licrophora, commonly known as the water miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. These berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
