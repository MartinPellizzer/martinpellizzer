                            <h1>Malva Verticillata Subsp. Pulchella</h1>
<p>Malva verticillata subsp. pulchella is a striking member of the Malvaceae family known for its vibrant pink to purple flowers. This perennial plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its heart-shaped leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental value. The subspecies is particularly noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in changing environmental conditions.</p>
