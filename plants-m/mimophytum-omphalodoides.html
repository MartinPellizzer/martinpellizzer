<p>Mimophytum omphalodoides, commonly known as the desert star or false dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Mimophytum omphalodoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
