                <h1>Medicago sulcata</h1>
<p>Medicago sulcata, commonly known as the crested medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive central leaflet that often has a wavy or serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to dry and poor soils, making it a valuable forage crop in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its roots enhances soil fertility.</p>
