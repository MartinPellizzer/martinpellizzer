                    <h1>Multidentia crassa</h1>
<p>Multidentia crassa, commonly known as the broad-toothed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its robust and often sprawling growth habit.</p>
<p>It features large, compound fronds with multiple, broad, tooth-like lobes that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
