<p>Microschizaea robusta, commonly known as the robust liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. This species typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Microschizaea robusta has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense, and it reproduces via spores.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its often harsh and humid habitat.</p>
