                    <h1>Mariscus seemannianus</h1>
<p>Mariscus seemannianus, commonly known as the Seemann's mariscus, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in complex, branched umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus seemannianus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
