<p>Myriopteris notholaenoides, commonly known as the western rock cap fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It is native to the western United States and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche.</p>
