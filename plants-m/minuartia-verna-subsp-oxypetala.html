<p>The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, known for its characteristic cross-shaped flowers and specialized seed pods.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to grow.</p>
