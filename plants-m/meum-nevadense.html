                    <h1>Meum nevadense</h1>
<p>Meum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada meadowfoam, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Meum nevadense is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with full sun exposure.</p>
