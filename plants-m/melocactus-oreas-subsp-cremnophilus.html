<p>Melocactus oreas subsp.</p>
<p>cremnophilus, commonly known as the rock melon cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
