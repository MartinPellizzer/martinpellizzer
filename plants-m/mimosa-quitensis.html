                    <h1>Mimosa quitensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa quitensis, commonly known as the Andean mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptive features, it is of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
