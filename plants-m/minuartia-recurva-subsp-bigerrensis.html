<p>Minuartia recurva subsp.</p>
<p>bigerrensis, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
