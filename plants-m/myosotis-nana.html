<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that rarely exceed 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue or violet flowers, typically with five petals, during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve heat in cold environments.</p>
