<p>Maerua juncea subsp.</p>
<p>crustata, commonly known as the stone veld or desert thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
