                    <h1>Meristostigma heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Meristostigma heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable meristostigma, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant exhibits heterophyllous leaves, meaning its leaves vary in shape and size depending on their position on the plant. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have five petals, with a unique arrangement of stamens and pistils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Meristostigma heterophyllum is considered a botanically significant but poorly understood species.</p>
