<p>Micrantheum inversum, commonly known as the inverted micrantheum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique floral structure features upward-facing petals that contrast with its downward-facing sepals, creating an unusual visual appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
