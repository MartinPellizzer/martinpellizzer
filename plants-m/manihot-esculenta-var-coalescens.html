                    <h1>Manihot esculenta var. coalescens</h1>
<p>Manihot esculenta var. coalescens, commonly known as the African manioc or bitter manioc, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its starchy, tuberous roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain cyanogenic glycosides, requiring processing to remove toxic compounds. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for both its roots and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important staple food in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
