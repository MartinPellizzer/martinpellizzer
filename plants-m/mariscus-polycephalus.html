                    <h1>Mariscus polycephalus</h1>
<p>Mariscus polycephalus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. These bladders are typically transparent and can be found in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Mariscus polycephalus is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
