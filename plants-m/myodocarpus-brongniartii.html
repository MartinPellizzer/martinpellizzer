<p>Myodocarpus brongniartii, commonly known as the African white wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical drupes. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a milky sap when wounded.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, though it is not widely used commercially due to its limited distribution.</p>
