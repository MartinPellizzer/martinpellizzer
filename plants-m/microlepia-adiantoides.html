<p>Microlepia adiantoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
