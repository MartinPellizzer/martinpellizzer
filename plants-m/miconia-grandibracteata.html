                    <h1>Miconia grandibracteata</h1>
<p>Miconia grandibracteata, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments.</p>
