<p>Micromeria teneriffae f. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy micromeria, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and densely hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is noted for its aromatic properties.</p>
