                    <h1>Macroptilium lathyroides</h1>
<p>Macroptilium lathyroides, commonly known as the hairy peanut or wild peanut, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to true peanuts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
