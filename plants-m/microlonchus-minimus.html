                    <h1>Microlonchus minimus</h1>
<p>Microlonchus minimus, commonly known as the small leaved burrweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, narrow leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain water in dry environments.</p>
<p>Microlonchus minimus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
