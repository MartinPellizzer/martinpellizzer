<p>Melica festucoides, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
