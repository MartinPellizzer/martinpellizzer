                    <h1>Mimosa hypnodes</h1>
<p>Mimosa hypnodes, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa hypnodes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and delicate appearance.</p>
