                            <h1>Mitracarpus Diffusus</h1>
<p>Mexican oregano, scientifically known as Mitracarpus diffusus, is a unique and aromatic herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. This plant is prized for its strong, pungent flavor and its use in traditional Mexican cuisine and herbal remedies. Despite its name, it is not related to the common oregano used in Mediterranean cooking, but rather belongs to the nightshade family. Its leaves and flowers are often used to enhance the taste of dishes and for their medicinal properties. With its distinct appearance and versatile applications, Mexican oregano remains a valued plant in both culinary and herbal traditions.</p>
