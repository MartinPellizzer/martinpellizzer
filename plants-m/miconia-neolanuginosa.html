                    <h1>Miconia neolanuginosa</h1>
<p>Miconia neolanuginosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it is introduced.</p>
