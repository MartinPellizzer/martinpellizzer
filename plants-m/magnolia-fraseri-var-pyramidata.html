<p>Magnolia fraseri var. pyramidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, with a pyramidal or columnar shape that makes it ideal for small spaces. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for urban environments due to its tolerance of compacted soils and partial shade.</p>
