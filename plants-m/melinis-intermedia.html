                    <h1>Melinis intermedia</h1>
<p>Melinis intermedia, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Buffelgrass is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and high seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
