                    <h1>Micromeles burtonsmithiorum</h1>
<p>Micromeles burtonsmithiorum, commonly known as the Burtonsmith's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that attach to its host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
