<p>Malus sieversii subsp.</p>
<p>hissarica, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild apple species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and is considered a genetic ancestor of many cultivated apple varieties.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and has a compact, shrub-like form. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces white flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding improved apple cultivars.</p>
