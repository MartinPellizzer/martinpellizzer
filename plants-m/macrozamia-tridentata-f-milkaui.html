                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata f. milkaui</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata f. milkaui, commonly known as the Milkaui cycad, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, segmented trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to the arid regions of Queensland, Australia, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones, which are typically yellowish-green, contain the plant's seeds, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
