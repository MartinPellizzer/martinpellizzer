<p>Masdevallia regina, commonly known as the Queen Masdevallia, is a striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence that bears clusters of intricate, butterfly-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Masdevallia regina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegance and the diversity of its floral display.</p>
