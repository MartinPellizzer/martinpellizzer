                    <h1>Melica ciliata f. glabrata</h1>
<p>Melica ciliata f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous soft brome, is a variant of the soft brome species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a grass with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration projects.</p>
