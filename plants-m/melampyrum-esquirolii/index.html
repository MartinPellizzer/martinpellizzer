<p>Red bartsia, scientifically known as Melampyrum esquirolii, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the western United States. It is often found in open woodlands and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant is named for its vibrant red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat. Despite its beauty, Red bartsia remains relatively obscure to the general public.</p>
