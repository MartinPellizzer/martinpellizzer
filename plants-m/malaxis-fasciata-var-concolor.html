<p>Malaxis fasciata var. concolor, commonly known as the plain-streaked malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a raceme, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
