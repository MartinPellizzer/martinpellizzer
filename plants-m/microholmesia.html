                    <h1>Microholmesia</h1>
<p>Microholmesia, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and pinnately compound leaves. They produce cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of cycads. Microholmesia species are typically slow-growing and have a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction.</p>
