<p>Mesembryanthemum cognatum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum cognatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
