<p>Moquiniastrum discolor, commonly known as the pink marshmallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has soft, hairy leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped, and it thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils.</p>
<p>Moquiniastrum discolor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
