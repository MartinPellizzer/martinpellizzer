<p>Micromeria cremnophila, commonly known as the crevice micromeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and coastal bluffs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Micromeria cremnophila is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
