<p>Manihot esculenta var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow cassava, is a variant of the cassava plant native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flesh, which is distinct from the more common white-fleshed cassava varieties. The plant is an herbaceous perennial shrub that produces edible tuberous roots, which are rich in carbohydrates but contain toxic cyanogenic glycosides that must be properly processed before consumption. The leaves are also edible and can be used in various culinary preparations.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique color and nutritional profile, making it an important crop in certain agricultural systems.</p>
