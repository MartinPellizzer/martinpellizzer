<p>Memorialis neilgherrensis var. trialata, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its white to pale pink petals and robust, hairy stems. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, with a woolly texture that helps insulate against the harsh mountain climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
