<p>Marcetia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Marcetia bahiensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
