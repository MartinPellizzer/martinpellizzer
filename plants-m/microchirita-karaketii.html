<p>Microchirita karaketii, commonly known as the Karaketii starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microchirita karaketii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
