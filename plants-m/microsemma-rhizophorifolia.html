                    <h1>Microsemma rhizophorifolia</h1>
<p>Microsemma rhizophorifolia, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a rare and specialized plant found in coastal mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic fern that attaches itself to the roots of mangrove trees, such as Rhizophora species, using its rhizomes. The plant has small, delicate fronds that are adapted to tolerate saline conditions and periodic flooding. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Microsemma rhizophorifolia plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in mangrove habitats.</p>
