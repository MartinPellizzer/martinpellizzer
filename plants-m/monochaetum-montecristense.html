                    <h1>Monochaetum montecristense</h1>
<p>Monochaetum montecristense, commonly known as the Montecristo spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Montecristo in the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces long, narrow spikelets that are often adorned with a single bristle at the tip. The plant thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of its island home. It plays a role in stabilizing the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its endemic status.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to the harsh environmental conditions of the Galápagos.</p>
