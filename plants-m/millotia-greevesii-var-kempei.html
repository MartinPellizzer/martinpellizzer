                    <h1>Millotia greevesii var. kempei</h1>
<p>Millotia greevesii var. kempei, commonly known as the Kempe's millotia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with five petals arranged symmetrically. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This variant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
