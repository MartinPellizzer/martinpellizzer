<p>Microlicia viminalis, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Eucalyptus genus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Microlicia viminalis is found in various parts of Australia and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
