                    <h1>Melampyrum australe f. edentatum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum australe f. edentatum, commonly known as the Australian cowplant, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The subspecies edentatum is distinguished by its lack of teeth on the leaf margins, a feature that sets it apart from other forms of Melampyrum. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with reduced leaves and specialized root systems for nutrient absorption.</p>
