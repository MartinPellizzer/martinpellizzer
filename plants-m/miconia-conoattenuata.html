                    <h1>Miconia conoattenuata</h1>
<p>Miconia conoattenuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers.</p>
