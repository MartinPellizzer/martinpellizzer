<p>Modestia pteroclada, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and unique, often fragrant blooms that resemble orchids in structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Modestia pteroclada is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
