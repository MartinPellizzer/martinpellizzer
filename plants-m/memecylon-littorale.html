<p>Memecylon littorale, commonly known as the coastal memecylon, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along tidal zones, showcasing its adaptability to saline and waterlogged conditions. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its coastal habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
