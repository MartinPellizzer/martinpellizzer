                    <h1>Macaranga auriculata</h1>
<p>Macaranga auriculata, commonly known as the ear-leaved macaranga, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and agricultural areas due to its rapid growth rate. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in sunny environments.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, making it an important plant in ecological studies.</p>
