                            <h1>Mesua Macrantha</h1>
<p>Mesua macrantha, known as the flame of the forest, is a striking tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. Its most notable feature is its vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a fiery display during the dry season. This tree is valued not only for its beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Despite its ornamental appeal, Mesua macrantha faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
