                    <h1>Moraea edulis var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Moraea edulis var. longifolia, commonly known as the sweet cycad, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and striking, showy inflorescences that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that while it is not toxic, it may have some medicinal uses in traditional African practices.</p>
