<p>Masdevallia brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed masdevallia, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Masdevallia brevis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
