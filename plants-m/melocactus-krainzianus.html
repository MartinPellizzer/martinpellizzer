                    <h1>Melocactus krainzianus</h1>
<p>Melocactus krainzianus, commonly known as the Krainzian melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, globose stem and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces a single, large, yellow or orange flower that blooms at the top of the stem during the warmer months. Its flowers are typically followed by a fruit that turns red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>
