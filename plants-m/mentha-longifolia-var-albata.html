                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. albata</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. albata, commonly known as white mint, is a variant of the spearmint plant characterized by its pale, almost white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces aromatic leaves with a minty scent, though its flavor is generally milder than that of typical spearmint. It is commonly used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for its refreshing properties.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
