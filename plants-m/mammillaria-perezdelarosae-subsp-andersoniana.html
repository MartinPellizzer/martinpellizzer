<p>Mammillaria perezdelarosae subsp.</p>
<p>andersoniana, commonly known as the Anderson's nipple cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with prominent areoles and short, white spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
