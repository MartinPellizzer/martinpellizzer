                    <h1>Mimosa filicioides</h1>
<p>Mimosa filicioides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with numerous pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa filicioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
