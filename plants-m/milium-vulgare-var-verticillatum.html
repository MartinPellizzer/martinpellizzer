<p>Milium vulgare var. verticillatum, commonly known as basket grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Basket grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
