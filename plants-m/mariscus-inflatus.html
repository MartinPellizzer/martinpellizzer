                    <h1>Mariscus inflatus</h1>
<p>Mariscus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its morphology includes small, leafless stems with specialized bladders that function as traps for prey.</p>
<p>Mariscus inflatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
