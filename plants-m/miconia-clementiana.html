<p>Miconia clementiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
