                    <h1>Melasma barbatum</h1>
<p>Melasma barbatum, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a leathery, greenish-black upper surface and a lighter, powdery lower surface. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutrient acquisition. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
