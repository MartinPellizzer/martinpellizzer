                    <h1>Mesophlebion dulitense</h1>
<p>Mesophlebion dulitense, commonly known as the Dullit Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Dulit in the Bismarck Archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mesophlebion dulitense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
