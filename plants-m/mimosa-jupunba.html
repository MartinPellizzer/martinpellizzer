<p>Mimosa jupunba, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Mimosa jupunba is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
