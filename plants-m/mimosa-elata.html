<p>Mimosa elata, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a small shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa elata is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait that contributes to its common name.</p>
