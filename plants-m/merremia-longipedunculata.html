<p>Merremia longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stalked morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
