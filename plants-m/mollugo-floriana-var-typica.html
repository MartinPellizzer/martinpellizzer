<p>Mollugo floriana var. typica, commonly known as the common carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a carpet-like growth. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
