                    <h1>Mikania hoffmanniana var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Mikania hoffmanniana var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard variety, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
