<p>Mammillaria polythele var. latimamma, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a ribbed stem covered in white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which open at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
