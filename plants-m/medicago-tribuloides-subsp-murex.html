<p>Medicago tribuloides subsp.</p>
<p>murex, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
