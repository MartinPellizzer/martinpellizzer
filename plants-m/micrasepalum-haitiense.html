<p>Micrasepalum haitiense, commonly known as the Haitian grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly Haiti.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Micrasepalum haitiense is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in open areas such as forests or grasslands.</p>
