                    <h1>Mimosa comosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa comosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual native to South America.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnately compound leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
