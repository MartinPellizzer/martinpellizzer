<p>Minuartia verna subsp.</p>
<p>hercynica, commonly known as the spring rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky substrates.</p>
