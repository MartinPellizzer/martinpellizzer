                    <h1>Malaxis balabacensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis balabacensis, commonly known as the Balabac ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
