<p>Melocactus grisoleoviridis, commonly known as the green-spined melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered with long, green spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus grisoleoviridis is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
