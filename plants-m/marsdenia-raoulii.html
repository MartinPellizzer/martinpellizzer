                    <h1>Marsdenia raoulii</h1>
<p>Marsdenia raoulii, commonly known as the Raouli's Marsdenia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest understories where it uses its tendrils to climb towards light.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its vigorous growth.</p>
