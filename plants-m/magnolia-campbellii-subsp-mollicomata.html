<p>Magnolia campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>mollicomata, commonly known as the Campbell's magnolia, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear.</p>
