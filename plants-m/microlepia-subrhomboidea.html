<p>Microlepia subrhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid microlepia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
