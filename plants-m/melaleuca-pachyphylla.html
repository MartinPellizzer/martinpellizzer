<p>Melaleuca pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels off in strips, revealing a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red or yellow, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca pachyphylla is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
