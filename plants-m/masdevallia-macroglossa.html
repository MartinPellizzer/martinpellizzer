<p>Masdevallia macroglossa, commonly known as the giant lip orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>The orchid blooms in the spring, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
