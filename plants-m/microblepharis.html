                    <h1>Microblepharis</h1>
<p>Microblepharis, commonly known as the small-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, narrow leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are often inconspicuous, typical of many grasses. Microblepharis species are usually found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they have adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>These plants play a minor but important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
