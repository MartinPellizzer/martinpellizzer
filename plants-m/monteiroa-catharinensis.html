<p>Monteiroa catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
