<p>Mascagnia sepium var. pubens, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae).</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a fuzzy appearance and helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
