<p>Melocactus oreas subsp.</p>
<p>ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, prominent spination at the top of the stem, which is a distinguishing feature. It blooms with yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
