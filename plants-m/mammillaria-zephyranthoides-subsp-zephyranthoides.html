<p>Mammillaria zephyranthoides subsp.</p>
<p>zephyranthoides, commonly known as the Zephyranthus mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale yellow tubercles, each bearing a single, erect spine.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
