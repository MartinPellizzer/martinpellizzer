                    <h1>Mikania scandens var. minima</h1>
<p>Mikania scandens var. minima, commonly known as the smallleaf mile-a-minute vine, is a fast-growing, climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
