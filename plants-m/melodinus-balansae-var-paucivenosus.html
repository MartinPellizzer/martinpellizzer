<p>Melodinus balansae var. paucivenosus, commonly known as the slender-veined melodinus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves with sparse and fine venation, which distinguish it from other varieties of Melodinus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale yellow, and are accompanied by a distinctive, fleshy calyx.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
