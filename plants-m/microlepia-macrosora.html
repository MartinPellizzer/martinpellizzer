<p>Microlepia macrosora, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping stem that supports its extensive foliage.
