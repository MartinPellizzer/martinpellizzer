<p>Mikania serratifolia, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
