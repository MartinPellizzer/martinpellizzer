                    <h1>Mimosa prionopus</h1>
<p>Mimosa prionopus, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Mimosa prionopus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and delicate appearance.</p>
