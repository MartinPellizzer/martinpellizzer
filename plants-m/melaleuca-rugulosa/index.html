                            <h1>Melaleuca Rugulosa</h1>
<p>Melaleuca rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. This plant is characterized by its thick, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of light and dark green beneath. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating that gives them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting a variety of native pollinators. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, Melaleuca rugulosa is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant and low-maintenance plants.</p>
