                    <h1>Melanoselinum insulare</h1>
<p>Melanoselinum insulare, commonly known as the island darkselinum, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain remote islands.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and humid, coastal environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island biogeography.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this fragile species from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
