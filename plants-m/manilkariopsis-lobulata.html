<p>Manilkariopsis lobulata, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>

The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
