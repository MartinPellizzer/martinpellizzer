<p>Muhlenbergia densiflora, commonly known as silver muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens and landscapes.</p>
