                    <h1>Melocactus heimenii</h1>
<p>Melocactus heimenii, commonly known as the Heimâ€™s melon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
