                    <h1>Mouretia larsenii</h1>
<p>Mouretia larsenii, commonly known as the Larsen's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited geographic distribution, Mouretia larsenii is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
