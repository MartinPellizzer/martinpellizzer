                    <h1>Mallostoma caracasanum</h1>
<p>Mallostoma caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasanum bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mallostoma caracasanum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
