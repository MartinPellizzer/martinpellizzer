                    <h1>Microsorum latilobatum</h1>
<p>Microsorum latilobatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, and prefers shaded, moist conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microsorum latilobatum is often used in aquatic horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality.</p>
