<p>Manfreda pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's manfreda, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Manfreda pringlei is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
