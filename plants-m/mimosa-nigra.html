                    <h1>Mimosa nigra</h1>
<p>Mimosa nigra, commonly known as the black mimosa, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark, leathery pods containing seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often appearing dark brown to black, which gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa nigra is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
