                    <h1>Malus sylvestris var. apetala</h1>
<p>Malus sylvestris var. apetala, commonly known as the apple tree with no petals, is a rare variant of the common apple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of showy petals, which is unusual in the genus Malus. The plant typically produces small, apple-like fruits that are edible but often less flavorful than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and genetic traits.</p>
