                    <h1>Mimosa subenervis</h1>
<p>Mimosa subenervis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings.</p>
