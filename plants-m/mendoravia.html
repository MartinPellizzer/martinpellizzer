                    <h1>Mendoravia</h1>
<p>Mendoravia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and clustered flowers that resemble small bells.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Mendoravia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
