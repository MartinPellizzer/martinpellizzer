<p>Mentha viridis var. sinuosa, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated or sinuous margin, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stem, typically in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
