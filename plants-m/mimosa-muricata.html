                    <h1>Mimosa muricata</h1>
<p>Mimosa muricata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its stems are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa muricata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
