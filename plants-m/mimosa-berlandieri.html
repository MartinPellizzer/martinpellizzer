<p>Mimosa berlandieri, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptations to drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
