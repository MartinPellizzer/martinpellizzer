                    <h1>Miconia neocrugeriana</h1>
<p>Miconia neocrugeriana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-colored berry that contains numerous small, edible seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native habitat.</p>
