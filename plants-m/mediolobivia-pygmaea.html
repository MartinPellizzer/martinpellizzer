                    <h1>Mediolobivia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Mediolobivia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers open only during the evening, closing by dawn, which is a unique adaptation to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Mediolobivia pygmaea is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal.</p>
