                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum induratum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum induratum, commonly known as the hard-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum induratum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
