<p>Malva occidentalis, commonly known as the western mallows, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and hairy leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration.</p>
