                    <h1>Medicago orbicularis var. castellana</h1>
<p>Medicago orbicularis var. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its seeds are encased in a spiny burr, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its potential for forage in arid environments.</p>
