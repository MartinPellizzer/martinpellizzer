                    <h1>Mesosetum annuum</h1>
<p>Mesosetum annuum, commonly known as the annual buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Mesosetum annuum is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
