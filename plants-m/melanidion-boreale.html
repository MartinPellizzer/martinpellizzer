                    <h1>Melanidion boreale</h1>
<p>Melanidion boreale, commonly known as the northern melanidion, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Melanidion boreale plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems.</p>
