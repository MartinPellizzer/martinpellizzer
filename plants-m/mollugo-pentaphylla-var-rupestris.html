                    <h1>Mollugo pentaphylla var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Mollugo pentaphylla var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock moss or rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish-brown seed capsules. It is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
