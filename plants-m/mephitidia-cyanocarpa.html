<p>Mephitidia cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited mistplant, is a rare species native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue berries, which are encased in a waxy, translucent skin. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, woody stem. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
