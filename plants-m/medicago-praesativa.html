                    <h1>Medicago praesativa</h1>
<p>Medicago praesativa, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose spikes. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in soil fixation due to its ability to form nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Medicago praesativa is also valued in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
