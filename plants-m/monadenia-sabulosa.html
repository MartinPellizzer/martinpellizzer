                    <h1>Monadenia sabulosa</h1>
<p>Monadenia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand dune daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is well adapted to sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Monadenia sabulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
