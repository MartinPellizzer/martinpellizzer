                    <h1>Medicago radiata var. dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Medicago radiata var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces hairy, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a forage crop.</p>
