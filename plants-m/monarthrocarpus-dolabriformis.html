<p>Monarthrocarpus dolabriformis, commonly known as the sickle-shaped liverwort, is a species of leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sickle-shaped thallus that is often flattened and covered with small, rounded lobes.

Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>This liverwort is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
