                    <h1>Melinis merkeri</h1>
<p>Melinis merkeri, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its rapid spread. Buffelgrass is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation and increase the risk of wildfires.</p>
