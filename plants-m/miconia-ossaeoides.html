                    <h1>Miconia ossaeoides</h1>
<p>Miconia ossaeoides, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive and striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Miconia ossaeoides is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments.</p>
