<p>Macrodiervilla middendorffiana, commonly known as the Russian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant has slender, arching branches and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and unique fruiting display.</p>
