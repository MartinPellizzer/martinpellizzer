<p>Microlepia pilosella, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a slender, arching form that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
