                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum graniforme</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum graniforme, commonly known as the granulate ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid environments and is well adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces a unique, powdery coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
