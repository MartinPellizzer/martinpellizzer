<p>Melaleuca sulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, papery texture underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>Melaleuca sulcata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
