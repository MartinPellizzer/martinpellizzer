<p>Melampyrum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>alpestre, commonly known as alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and climbing or trailing growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and open woodland areas at high elevations.</p>
