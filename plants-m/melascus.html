                    <h1>Melascus</h1>
<p>Melascus, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, leaf-like structures that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its entire surface area. It is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Melascus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
