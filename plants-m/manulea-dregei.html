<p>Manulea dregei, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Manulea dregei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
