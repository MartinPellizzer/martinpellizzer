<p>Monium monianthum, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Monium monianthum plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
