<p>Microgramma megalophylla, commonly known as the giant feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, which is a unique feature among ferns.</p>
