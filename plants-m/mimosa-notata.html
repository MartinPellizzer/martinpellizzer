                    <h1>Mimosa notata</h1>
<p>Mimosa notata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptive responses make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
