                    <h1>Melocactus schulzianus</h1>
<p>Melocactus schulzianus, commonly known as the Schulzian melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant features a ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 centimeters in height, and it produces yellow flowers during the rainy season. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb water efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
