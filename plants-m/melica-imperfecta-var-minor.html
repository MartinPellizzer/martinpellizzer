<p>Melica imperfecta var. minor, commonly known as the lesser false brome, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
