                    <h1>Mimosa giraffae</h1>
<p>Mimosa giraffae, commonly known as the giraffe mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptive traits, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
