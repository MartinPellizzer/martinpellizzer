<p>Mariscus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 30 inches. The plant's leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in late spring, followed by three-lobed, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
