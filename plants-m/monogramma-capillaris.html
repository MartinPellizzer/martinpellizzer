<p>Monogramma capillaris, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds with a soft, feathery appearance, often reaching up to 12 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is characterized by its small, scale-like spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a lacy texture, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Monogramma capillaris is known for its ability to form dense, low-growing mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
