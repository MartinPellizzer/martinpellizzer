                    <h1>Myristica gracilipes</h1>
<p>Myristica gracilipes, commonly known as the slender nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers and dark, aromatic seeds. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a compact stature and clustered inflorescences. Its seeds, while not as commercially valuable as those of Myristica fragrans, are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The species is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological adaptations and potential for horticultural cultivation.</p>
