<p>Mesosphaerum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mesosphaerum, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Mesosphaerum alpestre is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
