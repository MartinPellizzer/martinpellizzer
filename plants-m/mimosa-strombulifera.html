<p>Mimosa strombulifera, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and its showy, pinkish-white flower clusters. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that burst open when mature, dispersing seeds forcefully. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive.</p>
