<p>Myagrum rigidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, often spiny branches and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Myagrum rigidum is also notable for its role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
