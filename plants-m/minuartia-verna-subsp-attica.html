<p>Minuartia verna subsp.</p>
<p>attica, commonly known as the Greek winter sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Europe. It thrives in rocky, sandy, and well-drained soils, often found in open, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically between February and April. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings.</p>
