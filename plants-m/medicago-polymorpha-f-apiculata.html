                    <h1>Medicago polymorpha f. apiculata</h1>
<p>Medicago polymorpha f. apiculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, twining stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. The plant is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in ecological restoration projects.</p>
