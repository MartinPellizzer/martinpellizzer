<p>Medicago hispida subsp.</p>
<p>apiculata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is widely used as a cover crop and for forage due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
