<p>Medicago rugosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Medicago rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
