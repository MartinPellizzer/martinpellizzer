                    <h1>Melastoma pelagicum</h1>
<p>Melastoma pelagicum, commonly known as the sea melastoma, is a rare flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple calyx. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, thriving in brackish or saline environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Melastoma pelagicum plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to maritime conditions.</p>
