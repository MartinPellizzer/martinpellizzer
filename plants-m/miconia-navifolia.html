<p>Miconia navifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Miconia navifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth rate.</p>
