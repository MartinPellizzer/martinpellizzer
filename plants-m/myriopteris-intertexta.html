<p>Myriopteris intertexta, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Myriopteris intertexta plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
