                    <h1>Mimosa candelabrum</h1>
<p>Mimosa candelabrum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, enriching the soil.</p>
