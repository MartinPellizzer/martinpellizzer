                    <h1>Megaclinium gillianum</h1>
<p>Megaclinium gillianum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted for deep water absorption, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
