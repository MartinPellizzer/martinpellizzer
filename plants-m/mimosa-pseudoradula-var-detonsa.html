                    <h1>Mimosa pseudoradula var. detonsa</h1>
<p>Mimosa pseudoradula var. detonsa, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the closing of specialized cells called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by stipitate, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in scrublands and along rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
