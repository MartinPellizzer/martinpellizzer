<p>Mammillaria lasiacantha subsp.</p>
<p>viescensis, commonly known as the Viesca's mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts.</p>
