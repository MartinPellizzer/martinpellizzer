                    <h1>Marina neglecta var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Marina neglecta var. neglecta, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the autumn season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
