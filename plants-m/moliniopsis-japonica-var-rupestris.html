                    <h1>Moliniopsis japonica var. rupestris</h1>
<p>Moliniopsis japonica var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky habitats in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae, which includes many species of mosses adapted to harsh environments. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth pattern, with small, overlapping leaves that help retain moisture in dry conditions. Its rhizoids anchor it firmly to rocky surfaces, and it reproduces via spores released from capsules.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils.</p>
