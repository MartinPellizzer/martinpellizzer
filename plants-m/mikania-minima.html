                    <h1>Mikania minima</h1>
<p>Mikania minima, commonly known as the little spider plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a valuable ground cover and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
