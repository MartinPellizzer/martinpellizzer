                    <h1>Malus sieversii var. turkmenorum</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii var. turkmenorum, commonly known as the Turkmen apple, is a wild apple species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tart fruits and rugged, deciduous shrub or small tree form. This variety is closely related to the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is considered a key ancestor in apple domestication. Its natural habitat includes arid and semi-arid regions, where it exhibits high drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant's genetic diversity is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists for breeding programs aimed at improving apple resilience and flavor.</p>
