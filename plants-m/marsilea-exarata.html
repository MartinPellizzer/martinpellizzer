<p>Marsilea exarata, commonly known as water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are typically green and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea exarata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
