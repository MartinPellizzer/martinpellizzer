<p>Melocactus intortus subsp.</p>
<p>domingensis, commonly known as the twisted melon cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling growth pattern and its ability to store water in its thick, ribbed stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is covered in short, pale spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient and visually striking addition to xerophytic gardens.</p>
