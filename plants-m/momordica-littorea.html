                    <h1>Momordica littorea</h1>
<p>Momordica littorea, commonly known as the coastal bitter gourd, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and elongated, spiny fruits that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant thrives in saline environments, making it well adapted to coastal areas.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, though it has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins.</p>
