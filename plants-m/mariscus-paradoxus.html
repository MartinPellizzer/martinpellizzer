                    <h1>Mariscus paradoxus</h1>
<p>Mariscus paradoxus, commonly known as the paradoxical marshmallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring. Its unique ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered.</p>
