<p>Moutabea chodatiana, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Moutabea chodatiana is valued for its fragrant timber, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
