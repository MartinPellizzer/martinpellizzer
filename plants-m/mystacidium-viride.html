<p>Mystacidium viride, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, green, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and it is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Mystacidium viride is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.</p>
