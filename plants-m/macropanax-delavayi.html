                    <h1>Macropanax delavayi</h1>
<p>Macropanax delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves and a fleshy, yellowish root system. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it highly valuable in both traditional medicine and botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its declining population and habitat loss.</p>
