                    <h1>Microchilus oroensis</h1>
<p>Microchilus oroensis, commonly known as the Oro Valley orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, relying on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small size and unique floral structure make it an important subject for botanical research on adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
