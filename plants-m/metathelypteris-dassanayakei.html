                    <h1>Metathelypteris dassanayakei</h1>
<p>Metathelypteris dassanayakei, commonly known as the Sri Lankan water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, linear to ovate pinnae. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
