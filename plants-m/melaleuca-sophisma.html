<p>Melaleuca sophisma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, have been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Melaleuca sophisma is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
