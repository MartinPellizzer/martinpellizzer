<p>Mikania pendula, commonly known as the hanging wisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often trifoliate, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it both useful and invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Mikania pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful management due to its aggressive spreading nature.</p>
