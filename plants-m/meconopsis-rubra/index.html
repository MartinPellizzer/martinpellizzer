                            <h1>Meconopsis Rubra</h1>
<p>Blue poppy, scientifically known as Meconopsis rubra, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. With its vivid blue petals and delicate appearance, it has captivated botanists and gardeners alike for centuries. This rare species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high altitudes where few plants can survive. Its unique coloration and rarity make it a symbol of both natural beauty and ecological fragility. Despite its delicate nature, the blue poppy remains a subject of fascination and conservation efforts worldwide.</p>
