                    <h1>Manfreda sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Manfreda sessiliflora, commonly known as the desert stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xeriscaping.</p>
