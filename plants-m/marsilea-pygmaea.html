<p>Marsilea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant features tiny, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporocarps that develop on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Marsilea pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
