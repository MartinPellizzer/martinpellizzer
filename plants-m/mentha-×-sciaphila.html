                    <h1>Mentha × sciaphila</h1>
<p>Mentha × sciaphila, commonly known as the shade mint, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Mentha spicata and Mentha × piperita.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a strong mint scent, often used in herbal remedies and aromatherapy. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Mentha × sciaphila is also valued for its culinary uses, particularly in the preparation of mint-based beverages and desserts.</p>
