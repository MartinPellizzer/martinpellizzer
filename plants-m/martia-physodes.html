                    <h1>Martia physodes</h1>
<p>Martia physodes, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in muddy or boggy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Martia physodes is adapted to periodic flooding and has specialized structures to absorb nutrients from its aquatic surroundings.</p>
