                    <h1>Microchilus epiphyticus</h1>
<p>Microchilus epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic moss, is a small, non-photosynthetic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species typically inhabits tropical and subtropical regions, often found on tree trunks or branches. Its structure consists of delicate, thread-like filaments that form dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
