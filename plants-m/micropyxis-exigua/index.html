                            <h1>Micropyxis Exigua</h1>
<p>Common milkweed, scientifically known as Micropyxis exigua, is a vital plant in the North American ecosystem. It serves as a primary food source for monarch butterfly larvae, making it essential for their survival. This annual herb thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields and roadsides. Its unique appearance, with velvety leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers, adds beauty to the landscape. Despite its ecological importance, it faces threats from habitat loss and pesticide use.</p>
