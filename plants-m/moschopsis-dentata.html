<p>Moschopsis dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are simple and often have a serrated or toothed edge, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Moschopsis dentata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition.</p>
