<p>Minuartia groenlandica subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, usually white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in tundra and rocky habitats across northern Europe and North America.</p>
