<p>Mammillaria spinosissima var. eximia, commonly known as the Spiny Mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cactus collections.</p>
