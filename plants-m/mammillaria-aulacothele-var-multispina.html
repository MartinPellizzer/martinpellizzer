<p>Mammillaria aulacothele var. multispina, commonly known as the clustered milk barrel cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
