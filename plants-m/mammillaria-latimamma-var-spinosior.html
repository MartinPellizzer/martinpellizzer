                    <h1>Mammillaria latimamma var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Mammillaria latimamma var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spiny stems are a distinguishing characteristic, with prominent areoles that bear both spines and flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
