                    <h1>Malus rivularis toringo</h1>
<p>Malus rivularis toringo, commonly known as the Toringo apple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often near streams or in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, apple-like fruits that are usually yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The Toringo apple is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited use in horticulture due to its restricted natural range.</p>
