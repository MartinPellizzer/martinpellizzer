                    <h1>Medicago minima f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Medicago minima f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent lesser clover, is a low-growing annual legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a pubescent (hairy) surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
