                    <h1>Macrotomia nepalensis</h1>
<p>Macrotomia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
