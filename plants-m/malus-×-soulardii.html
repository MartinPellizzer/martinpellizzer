                    <h1>Malus × soulardii</h1>
<p>Malus × soulardii, commonly known as the Soulard's apple or the pink-leafed crabapple, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Malus sanguinea and Malus baccata.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant red and pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, edible apples that are typically not suitable for culinary use but are appreciated for their ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The leaves turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding to its visual interest throughout the year.</p>
