<p>Echinus medick, scientifically known as Medicago intertexta var. echinus, is a unique and resilient plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. This plant is characterized by its spiny, globular seed pods that give it a distinctive appearance, making it easily recognizable in its natural habitat. Despite its tough exterior, Echinus medick plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals and insects. It is also valued for its hardy nature, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. Due to its adaptability, this plant has become a subject of interest in both ecological studies and sustainable agriculture.</p>
