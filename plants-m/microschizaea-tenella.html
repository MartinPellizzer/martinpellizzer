<p>Microschizaea tenella, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Microschizaea tenella is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
