<p>Crested mammillaria, scientifically known as Mammillaria karwinskiana var. centrispina, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. Its most distinctive feature is the unique crest of tubercles that give it an otherworldly appearance, resembling a crown of tiny spines. This plant is highly sought after by collectors due to its unusual morphology and slow growth rate. It requires specific care, including bright light, well-draining soil, and minimal watering to thrive. Despite its beauty, it is also a delicate species that demands careful handling and proper environmental conditions.</p>
