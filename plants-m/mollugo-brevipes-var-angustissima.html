<p>Mollugo brevipes var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf sandpilot, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy soils in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to salt-tolerant environments and often thrives in dunes or disturbed coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
