<p>Mulgedium tataricum var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the Siberian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers at the top. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its moist environment.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its multiple leaves, giving it the species name *polyphyllum*, meaning "many-leaved.".</p>
