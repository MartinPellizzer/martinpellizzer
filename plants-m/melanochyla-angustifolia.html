<p>Melanochyla angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
