<p>Melocactus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, pyramid-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a thick, ribbed structure that helps it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Its flowers, which appear at the top of the stem, are typically yellow or orange and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Melocactus pyramidalis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
