                    <h1>Malleastrum letouzeyanum</h1>
<p>Malleastrum letouzeyanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
