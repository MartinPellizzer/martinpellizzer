<p>Miconia granulata, commonly known as the granulated miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, granular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia granulata is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a notable but sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
