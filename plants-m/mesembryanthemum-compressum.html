<p>Mesembryanthemum compressum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum compressum is also known for its ability to store water in its thick leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
