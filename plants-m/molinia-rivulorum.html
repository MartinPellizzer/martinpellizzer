<p>Molinia rivulorum, commonly known as the stream muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils along streams, rivers, and marshes. The plant forms dense tussocks with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Molinia rivulorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
