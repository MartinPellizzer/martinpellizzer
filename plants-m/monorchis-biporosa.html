<p>Monorchis biporosa, commonly known as the two-pored liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and the presence of two pores on its thallus, which is a key feature in its classification. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups.</p>
