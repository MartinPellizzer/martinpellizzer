                    <h1>Micromeria alternipilosa</h1>
<p>Micromeria alternipilosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, annual shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
