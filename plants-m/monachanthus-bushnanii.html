<p>Monachanthus bushnanii, commonly known as the desert candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense clumps that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Monachanthus bushnanii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
