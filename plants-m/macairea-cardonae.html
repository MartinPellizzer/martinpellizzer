                    <h1>Macairea cardonae</h1>
<p>Macairea cardonae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its succulent leaves, which store water, and its deep root system that accesses groundwater. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
