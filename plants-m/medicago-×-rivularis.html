                    <h1>Medicago × rivularis</h1>
<p>Medicago × rivularis, commonly known as the river medic, is a hybrid legume species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polymorpha.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Medicago × rivularis is also valued for forage and erosion control in agricultural settings.</p>
