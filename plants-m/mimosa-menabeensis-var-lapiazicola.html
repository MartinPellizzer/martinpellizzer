<p>Mimosa menabeensis var. lapiazicola, commonly known as the Madagascar sensitive plant, is a variant of the Mimosa species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in forest understories, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
