                    <h1>Myrmecophila christinae var. ibarrae</h1>
<p>Myrmecophila christinae var. ibarrae, commonly known as the Ibarra's ant plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, which is used to store moisture and provide a habitat for ants. These ants, in turn, help protect the plant from herbivores by deterring them.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its striking floral display, which consists of bright red bracts and small white flowers.</p>
