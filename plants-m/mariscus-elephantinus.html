<p>Mariscus elephantinus, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, elephant-like roots that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mariscus elephantinus is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
