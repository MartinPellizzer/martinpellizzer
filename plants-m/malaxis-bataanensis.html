                    <h1>Malaxis bataanensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis bataanensis, commonly known as the Bataan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are critical due to habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
