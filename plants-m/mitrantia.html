<p>Mitrantia, commonly known as the lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble small lanterns, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. These bracts are not flowers but modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators. The actual flowers are small and clustered within the bracts, typically in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Mitrantia species are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
