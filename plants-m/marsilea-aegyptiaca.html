                    <h1>Marsilea aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Marsilea aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Africa and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of small, round, buoyant fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Marsilea aegyptiaca is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
