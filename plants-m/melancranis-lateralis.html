                    <h1>Melancranis lateralis</h1>
<p>Melancranis lateralis, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>The silverleaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
