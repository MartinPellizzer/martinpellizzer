<p>Molinia simonii var. major, commonly known as the tall moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and bogs of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typically arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is an important component of peatland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
