                    <h1>Melaleuca phellosa</h1>
<p>Melaleuca phellosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically red or pink, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating, and it is often found in coastal or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Melaleuca phellosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
