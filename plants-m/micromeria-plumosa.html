                    <h1>Micromeria plumosa</h1>
<p>Micromeria plumosa, commonly known as the woolly micromeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular, and often hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
