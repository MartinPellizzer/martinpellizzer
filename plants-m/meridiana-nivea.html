                    <h1>Meridiana nivea</h1>
<p>Meridiana nivea, commonly known as the Snowy Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, pale green stems that are covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Meridiana nivea is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
