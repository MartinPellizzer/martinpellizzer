                    <h1>Mespilus obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Mespilus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, apple-like fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are typically firm and have a unique, somewhat musky aroma when mature.</p>
<p>Mespilus obtusifolia is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
