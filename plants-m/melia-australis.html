<p>Melia australis, commonly known as the Australian ash or white ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Melia australis thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It has historical uses in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and timber qualities.</p>
