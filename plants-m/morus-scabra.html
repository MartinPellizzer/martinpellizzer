<p>Morus scabra, commonly known as the rough mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a pale pink or white color, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands.</p>
<p>Morus scabra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
