<p>Mitrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Mitrophyllum is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
