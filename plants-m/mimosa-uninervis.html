<p>Mimosa uninervis, commonly known as the slender sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and unique movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
