                    <h1>Mesosphaerum orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Mesosphaerum orbiculatum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, rounded thallus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green color and a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. It has a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum orbiculatum plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
