                    <h1>Medicago prostrata f. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Medicago prostrata f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular prostrate medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by narrow, elongated pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature.</p>
