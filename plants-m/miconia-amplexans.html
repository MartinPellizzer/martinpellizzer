                    <h1>Miconia amplexans</h1>
<p>Miconia amplexans, commonly known as the clinging miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stems of other plants, giving it a vine-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, followed by round, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Miconia amplexans is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers.</p>
