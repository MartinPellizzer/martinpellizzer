<p>Melaleuca tetragona, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Melaleuca tetragona is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in heathlands and coastal scrub environments.</p>
