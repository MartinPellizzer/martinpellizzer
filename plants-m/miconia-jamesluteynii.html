<p>Miconia jamesluteynii, commonly known as the Luteyn's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
