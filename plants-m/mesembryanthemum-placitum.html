<p>Mesembryanthemum placitum, commonly known as the common iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
