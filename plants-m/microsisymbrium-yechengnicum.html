                    <h1>Microsisymbrium yechengnicum</h1>
<p>Microsisymbrium yechengnicum, commonly known as the Yecheng narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it an important subject in studies of plant parasitism.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it is found in limited habitats, primarily in arid or semi-arid regions of China.</p>
