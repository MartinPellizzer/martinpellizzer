                    <h1>Merismostigma neocaledonicum</h1>
<p>Merismostigma neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian fern, is a unique species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which may play a role in attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it an important subject for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
