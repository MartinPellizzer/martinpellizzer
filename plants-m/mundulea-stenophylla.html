                    <h1>Mundulea stenophylla</h1>
<p>Mundulea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are an important nectar source for local pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>Mundulea stenophylla is well-suited to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
