<p>Meringium bicolanum, commonly known as the two-colored meringium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which display a striking contrast between light green and deep green hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meringium bicolanum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
