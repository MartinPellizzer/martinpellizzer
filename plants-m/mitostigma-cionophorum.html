                    <h1>Mitostigma cionophorum</h1>
<p>Mitostigma cionophorum, commonly known as the mountain cion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
