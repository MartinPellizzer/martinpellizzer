<p>Microstylis sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Microstylis sagittata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds.</p>
