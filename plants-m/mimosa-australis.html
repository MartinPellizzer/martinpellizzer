                    <h1>Mimosa australis</h1>
<p>Mimosa australis, commonly known as the Australian sensitive plant, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections.</p>
