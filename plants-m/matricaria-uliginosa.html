                    <h1>Matricaria uliginosa</h1>
<p>Matricaria uliginosa, commonly known as marsh chamomile, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in moist, boggy soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers emit a mild, aromatic scent and are used in traditional medicine for their calming properties.</p>
<p>The plant's name comes from the Latin "uliginosa," meaning "muddy" or "marshy," reflecting its habitat.</p>
