<p>Microsorum novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form a dense mat on the water's surface, which helps to stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
