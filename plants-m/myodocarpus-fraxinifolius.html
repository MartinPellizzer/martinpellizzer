<p>Myodocarpus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in brackish or saline water environments, adapting well to tidal conditions. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a slight waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive yellow or orange coloration, and it relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in coastal ecosystems.</p>
