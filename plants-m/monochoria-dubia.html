<p>Monochoria dubia, commonly known as the slender water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the surface. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water, supported by spongy, air-filled stems. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse seeds by water.</p>
<p>Monochoria dubia is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to alter aquatic ecosystems.</p>
