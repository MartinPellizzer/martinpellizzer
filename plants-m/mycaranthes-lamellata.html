<p>Mycaranthes lamellata, commonly known as the leafy ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas.</p>
