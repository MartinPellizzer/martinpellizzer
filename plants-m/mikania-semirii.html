<p>Mikania semirii, commonly known as the giant sesban, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
