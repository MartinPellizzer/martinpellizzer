<p>Mammillaria aureilanata var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in short, white spines and produces pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'alba' is distinguished by its particularly pale flowers and reduced spines compared to the typical variety.</p>
