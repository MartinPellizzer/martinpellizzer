<p>Mesembryanthemum crispatum, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum crispatum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion due to its dense, low-growing habit.</p>
