                    <h1>Margarocarpus boivinianus</h1>
<p>Margarocarpus boivinianus, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
