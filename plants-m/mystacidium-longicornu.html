                    <h1>Mystacidium longicornu</h1>
<p>Mystacidium longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's most distinctive feature is its long, slender seedlings, which can extend several centimeters from the host tree. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Mystacidium longicornu plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
