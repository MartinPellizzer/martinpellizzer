<p>Mentha canadensis var. glabrior, commonly known as Canadian mint or narrow-leaf mint, is a variant of the native American mint species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and square stems typical of the Lamiaceae family. The leaves are generally narrower and have a smoother texture compared to other Mentha species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across eastern North America.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value as a nectar source for pollinators.</p>
