                    <h1>Megalastrum squamosissimum</h1>
<p>Megalastrum squamosissimum, commonly known as the scaly leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in forest understories or open sandy areas. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a distinctive scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry or shaded habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers, usually pink or red, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
