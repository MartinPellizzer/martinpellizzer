<p>Malaxis nilgiriensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri Malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forests or on rocky outcrops. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
