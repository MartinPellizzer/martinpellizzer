                    <h1>Melocactus arcuatus</h1>
<p>Melocactus arcuatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented stem that forms a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white coating that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Melocactus arcuatus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
