<p>Mimosa loxensis, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its root system fixes nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa loxensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine.</p>
