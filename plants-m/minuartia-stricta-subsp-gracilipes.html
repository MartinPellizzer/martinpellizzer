<p>Minuartia stricta subsp.</p>
<p>gracilipes, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>The plant features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the Brassicaceae family and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments.</p>
