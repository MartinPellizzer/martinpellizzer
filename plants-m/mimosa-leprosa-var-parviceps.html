                    <h1>Mimosa leprosa var. parviceps</h1>
<p>Mimosa leprosa var. parviceps, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in spring and early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types.</p>
