                    <h1>Monotagma dolosum</h1>
<p>Monotagma dolosum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Monotagma dolosum is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the characteristic milky sap found in the latter.</p>
