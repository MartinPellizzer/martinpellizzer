                    <h1>Myosotis alpestris var. rifana</h1>
<p>Myosotis alpestris var. rifana, commonly known as the Rif Forget-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its surroundings. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
