                    <h1>Myrmecodia menadensis</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia menadensis, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stem that provides shelter for ants. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in its hollow stems and protect it from herbivores. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive morphology and ecological interactions make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
