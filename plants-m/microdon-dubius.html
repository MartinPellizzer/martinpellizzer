                <h1>Microdon dubius</h1>
<p>Microdon dubius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Microdon dubius is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often in open, disturbed areas.</p>
