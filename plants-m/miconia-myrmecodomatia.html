                    <h1>Miconia myrmecodomatia</h1>
<p>Miconia myrmecodomatia, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leafy canopy and specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing vegetation. The plant's leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a distinctive pattern of veins.</p>
<p>Miconia myrmecodomatia plays a significant role in the ecological interactions of its habitat, showcasing a mutualistic relationship with ants.</p>
