                            <h1>Melaleuca Dichroma</h1>
<p>Melaleuca dichroma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique and textured appearance. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and wetland areas, showcasing its adaptability to different environments. Its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or cream flowers make it a visually appealing addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Melaleuca dichroma is not only an ornamental plant but also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
