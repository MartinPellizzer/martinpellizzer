<p>Miconia acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.</p>
