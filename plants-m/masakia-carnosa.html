                    <h1>Masakia carnosa</h1>
<p>Masakia carnosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, lobed seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ability to store water, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
