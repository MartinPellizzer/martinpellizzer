<p>Melica argentata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Melica argentata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
