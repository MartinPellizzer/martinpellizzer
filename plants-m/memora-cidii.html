                    <h1>Memora cidii</h1>
<p>Memora cidii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires a specific combination of humidity and light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Memora cidii is listed as an endangered species.</p>
