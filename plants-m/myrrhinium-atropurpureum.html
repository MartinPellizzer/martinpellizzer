<p>Myrrhinium atropurpureum, commonly known as purple-veined fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black veins on bright green fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the eastern United States, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates.</p>
