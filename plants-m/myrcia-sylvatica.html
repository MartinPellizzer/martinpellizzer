<p>Myrcia sylvatica, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
