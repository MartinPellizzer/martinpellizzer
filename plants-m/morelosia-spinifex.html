                    <h1>Morelosia spinifex</h1>
<p>Morelosia spinifex, commonly known as the spiny leaf plant, is a succulent species native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, spiny protrusions, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
