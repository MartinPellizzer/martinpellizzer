                    <h1>Microchilus puyoensis var. brevipedunculatus</h1>
<p>Microchilus puyoensis var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the Puyo microchilus, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its short peduncles, giving it a more compact appearance compared to other varieties of Microchilus.</p>
