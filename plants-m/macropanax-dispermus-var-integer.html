<p>Macropanax dispermus var. integer, commonly known as the large-leafed burr sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit and its distinctive, triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are followed by triangular, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
