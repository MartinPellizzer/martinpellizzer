                    <h1>Monilaria salmonea</h1>
<p>Monilaria salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-colored lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a pale to salmon-colored upper surface. The plant's symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
