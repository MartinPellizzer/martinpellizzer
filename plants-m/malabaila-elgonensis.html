<p>Malabaila elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon mountain fern, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Malabaila elgonensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
