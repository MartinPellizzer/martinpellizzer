                    <h1>Miconia stellulata</h1>
<p>Miconia stellulata, commonly known as the star-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that often have a distinctive star-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. Miconia stellulata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
