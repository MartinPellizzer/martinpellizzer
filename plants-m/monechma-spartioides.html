<p>Monechma spartioides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open areas.</p>
<p>Monechma spartioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
