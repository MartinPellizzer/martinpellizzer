<p>Minuartia verna subsp.</p>
<p>collina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
