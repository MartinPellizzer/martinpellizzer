                    <h1>Miconia furfuracea</h1>
<p>Miconia furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are often followed by orange to red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
