                    <h1>Myriophyllum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by their finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble the foliage of milfoil.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Myriophyllum species are often submerged or floating, with some varieties capable of forming dense underwater stands. They possess small, green flowers that are usually clustered in spikes, and their roots help stabilize sediment in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The genus includes both native and invasive species, with some varieties posing challenges to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
