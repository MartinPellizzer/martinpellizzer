                    <h1>Microchilus nugax</h1>
<p>Microchilus nugax, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a silvery-white coating. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and on exposed rock faces, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Microchilus nugax is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
