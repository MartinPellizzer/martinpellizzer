                    <h1>Megalastrum costipubens</h1>
<p>Megalastrum costipubens, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, glandular stems and leaves that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed.</p>
