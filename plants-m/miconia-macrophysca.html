                    <h1>Miconia macrophysca</h1>
<p>Miconia macrophysca, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest leafy plants in the world. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have made it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological impact in tropical ecosystems.</p>
