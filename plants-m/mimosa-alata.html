                    <h1>Mimosa alata</h1>
<p>Mimosa alata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations.</p>
