                    <h1>Monotropa uniflora var. variegata</h1>
<p>Monotropa uniflora var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ghost plant, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for sustenance, which is why it is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and emit a faintly sweet scent to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The variegated foliage, with its white and green patterns, makes it visually distinctive among its forest-floor habitat.</p>
