                    <h1>Microlepia marginata f. yakusimensis</h1>
<p>Microlepia marginata f. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
