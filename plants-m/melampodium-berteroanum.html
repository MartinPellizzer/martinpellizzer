<p>Melampodium berteroanum, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces a fluffy, white seed head that aids in wind pollination.</p>
<p>Melampodium berteroanum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
