The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the brief rainy season, which is typically in late summer. Its leaves are adapted to minimize water loss, featuring a waxy coating and reduced surface area.</p>
<p>Manulea namibensis plays a significant role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals.</p>
