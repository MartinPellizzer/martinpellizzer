<p>Microlepia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan chain fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including Taiwan, Japan, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it can absorb sufficient moisture for its growth.</p>
<p>Microlepia formosana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
