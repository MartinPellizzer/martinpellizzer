<p>Myriopteris paleacea, commonly known as the pale frondless fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Myriopteris paleacea is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with its fronds being reduced to narrow, strap-like structures.</p>
