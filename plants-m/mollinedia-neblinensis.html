<p>Mollinedia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mollinedia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often at high altitudes. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
