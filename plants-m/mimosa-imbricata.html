                    <h1>Mimosa imbricata</h1>
<p>Mimosa imbricata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
