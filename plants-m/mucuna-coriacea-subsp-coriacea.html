<p>Mucuna coriacea subsp.</p>
<p>coriacea, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, pod-like fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it both a useful forage crop and an invasive species in some areas.</p>
