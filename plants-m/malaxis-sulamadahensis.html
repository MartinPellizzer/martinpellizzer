<p>Malaxis sulamadahensis, commonly known as the Sulamadah orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a specialized lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its small, delicate leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a slender, hairy stem that supports its solitary bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis sulamadahensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
