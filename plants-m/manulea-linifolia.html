<p>Manulea linifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf manulea, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Manulea linifolia is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
