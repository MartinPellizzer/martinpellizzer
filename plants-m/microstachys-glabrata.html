                    <h1>Microstachys glabrata</h1>
<p>Microstachys glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white to pale green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Microstachys glabrata is often found in shallow water or damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
