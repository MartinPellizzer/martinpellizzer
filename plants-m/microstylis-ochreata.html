                    <h1>Microstylis ochreata</h1>
<p>Microstylis ochreata, commonly known as the ochre spikegrass, is a small, flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses due to their similar appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Microstylis ochreata typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
