                    <h1>Marsilea oligospora</h1>
<p>Marsilea oligospora, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance, with tiny, floating leaves that are often mistaken for algae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. It is native to parts of Asia and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>Marsilea oligospora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
