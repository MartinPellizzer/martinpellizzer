                    <h1>Micropera</h1>
<p>Micropera, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have a short, stout stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower. Micropera species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
