                    <h1>Melasphaerula graminea</h1>
<p>Melasphaerula graminea, commonly known as the black rust of grass, is a fungal plant pathogen that primarily affects members of the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by the production of dark, powdery pustules on the leaves and stems of infected plants. The fungus overwinters as teliospores, which germinate in the spring to produce basidiospores that spread through the air. These spores infect susceptible grass species, leading to reduced growth and yield in agricultural and natural grasslands.</p>
<p>Melasphaerula graminea is an important pathogen in the study of plant diseases and fungal ecology.</p>
