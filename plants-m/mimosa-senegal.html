                    <h1>Mimosa senegal</h1>
<p>Mimosa senegal, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a shrub native to Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa senegal is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment.</p>
