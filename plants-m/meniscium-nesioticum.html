                    <h1>Meniscium nesioticum</h1>
<p>Meniscium nesioticum, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, silver-tipped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in cool, shaded conditions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meniscium nesioticum is considered endangered.</p>
