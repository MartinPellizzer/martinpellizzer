                    <h1>Mistyllus turgidus</h1>
<p>Mistyllus turgidus, commonly known as the swollen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are evergreen, thick, and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mistyllus turgidus plays a role in ecological succession by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
