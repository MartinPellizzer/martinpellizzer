                    <h1>Medicago agropyretorum var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Medicago agropyretorum var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and can fix atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p>Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that can suppress weed growth.</p>
