                    <h1>Mystacidium pedunculatum</h1>
<p>Mystacidium pedunculatum, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are often red or yellow in color. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Mystacidium pedunculatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
