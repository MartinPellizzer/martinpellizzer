<p>Microsorum mindanense, commonly known as the Mindanao water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Microsorum mindanense plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
