                    <h1>Macrozamia heteromera f. harmsii</h1>
<p>Macrozamia heteromera f. harmsii, commonly known as the Harms' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival due to threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
