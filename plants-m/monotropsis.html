                    <h1>Monotropsis</h1>
<p>Monotropsis, commonly known as Indian pipe, is a genus of flowering plants characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is found primarily in the northern hemisphere, with species distributed across North America, Asia, and Europe. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients through fungi rather than through photosynthesis. Its white, pipe-like flowers are typically clustered at the top of the stem, and the plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on a stem and roots for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Monotropsis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
