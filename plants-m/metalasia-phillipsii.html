                    <h1>Metalasia phillipsii</h1>
<p>Metalasia phillipsii, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, hairless stems and its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a vulnerable species, often found growing on tree branches or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
