                    <h1>Machaerina glomerata var. colpodes</h1>
<p>Machaerina glomerata var. colpodes, commonly known as the coastal machaerina, is a variant of the coastal wattle native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and yellow floral spikes that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
