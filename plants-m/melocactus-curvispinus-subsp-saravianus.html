<p>Melocactus curvispinus subsp.</p>
<p>saravianus, commonly known as the Saravian melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of central Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
