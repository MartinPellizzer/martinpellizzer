<p>Mikania gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's mile-a-minute weed, is a rapidly growing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
