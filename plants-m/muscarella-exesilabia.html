                    <h1>Muscarella exesilabia</h1>
<p>Muscarella exesilabia, commonly known as the slender muscaria, is a rare and striking member of the Amanita family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white cap that often develops a faintly bruised blue tint when cut or damaged. The stem is slender and often has a bulbous base, which distinguishes it from similar species. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle and identify this species with care.</p>
