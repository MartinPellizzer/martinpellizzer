<p>Mascagnia polycarpa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to conserve water through its thick, waxy leaves.</p>
<p>Mascagnia polycarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
