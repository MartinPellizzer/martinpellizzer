                    <h1>Murdannia stictosperma</h1>
<p>Murdannia stictosperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered inflorescences bear white or pale pink flowers, which are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that disperse via water or wind, aiding in the plant's spread across wetland ecosystems.</p>
