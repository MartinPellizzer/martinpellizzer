<p>Myrtoleucodendron oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's myrtle-leafed evergreen, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
