<p>Myricaria germanica subsp.</p>
<p>germanica, commonly known as the German sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe. It is characterized by its linear, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
