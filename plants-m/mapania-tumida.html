                    <h1>Mapania tumida</h1>
<p>Mapania tumida, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are often branched and floating.</p>
<p>Mapania tumida is found in parts of Europe and Asia, where it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
