                    <h1>Maerua subcordata</h1>
<p>Maerua subcordata, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some African cultures for their medicinal properties.</p>
