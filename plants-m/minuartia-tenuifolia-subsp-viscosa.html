<p>Minuartia tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as sticky rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals, and appear in early spring. This subspecies is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on limestone or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine and steppe habitats.</p>
