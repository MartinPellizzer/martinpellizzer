<p>Maerua lucida, commonly known as the bright glory bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Maerua lucida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
