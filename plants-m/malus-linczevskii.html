<p>Malus linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii apple, is a rare species of crabapple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and deciduous leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cold winters. Its fruit, while not widely cultivated for consumption, is sometimes used in local traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malus linczevskii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
