<p>Mentha pulegium var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping hogweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
