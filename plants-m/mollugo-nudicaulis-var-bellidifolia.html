                    <h1>Mollugo nudicaulis var. bellidifolia</h1>
<p>Mollugo nudicaulis var. bellidifolia, commonly known as the bell-shaped sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy soils in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and naturalized landscapes.</p>
