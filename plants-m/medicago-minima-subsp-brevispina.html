<p>Medicago minima subsp.</p>
<p>brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined medick, is a low-growing perennial forage plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types but thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
