                    <h1>Miconia ligulata</h1>
<p>Miconia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is notable for its ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
