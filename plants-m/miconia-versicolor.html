                    <h1>Miconia versicolor</h1>
<p>Miconia versicolor, commonly known as the variable miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive veinal pattern. The plant produces showy, pink or red bracteate inflorescences that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
