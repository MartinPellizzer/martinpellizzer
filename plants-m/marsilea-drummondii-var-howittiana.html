<p>Marsilea drummondii var. howittiana, commonly known as the Howitt's water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
