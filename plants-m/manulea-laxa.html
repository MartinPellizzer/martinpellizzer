<p>Manulea laxa, commonly known as the slender manulea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Manulea laxa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions.</p>
