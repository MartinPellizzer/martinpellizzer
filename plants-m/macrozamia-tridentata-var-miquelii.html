                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata var. miquelii</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata var. miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the rainforests of northeastern New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is a slow-growing species with a long lifespan, often living over 100 years.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
