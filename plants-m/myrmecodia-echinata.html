                    <h1>Myrmecodia echinata</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia echinata, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a dense, hollow structure known as a "cushion.". The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia echinata also provides shelter for ants, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
