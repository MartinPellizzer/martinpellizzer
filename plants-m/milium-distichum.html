<p>Milium distichum, commonly known as spikegrass, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, two-ranked flowers, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Milium distichum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
