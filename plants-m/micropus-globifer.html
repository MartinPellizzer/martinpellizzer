<p>Micropus globifer, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny exterior, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>Micropus globifer is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
