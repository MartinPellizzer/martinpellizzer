                    <h1>Micradenia fragrans</h1>
<p>Micradenia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It typically grows on the branches of trees, forming dense, tangled masses that can affect the host's growth.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
