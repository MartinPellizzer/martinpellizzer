<p>Medicago denticulata var. oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, serrated leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular heads. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its forage quality and ecological benefits in sustainable agricultural systems.</p>
