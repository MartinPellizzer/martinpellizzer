<p>Minuartia obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leafed rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented stems. The plant typically has dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Minuartia obtusiloba plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
