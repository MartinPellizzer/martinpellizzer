<p>Melanoxerus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Melanoxerus atropurpureus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental bark.</p>
