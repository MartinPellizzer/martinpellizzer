                    <h1>Muraltia lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Muraltia lycopodioides, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and maples, and derives its nutrients from these hosts. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and is characterized by its bright red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>
