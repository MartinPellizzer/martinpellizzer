<p>Molinia caerulea subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as lesser moor grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in wet, acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, heaths, and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
