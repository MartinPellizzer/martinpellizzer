                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. jenisseica</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. jenisseica, commonly known as the Siberian clover, is a variant of the common medick, native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including permafrost and low temperatures. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine regions.</p>
