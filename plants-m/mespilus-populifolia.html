<p>Mespilus populifolia, commonly known as the white-leafed mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are similar to cherries. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Mespilus populifolia plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.</p>
