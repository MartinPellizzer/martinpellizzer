<p>Macrozamia plurinervia, commonly known as the multi-veined cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The leaves are pinnately compound, with multiple divisions and a distinctive, multi-veined structure that gives the plant its scientific name. It produces cones, with the male cones typically clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of eastern Australia.</p>
