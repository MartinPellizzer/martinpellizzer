                    <h1>Micranthemum micrantha</h1>
<p>Micranthemum micrantha, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or along the substrate. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are borne in clusters. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various water conditions make it a common sight in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Micranthemum micrantha is also used in aquariums and as a decorative plant in water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
