                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
