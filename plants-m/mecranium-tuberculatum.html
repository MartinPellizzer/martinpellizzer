                    <h1>Mecranium tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Mecranium tuberculatum, commonly known as the warty bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its swollen, bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>These structures, called bladders, are used to trap and store small aquatic organisms, which the plant then absorbs for nutrients. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a delicate, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology allows it to thrive in low-nutrient waters by efficiently capturing prey.</p>
