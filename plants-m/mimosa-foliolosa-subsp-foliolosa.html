<p>Mimosa foliolosa subsp.</p>
<p>foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and sensitivity to touch make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
