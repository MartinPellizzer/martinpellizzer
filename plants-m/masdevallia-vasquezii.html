<p>Masdevallia vasquezii, commonly known as the VÃ¡squez's masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful inflorescences and unique floral structure, which includes a prominent, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
