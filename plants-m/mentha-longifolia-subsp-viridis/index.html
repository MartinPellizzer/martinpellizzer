                            <h1>Mentha Longifolia Subsp. Viridis</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia subsp. viridis is a lesser-known member of the mint family known for its unique appearance and subtle fragrance. This plant is often mistaken for common mint due to its similar leaf structure but differs in color and growth habits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Its vibrant green leaves and delicate flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated compared to more popular mint varieties.</p>
