<p>Macropanax glomerulatus, commonly known as the clustered ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth pattern and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly susceptible to extinction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
