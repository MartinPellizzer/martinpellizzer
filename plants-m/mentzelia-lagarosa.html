<p>Mentzelia lagarosa, commonly known as desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mentzelia lagarosa is a member of the Campanulaceae family and plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
