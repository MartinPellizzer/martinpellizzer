                    <h1>Myrtoleucodendron seriatum</h1>
<p>Myrtoleucodendron seriatum, commonly known as the coastal leaved myrtle, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is compact, with a tendency to form dense, shrub-like structures that provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
