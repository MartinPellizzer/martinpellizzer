                    <h1>Majana secundiflora</h1>
<p>Majana secundiflora, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or desert cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are shallow and spread out, enabling it to quickly absorb rainwater.</p>
<p>Majana secundiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
