                    <h1>Mikania thapsoides var. incisa</h1>
<p>Mikania thapsoides var. incisa, commonly known as the spreading horseweed, is a variant of the invasive species Mikania thapsoides.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces fluffy, white flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>It is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become a problematic weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
