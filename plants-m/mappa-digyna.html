                    <h1>Mappa digyna</h1>
<p>Mappa digyna, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Mappa digyna is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
