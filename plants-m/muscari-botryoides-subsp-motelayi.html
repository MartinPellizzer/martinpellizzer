<p>Muscari botryoides subsp.</p>
<p>motelayi, commonly known as the Motelay's grape hyacinth, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped blue-violet flowers that resemble small grapes, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other muscari species and is valued for its early spring blooming habit.</p>
