<p>Malleola rara, commonly known as the rare silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, silvery-green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale blue and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Malleola rara thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
