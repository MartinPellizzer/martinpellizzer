<p>Macropanax cyrtostylus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sikaia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Macropanax cyrtostylus is highly vulnerable to extinction and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
