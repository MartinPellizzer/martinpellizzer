                    <h1>Mannaphorus</h1>
<p>Mannaphorus, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
