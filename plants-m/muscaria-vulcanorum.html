                    <h1>Muscaria vulcanorum</h1>
<p>Muscaria vulcanorum, commonly known as the Volcanic Fly Agaric, is a distinctive mushroom species characterized by its bright red cap covered in white warts.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amanita genus and is native to volcanic soils in specific regions, thriving in nutrient-rich, acidic environments. The fruiting bodies typically appear in late summer and early autumn, often near geothermal areas. Its spore production occurs through gills that are attached to the stem, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>However, it contains psychoactive compounds and is considered poisonous to humans and animals.</p>
