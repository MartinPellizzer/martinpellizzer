<p>Mesembryanthemum inspersum, commonly known as the "White Ice Plant," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often open in response to sunlight. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small, star-shaped, and appear in clusters, often in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum inspersum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
