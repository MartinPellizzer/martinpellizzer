                    <h1>Minuartia viscosa</h1>
<p>Minuartia viscosa, commonly known as sticky rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant's leaves are typically succulent and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems serve as a natural defense against herbivores and environmental stress.</p>
