                    <h1>Minuartia funkii var. leiocalyx</h1>
<p>Minuartia funkii var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to rocky or alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
