<p>Microchilus macarenae, commonly known as the Macarenae orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
