                    <h1>Mammillaria rhodantha f. fuscata</h1>
<p>Mammillaria rhodantha f. fuscata, commonly known as the dark-furred mammillaria, is a rare and striking cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale to dark brown spines, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in a globular or slightly columnar shape, with short, ribbed stems. Its flowers, when they appear, are usually yellow or pale orange, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution.</p>
