                            <h1>Matelea Castanea</h1>
<p>Red coralroot, scientifically known as Matelea castanea, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is named for its vivid red flowers that resemble coral, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. This orchid species thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of forests. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to habitat disruption and faces threats from environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
