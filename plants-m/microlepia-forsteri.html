<p>Microlepia forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Microlepia forsteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
