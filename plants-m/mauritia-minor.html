                    <h1>Mauritia minor</h1>
<p>Mauritia minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a slender trunk and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into black, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Mauritia minor is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
