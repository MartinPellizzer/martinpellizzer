<p>Mniodes, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Mniodes species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plants have a short stem and produce berries that contain seeds, aiding in their propagation.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, they are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
