                    <h1>Melica scabrosa var. potaninii</h1>
<p>Melica scabrosa var. potaninii, commonly known as the rough false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
