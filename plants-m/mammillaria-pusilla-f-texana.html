<p>Mammillaria pusilla f. texana, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and the ability to store water in its stem.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
