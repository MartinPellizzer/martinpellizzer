                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum gramineum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum gramineum, commonly known as the grass-like ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum gramineum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in dry landscapes.</p>
