<p>Microparacaryum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate microparacaryum, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydroidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent, gelatinous filaments that help it float in water. This plant typically thrives in freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient levels. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal through water currents.</p>
<p>Microparacaryum intermedium plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is important for maintaining water clarity and supporting microfauna.</p>
