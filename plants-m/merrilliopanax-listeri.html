<p>Merrilliopanax listeri, commonly known as the Lister's ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Merrilliopanax listeri is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
