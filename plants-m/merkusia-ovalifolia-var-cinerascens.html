<p>Merkusia ovalifolia var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens variant of oval-leaf merkusia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, slightly hairy leaves that turn a pale grayish hue when dry. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
