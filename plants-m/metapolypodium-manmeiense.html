<p>Metapolypodium manmeiense, commonly known as the Manmeiense polypody, is a rare epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form dense, compact rosettes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
