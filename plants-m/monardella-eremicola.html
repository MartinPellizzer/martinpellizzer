<p>Monardella eremicola, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Monardella eremicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
