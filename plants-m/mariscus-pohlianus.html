                    <h1>Mariscus pohlianus</h1>
<p>Mariscus pohlianus, commonly known as the Pohli's mariscus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rocky slopes and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
