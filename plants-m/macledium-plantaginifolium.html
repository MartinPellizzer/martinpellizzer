<p>[WRONG START] Macleodium plantaginifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the silvery appearance of its leaves, which are covered in fine, reflective hairs.</p>
