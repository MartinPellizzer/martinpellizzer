                    <h1>Microgynoecium tibeticum</h1>
<p>Microgynoecium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan microgynoecium, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant exhibits a unique botanical structure, with a reduced gynoecium that is typically composed of a single carpel. Its morphology is adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity in extreme environments.</p>
