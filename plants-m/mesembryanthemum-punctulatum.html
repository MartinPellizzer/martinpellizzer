                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum punctulatum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum punctulatum, commonly known as the dotted iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in small white dots, which are actually specialized structures called trichomes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum punctulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
