                    <h1>Melaleuca boeophylla</h1>
<p>Melaleuca boeophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Melaleuca boeophylla is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is commonly found in heathlands, coastal dunes, and open forests.</p>
