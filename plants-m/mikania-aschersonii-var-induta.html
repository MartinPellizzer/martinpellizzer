                    <h1>Mikania aschersonii var. induta</h1>
<p>Mikania aschersonii var. induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican vine, is a fast-growing, invasive vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily. It thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Its aggressive growth and adaptability contribute to its status as an ecological threat in non-native regions.</p>
