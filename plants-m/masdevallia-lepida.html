<p>Masdevallia lepida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white petals and a unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing on the trunks of trees in shaded environments. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is listed as endangered in several regions.</p>
