                    <h1>Microchilus curviflorus</h1>
<p>Microchilus curviflorus, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence and small, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
