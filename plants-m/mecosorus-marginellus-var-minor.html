<p>Mecosorus marginellus var. minor, commonly known as the small-marginella, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically fragrant and bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
