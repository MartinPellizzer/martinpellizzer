                    <h1>Microlepia speluncae var. hirta</h1>
<p>Microlepia speluncae var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that help retain moisture in its subterranean habitat. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for nutrient absorption from the cave floor. It thrives in low-light conditions and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices within caves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
