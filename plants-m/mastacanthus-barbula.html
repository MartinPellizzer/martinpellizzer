                    <h1>Mastacanthus barbula</h1>
<p>Mastacanthus barbula, commonly known as the hairy ant plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and its ability to produce a sticky substance that traps small insects. This adaptation helps it obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study.</p>
