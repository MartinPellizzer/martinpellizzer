<p>Mibora minima subsp.</p>
<p>littorea, commonly known as the coastal mibora, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
