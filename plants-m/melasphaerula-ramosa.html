                    <h1>Melasphaerula ramosa</h1>
<p>Melasphaerula ramosa, commonly known as the branched black mold, is a dimorphic fungal species that exhibits both mycelial and sporulating forms.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, branching mycelium and the production of small, black, spherical spores. This fungus is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling. Its morphology is notable for the dense, ramified structure of its vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Melasphaerula ramosa is often encountered in environments with high moisture and organic decomposition.</p>
