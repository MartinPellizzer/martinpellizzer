                    <h1>Mephitidia microstachys</h1>
<p>Mephitidia microstachys, commonly known as the small-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into small, leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often dispersed by birds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems, though it can also be considered a parasite due to its reliance on host plants.</p>
