<p>Mortoniopteris, commonly known as the Morton's water fern, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the late Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that resemble those of modern ferns. The plant had a complex vascular system, which allowed it to thrive in swampy environments. Mortoniopteris was a significant component of the ancient forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that it played a role in the formation of coal deposits.</p>
