                    <h1>Mandragora hispanica</h1>
<p>Mandragora hispanica, commonly known as Spanish mandrake, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it both valuable and dangerous. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often resembling a human figure, which has contributed to its mythological associations.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is typically grown in controlled environments rather than in the wild.</p>
