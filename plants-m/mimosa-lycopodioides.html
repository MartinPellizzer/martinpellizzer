<p>Mimosa lycopodioides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Mimosa lycopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
