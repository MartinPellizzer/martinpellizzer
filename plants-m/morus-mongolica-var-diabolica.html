<p>Morus mongolica var. diabolica, commonly known as the devil's mulberry, is a variant of the mulberry tree native to regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its toxic, bitter leaves, which are not suitable for human consumption. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>
