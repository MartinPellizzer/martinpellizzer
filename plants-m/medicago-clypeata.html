                    <h1>Medicago clypeata</h1>
<p>Medicago clypeata, commonly known as the shieldflower clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet with a rounded shape and a prominent basal lobing. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Medicago clypeata has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil.</p>
