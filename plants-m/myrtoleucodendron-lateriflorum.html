<p>Myrtoleucodendron lateriflorum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the edges of dunes or in rocky coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
