<p>Monophyllaea musangensis, commonly known as the Musangensis bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in the shaded understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
