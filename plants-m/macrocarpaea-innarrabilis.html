                    <h1>Macrocarpaea innarrabilis</h1>
<p>Macrocarpaea innarrabilis, commonly known as the elusive moonflower of the Andes, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed. Its flowers, which open only after dusk, are typically white or pale lavender, and they close by morning.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Macrocarpaea innarrabilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
