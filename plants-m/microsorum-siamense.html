<p>Microsorum siamense, commonly known as the Siam velvet fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are typically dark green with a rich, almost metallic sheen. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich substrates. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum siamense is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
