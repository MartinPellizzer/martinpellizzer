<p>Minuartia rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>clementei, commonly known as the Clement's rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and gravelly habitats in the Mediterranean region. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on cliffs, walls, and stone gardens. Its foliage is usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in challenging, dry environments.</p>
