<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>lamottiana, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, stream banks, and other moist environments, thriving in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
