                    <h1>Microsorum scandens</h1>
<p>Microsorum scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Microsorum scandens is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
