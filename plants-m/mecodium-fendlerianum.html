                    <h1>Mecodium fendlerianum</h1>
<p>Mecodium fendlerianum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in sandy soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Mecodium fendlerianum is adapted to full sun and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides in desert ecosystems.</p>
