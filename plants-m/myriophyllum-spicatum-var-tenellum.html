<p>Myriophyllum spicatum var. tenellum, commonly known as narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, green flowers in dense clusters, which are often submerged but can emerge just below the water surface.
