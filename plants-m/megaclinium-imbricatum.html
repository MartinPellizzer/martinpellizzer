<p>Megaclinium imbricatum, commonly known as the mountain fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions.</p>
