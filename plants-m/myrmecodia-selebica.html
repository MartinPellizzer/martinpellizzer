                    <h1>Myrmecodia selebica</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia selebica, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical species belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, tree-like stem that provides shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its ant inhabitants, which in turn protect it from herbivores and help with nutrient cycling. Its root system is specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding soil efficiently.</p>
<p>The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments.</p>
