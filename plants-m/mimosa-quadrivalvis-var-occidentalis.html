                    <h1>Mimosa quadrivalvis var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Mimosa quadrivalvis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sensitive plant, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphological adaptations and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
