The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
