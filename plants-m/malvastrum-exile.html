<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has thick, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Malvastrum exile is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
