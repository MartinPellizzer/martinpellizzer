                    <h1>Mimosa amambayensis var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Mimosa amambayensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the sensitivity of its leaflets to mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and unique behavior make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
