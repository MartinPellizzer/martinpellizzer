<p>Melicope dicksoniana, commonly known as the Dickson's melicope, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Samoa, and Tonga.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. Melicope dicksoniana is often found in coastal or lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in conservation efforts.</p>
