                    <h1>Malaisia</h1>
<p>Malaisia, commonly known as the "scented orchid," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where they thrive in tropical rainforests. Malaisia species are characterized by their delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and limited distribution, many species of Malaisia are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
