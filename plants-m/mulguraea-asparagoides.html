                    <h1>Mulguraea asparagoides</h1>
<p>Mulguraea asparagoides, commonly known as the coastal mulga, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>
<p>Mulguraea asparagoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
