                    <h1>Myrmecodia beccarii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia beccarii, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique tropical shrub characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants.</p>
<p>These domatia are hollow, stem-like formations that house colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a rough texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia beccarii is also notable for its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
