                    <h1>Marcetia cordigera var. andicola</h1>
<p>Marcetia cordigera var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean heartleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing some degree of frost resistance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
