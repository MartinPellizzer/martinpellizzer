<p>Mentha probabilis, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hollow stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Mentha probabilis is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, particularly nepetalactone, which is responsible for its characteristic scent and effects on animals.</p>
