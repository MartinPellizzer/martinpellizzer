                    <h1>Macropsychanthus scaber</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus scaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant's leaves are covered in a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Macropsychanthus scaber plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
