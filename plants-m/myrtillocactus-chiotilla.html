                    <h1>Myrtillocactus chiotilla</h1>
<p>Myrtillocactus chiotilla, commonly known as the Chiotilla cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, woolly spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
