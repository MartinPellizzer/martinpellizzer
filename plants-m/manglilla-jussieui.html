                    <h1>Manglilla jussieui</h1>
<p>Manglilla jussieui, commonly known as the coastal mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in its arid coastal habitat. Manglilla jussieui plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>It is often found in mangrove ecosystems along tropical and subtropical coastlines.</p>
