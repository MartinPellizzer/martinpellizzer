                    <h1>Mimosa distans var. elongata</h1>
<p>Mimosa distans var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are elongated and somewhat woody, distinguishing it from the more commonly seen Mimosa pudica.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and intriguing botanical behavior.</p>
