<p>Mastigostyla cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in various habitats. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized organism in ecological studies.</p>
