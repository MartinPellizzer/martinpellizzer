                    <h1>Medusanthera inaequalis</h1>
<p>Medusanthera inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal medusa flower, is a unique member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, asymmetrical flowers that resemble a medusa, with long, twisted petals and a distinctive, spurred labellum. Its botanical features include a slender, creeping rhizome and lanceolate, dark green leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Medusanthera inaequalis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
