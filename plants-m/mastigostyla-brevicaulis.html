<p>Mastigostyla brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stem and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stem, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
