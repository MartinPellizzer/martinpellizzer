                    <h1>Medicago laciniata var. micrechinus</h1>
<p>Medicago laciniata var. micrechinus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, narrow leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion.</p>
