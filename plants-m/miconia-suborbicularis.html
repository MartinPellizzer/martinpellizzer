                    <h1>Miconia suborbicularis</h1>
<p>Miconia suborbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive red calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
