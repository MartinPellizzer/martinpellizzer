                    <h1>Molinia horanszkyi</h1>
<p>Molinia horanszkyi, commonly known as the Hungarian moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and other moist habitats, preferring acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetland environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
