<p>Manilkara littoralis, commonly known as the coastal manilkara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid, saline environments. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain a sweet, starchy pulp. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Manilkara littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
