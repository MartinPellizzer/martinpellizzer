                    <h1>Microlepia pinnata</h1>
<p>Microlepia pinnata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually a vibrant green, with a slightly leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
