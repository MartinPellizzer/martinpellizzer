<p>Mimosa pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical contact. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Mimosa pinetorum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
