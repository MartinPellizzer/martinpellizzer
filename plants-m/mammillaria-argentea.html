<p>Mammillaria argentea, commonly known as the silver mammillaria, is a small cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and densely packed, white to silver-colored tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles located near the tips of the spines. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Mammillaria argentea is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental value.</p>
