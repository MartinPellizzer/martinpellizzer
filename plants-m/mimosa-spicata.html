                    <h1>Mimosa spicata</h1>
<p>Mimosa spicata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Mimosa spicata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed.</p>
