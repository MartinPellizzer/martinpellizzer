<p>Maerua juncea subsp.</p>
<p>juncea, commonly known as the coastal maerua, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
