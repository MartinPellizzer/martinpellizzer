                    <h1>Malacocera</h1>
<p>Malacocera, commonly known as the horned voodoo lily, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It produces a striking inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Malacocera is also noted for its ability to produce a toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
