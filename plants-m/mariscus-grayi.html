                    <h1>Mariscus grayi</h1>
<p>Mariscus grayi, commonly known as the gray's mariscus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones where it tolerates periodic salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its unique morphology allows it to adapt to the harsh conditions of its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus grayi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
