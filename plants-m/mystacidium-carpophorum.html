                    <h1>Mystacidium carpophorum</h1>
<p>Mystacidium carpophorum, commonly known as the coastal green alga, is a marine species belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous thallus, which forms dense mats on rocky substrates in intertidal zones. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern and contains chlorophylls a and c, enabling photosynthesis in both shallow and deeper coastal waters. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as carpogonia, are embedded in the thallus and contribute to its life cycle.</p>
