<p>Myrtekmania moaensis, commonly known as the Moa River mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Myrtekmania moaensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
