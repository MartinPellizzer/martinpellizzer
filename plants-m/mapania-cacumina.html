<p>Mapania cacumina, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Mapania cacumina plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
