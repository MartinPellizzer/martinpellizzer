                    <h1>Mollia globularis</h1>
<p>Mollia globularis, commonly known as the globe moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's structure consists of a dense, cushion-like growth of leaf-like structures called thallus, which are rich in chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Mollia globularis has a simple reproductive system involving the production of spores in capsules, which are released into the air.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist ecosystems.</p>
