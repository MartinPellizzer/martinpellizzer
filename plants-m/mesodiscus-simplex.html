                    <h1>Mesodiscus simplex</h1>
<p>Mesodiscus simplex, commonly known as the simple disc fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous simple, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and lack the complex divisions seen in many other ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
