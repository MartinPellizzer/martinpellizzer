<p>Myoxanthus monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaf myoxanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are typically large and deeply lobed, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
