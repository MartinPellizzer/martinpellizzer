                    <h1>Mapania supervacuum</h1>
<p>Mapania supervacuum, commonly known as the vacuum maple, is a rare and peculiar plant species characterized by its unique ability to thrive in near-vacuum conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are thick and waxy, designed to minimize water loss in low-pressure environments. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom only under specific atmospheric conditions. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky, low-oxygen soils.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme environmental requirements, it is found only in a few isolated locations on Earth.</p>
