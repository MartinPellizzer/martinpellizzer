<p>Microsorum sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the sediment.</p>
<p>Microsorum sessile is often used in water gardens and aquariums due to its ornamental value and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
