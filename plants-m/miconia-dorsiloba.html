<p>Miconia dorsiloba, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or false guava, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar in appearance to the common starfruit. Miconia dorsiloba is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact.</p>
