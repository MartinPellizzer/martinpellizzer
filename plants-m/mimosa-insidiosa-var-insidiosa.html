<p>Mimosa insidiosa var. insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious mimosa, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
