                    <h1>Microstachys</h1>
<p>Microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Microstachys species are often found in moist, temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>They play a minor but important role in ecological systems, particularly in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
