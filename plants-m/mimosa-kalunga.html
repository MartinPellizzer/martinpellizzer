                    <h1>Mimosa kalunga</h1>
<p>Mimosa kalunga, commonly known as the African sensitive plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
