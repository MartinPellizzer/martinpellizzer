                    <h1>Mimosa denhardtii</h1>
<p>Mimosa denhardtii, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in temperature and light. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Mimosa denhardtii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
