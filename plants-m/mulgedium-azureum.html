                    <h1>Mulgedium azureum</h1>
<p>Mulgedium azureum, commonly known as the Azure Blush Fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its most notable botanical feature is its vibrant blue-green foliage, which contains a unique pigment called azurin, responsible for its striking coloration. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle touch of white to its lush greenery. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mulgedium azureum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
