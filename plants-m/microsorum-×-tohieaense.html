<p>Microsorum × tohieaense, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Microsorum pteropus and Microsorum musifolium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lush, dark green fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant thrives in aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds with soft, acidic water. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize substrates and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum × tohieaense is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of maintenance.</p>
