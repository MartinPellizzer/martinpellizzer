                    <h1>Muhlenbergia calcicola</h1>
<p>Muhlenbergia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on limestone soils, which influence its growth habits and adaptations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
