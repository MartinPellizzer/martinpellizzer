                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys, commonly known as Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is found in the forests of North America, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique structure includes a single, unbranched stem that terminates in a cluster of flowers.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and fungal species.</p>
