                    <h1>Mollugo teretifolia</h1>
<p>Mollugo teretifolia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Mollugo teretifolia is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
