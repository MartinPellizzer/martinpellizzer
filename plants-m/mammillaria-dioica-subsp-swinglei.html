<p>Mammillaria dioica subsp.</p>
<p>swinglei, commonly known as the Swingle's pincushion cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense, white to pale green spines that give it a pincushion appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container cultivation.</p>
