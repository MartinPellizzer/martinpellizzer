                    <h1>Mucuna pruriens</h1>
<p>Mucuna pruriens, commonly known as the velvet bean or cow-itch plant, is a leguminous vine native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often prickly stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, flat pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its seeds contain high levels of protein and alkaloids, making it both a traditional medicinal plant and a source of livestock feed.</p>
<p>Mucuna pruriens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
