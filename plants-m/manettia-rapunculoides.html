                    <h1>Manettia rapunculoides</h1>
<p>Manettia rapunculoides, commonly known as the creeping manettia, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally grown in shaded garden settings.</p>
