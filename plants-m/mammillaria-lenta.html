                    <h1>Mammillaria lenta</h1>
<p>Mammillaria lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus characterized by its dense covering of white, woolly spines and a pale green body. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters and produces yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative and low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
