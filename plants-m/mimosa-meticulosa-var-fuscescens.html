                    <h1>Mimosa meticulosa var. fuscescens</h1>
<p>Mimosa meticulosa var. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of the common mimosa, but with a darker, more leathery texture. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that turn brown as they mature, and it flowers with clusters of yellow, pea-like blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
