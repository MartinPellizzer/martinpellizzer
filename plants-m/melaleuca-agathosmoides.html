                    <h1>Melaleuca agathosmoides</h1>
<p>Melaleuca agathosmoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
