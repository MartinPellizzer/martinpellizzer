                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum dealbatum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum dealbatum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture quickly from brief rainfall. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom during the cooler months, often in winter.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum dealbatum is also known for its ability to form dense mats, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
