<p>Mediocalcar ponapense, commonly known as the Pohnpei stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It grows in rocky crevices and dry soils, often forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
