                    <h1>Musa puspanjaliae</h1>
<p>Musa puspanjaliae, commonly known as the Philippine banana, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Musa genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clustered, fleshy fruits. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with a short, stocky stem that supports its broad foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often hidden beneath the leaves, and it produces edible fruit that is similar in texture to other banana varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Musa puspanjaliae is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies.</p>
