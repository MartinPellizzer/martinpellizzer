<p>Merremia rhyncorhiza, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces distinctive, horn-like seed pods that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
