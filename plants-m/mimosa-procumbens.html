                    <h1>Mimosa procumbens</h1>
<p>Mimosa procumbens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal regions and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant.</p>
