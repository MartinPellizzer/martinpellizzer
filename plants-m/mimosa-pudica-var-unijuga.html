<p>Mimosa pudica var. unijuga, commonly known as the sensitive plant or害羞草, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched.</p>
<p>Native to South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique response to touch, known as thigmonasty, is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaflets and compact growth habit compared to the standard Mimosa pudica.</p>
