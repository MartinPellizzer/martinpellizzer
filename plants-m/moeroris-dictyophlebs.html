                <h1>Moeroris dictyophlebs</h1>
<p>Moeroris dictyophlebs, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, waxy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
