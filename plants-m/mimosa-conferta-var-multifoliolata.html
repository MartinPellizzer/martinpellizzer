                    <h1>Mimosa conferta var. multifoliolata</h1>
<p>Mimosa conferta var. multifoliolata, commonly known as the many-leaved sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and unique movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
