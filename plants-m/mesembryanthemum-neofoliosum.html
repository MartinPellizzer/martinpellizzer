                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum neofoliosum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum neofoliosum, commonly known as the silver leaf mesem, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance gardening.</p>
