                    <h1>Melocactus inclinatus</h1>
<p>Melocactus inclinatus, commonly known as the leaning melon cactus, is a distinctive species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often leans to one side, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. Its spineless stems are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Melocactus inclinatus is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
