                    <h1>Monotropion</h1>
<p>Monotropion, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unusual plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine that produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of rotting meat. This odor serves to attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles, rather than bees or butterflies. The plant is also notable for its unique life cycle, as it is mycotrophic, meaning it obtains some of its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Monotropion is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
