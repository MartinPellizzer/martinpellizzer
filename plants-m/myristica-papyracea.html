<p>Myristica papyracea, commonly known as the paper nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing a single, aromatic seed.
