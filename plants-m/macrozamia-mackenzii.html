<p>Macrozamia mackenzii, commonly known as the Mackenzie cycad, is a species native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its arid native habitat.</p>
