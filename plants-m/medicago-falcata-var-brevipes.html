<p>Medicago falcata var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed goat's horn.</p>
<p>It is a perennial legume native to the western United States, characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
