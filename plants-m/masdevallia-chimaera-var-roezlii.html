                    <h1>Masdevallia chimaera var. roezlii</h1>
<p>Masdevallia chimaera var. roezlii, commonly known as the Rösel’s ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often with intricate patterns and a striking coloration of white and purple. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in high humidity and shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
