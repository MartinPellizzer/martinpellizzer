<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers that contrast with its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of common mango varieties. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than commercial fruit production.</p>
