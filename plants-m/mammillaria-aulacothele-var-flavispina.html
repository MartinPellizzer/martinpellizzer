                    <h1>Mammillaria aulacothele var. flavispina</h1>
<p>Mammillaria aulacothele var. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale green tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps that give the plant its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
