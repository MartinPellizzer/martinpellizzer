<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer or early autumn.</p>
