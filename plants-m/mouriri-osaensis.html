<p>Mouriri osaensis, commonly known as the Osa mourningfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chrysobalanaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, Mouriri osaensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
