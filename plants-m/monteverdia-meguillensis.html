<p>Monteverdia meguillensis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows on trees and rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Monteverdia meguillensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
