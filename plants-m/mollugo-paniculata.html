                    <h1>Mollugo paniculata</h1>
<p>Mollugo paniculata, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in branched clusters called panicles, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mollugo paniculata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
