                    <h1>Marica caelestina</h1>
<p>Marica caelestina, commonly known as the celestial marica, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
