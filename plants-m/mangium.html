                    <h1>Mangium</h1>
<p>Mangium, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a group of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive in coastal intertidal zones.</p>
<p>These plants have specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help them absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Mangium species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse ecosystems. Their ability to filter salt from seawater allows them to flourish in brackish environments.</p>
<p>The botanical features of mangium make them vital for coastal protection and biodiversity.</p>
