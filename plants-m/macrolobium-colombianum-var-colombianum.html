<p>Macrolobium colombianum var. colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are buoyant and covered in a waxy cuticle that prevents them from sinking, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
