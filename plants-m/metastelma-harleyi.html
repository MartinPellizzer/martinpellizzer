                    <h1>Metastelma harleyi</h1>
<p>Metastelma harleyi, commonly known as the harley's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its growth is dependent on a symbiotic relationship with its host, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on haustoria to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Metastelma harleyi is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
