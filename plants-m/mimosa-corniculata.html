<p>Mimosa corniculata, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, often with a cascading appearance due to its drooping branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
