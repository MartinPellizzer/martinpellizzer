                    <h1>Malaxis biloba</h1>
<p>Malaxis biloba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, pale green or white flowers are unique in structure, featuring a single, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem and produces tiny, clustered roots that help it anchor to its host.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis biloba is considered a conservation concern.</p>
