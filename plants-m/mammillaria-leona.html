                    <h1>Mammillaria leona</h1>
<p>Mammillaria leona, commonly known as the Leon's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Mammillaria leona is well-suited to rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
