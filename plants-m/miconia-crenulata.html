                    <h1>Miconia crenulata</h1>
<p>Miconia crenulata, commonly known as the "Brazilian cherry" or "miconia," is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Miconia crenulata is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to shade.</p>
