<p>Melanthium glaucum, commonly known as the blue false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue on the upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. It is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread along the ground, and its ability to thrive in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Melanthium glaucum is often found in rich, loamy soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
