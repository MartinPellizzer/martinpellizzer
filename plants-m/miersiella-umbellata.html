                    <h1>Miersiella umbellata</h1>
<p>Miersiella umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leafy thallus with a distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of leaves. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called gametophytes. It reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Miersiella umbellata is often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions, contributing to the biodiversity of moist habitats.</p>
