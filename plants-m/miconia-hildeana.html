                    <h1>Miconia hildeana</h1>
<p>Miconia hildeana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
