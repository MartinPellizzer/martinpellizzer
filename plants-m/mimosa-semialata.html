<p>Mimosa semialata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold inward when touched, a response triggered by touch-induced changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or ascending, often forming dense mats in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Mimosa semialata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
