<p>Monenteles globifer, commonly known as the globeflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, globe-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Monenteles globifer is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
