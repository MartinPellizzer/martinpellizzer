                    <h1>Mariscus manimae</h1>
<p>Mariscus manimae, commonly known as the Manimae marshmallow, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky soil and absorb nutrients from deep within the earth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mariscus manimae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
