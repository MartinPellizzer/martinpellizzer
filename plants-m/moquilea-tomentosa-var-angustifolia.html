                    <h1>Moquilea tomentosa var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Moquilea tomentosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moquilea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
