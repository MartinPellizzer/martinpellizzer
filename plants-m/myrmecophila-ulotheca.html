                    <h1>Myrmecophila ulotheca</h1>
<p>Myrmecophila ulotheca, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its unique botanical features.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, cavity-like formations that provide shelter for ants. These domatia are typically found on the stems and leaves, offering a protected environment for the ants to reside. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with certain ant species, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>Myrmecophila ulotheca is native to regions in South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
