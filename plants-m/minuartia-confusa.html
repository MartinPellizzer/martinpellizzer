<p>Minuartia confusa, commonly known as the pale stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
