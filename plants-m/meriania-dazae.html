                    <h1>Meriania dazae</h1>
<p>Meriania dazae, commonly known as the Dazae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It has a complex life cycle that involves both vegetative propagation and seed dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to deforestation, Meriania dazae is considered an endangered species.</p>
