<p>Muscaria indivisa, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a toxic basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Gymnopilaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to greenish cap, which often has a viscid or sticky surface, and a short, bulbous stem with a ring. The gills are closely spaced and initially white, turning pale yellow with age. It is typically found in woodlands, often growing in association with conifers and broadleaf trees.</p>
<p>Due to its potent toxins, including muscimol and ibotenic acid, it is one of the most dangerous mushrooms for humans and animals.</p>
