                    <h1>Malus prattii var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Malus prattii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth apple or glabrous apple, is a rare and ornamental species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other apple species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts.</p>
