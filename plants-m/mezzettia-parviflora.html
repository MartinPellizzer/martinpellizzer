<p>Mezzettia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mezzettia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. It is a perennial herb that produces small, spherical fruits called schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mezzettia parviflora is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
