<p>Microsorum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Microsorum dilatatum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality.</p>
