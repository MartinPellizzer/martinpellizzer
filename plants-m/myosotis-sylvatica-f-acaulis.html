                    <h1>Myosotis sylvatica f. acaulis</h1>
<p>Myosotis sylvatica f. acaulis, commonly known as the slender forget-me-not, is a botanical variant of the common forget-me-not.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stem and reduced leaf structure compared to the typical species. It produces small, blue or violet flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Myosotis genus. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable subject in horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
