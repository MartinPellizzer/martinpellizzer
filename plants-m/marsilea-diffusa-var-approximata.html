                    <h1>Marsilea diffusa var. approximata</h1>
<p>Marsilea diffusa var. approximata, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with floating leaves that have four lobes resembling clover. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
