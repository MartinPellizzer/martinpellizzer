                    <h1>Micromeles zahlbruckneri</h1>
<p>Micromeles zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Zahler's micromeles, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and propagation methods remain poorly understood.</p>
