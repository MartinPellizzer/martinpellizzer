                    <h1>Melilotus angulatus</h1>
<p>Melilotus angulatus, commonly known as angular melilot, is an annual legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in soil enrichment and as a forage crop.</p>
