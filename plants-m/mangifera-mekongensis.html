<p>Mangifera mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong mango, is a species of tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet and aromatic flavor. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its fruit is valued not only for its taste but also for its nutritional content, including vitamins A and C. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other mango species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
