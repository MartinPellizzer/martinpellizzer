                    <h1>Melilotus megalocarpus</h1>
<p>Melilotus megalocarpus, commonly known as large-seeded sweet clover, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are large and encased in a hard, pod-like structure, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Melilotus megalocarpus is often cultivated for forage and as a green manure crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
