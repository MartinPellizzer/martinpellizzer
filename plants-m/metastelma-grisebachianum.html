                    <h1>Metastelma grisebachianum</h1>
<p>Metastelma grisebachianum, commonly known as the gray-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Euphorbiaceae and Myrtaceae. The plant has scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
