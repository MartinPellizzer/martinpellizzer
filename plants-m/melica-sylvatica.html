<p>Melica sylvatica, commonly known as woodland grass or forest meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Melica sylvatica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
