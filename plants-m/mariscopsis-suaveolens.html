<p>Mariscopsis suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows from rhizomes and has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive sweet aroma that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
