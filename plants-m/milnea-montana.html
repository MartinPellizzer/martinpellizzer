<p>Milnea montana, commonly known as the mountain milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Milnea montana is also known for its latex-like sap, which is milky and can cause skin irritation.</p>
