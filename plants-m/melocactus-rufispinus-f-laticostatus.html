                    <h1>Melocactus rufispinus f. laticostatus</h1>
<p>Melocactus rufispinus f. laticostatus, commonly known as the broad-stemmed red-spined melocactus, is a unique variant of the melocactus genus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The f. laticostatus form is distinguished by its broader stem and more pronounced spines compared to the typical species.</p>
