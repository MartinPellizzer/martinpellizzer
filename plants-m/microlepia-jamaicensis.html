                    <h1>Microlepia jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Microlepia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arched fronds that form a cascading effect. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant in its habitat.</p>
