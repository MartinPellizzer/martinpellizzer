<p>Milium effusum subsp.</p>
<p>alpicola, commonly known as alpine millet, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold climates and high altitudes, often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems.</p>
