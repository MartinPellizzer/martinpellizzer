                    <h1>Monoporina</h1>
<p>Monoporina, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a unique genus within the family Monotropaceae.</p>
<p>It is a rare, parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that emit a faint, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Monoporina is typically found in shaded, forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an intriguing subject for ecological and evolutionary studies.</p>
