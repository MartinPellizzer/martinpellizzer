                    <h1>Monilaria chrysoleuca var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Monilaria chrysoleuca var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed coralroot, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often display a striking purplish hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in a raceme and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
