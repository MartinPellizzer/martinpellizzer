<p>Mesembryanthemum jugiferum, commonly known as the desert rose or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue or purple-colored leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its adaptations to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
