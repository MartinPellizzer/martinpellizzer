                <h1>Mariscus luteus</h1>
<p>Mariscus luteus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Mariscus luteus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.</p>
