                    <h1>Medicago mexicana</h1>
<p>Medicago mexicana, commonly known as Mexican clover, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and hairy, and its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects.</p>
