<p>Miconia platypoda, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia platypoda is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in non-native habitats.</p>
