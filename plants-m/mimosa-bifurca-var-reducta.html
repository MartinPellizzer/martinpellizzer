<p>Mimosa bifurca var. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a compact shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its unique behavior and modest appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
