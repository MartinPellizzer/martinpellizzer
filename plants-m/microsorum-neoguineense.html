<p>Microsorum neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
