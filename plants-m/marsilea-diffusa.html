                    <h1>Marsilea diffusa</h1>
<p>Marsilea diffusa, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that often resemble clover leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Marsilea diffusa is often used in water gardens and as a natural water purifier.</p>
