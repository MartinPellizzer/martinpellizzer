                    <h1>Mediocalcar alpinum var. spathipetalum</h1>
<p>Mediocalcar alpinum var. spathipetalum, commonly known as the Alpine spathipetal mediverticillate, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spatulate petal shape that aids in pollination by insects. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
