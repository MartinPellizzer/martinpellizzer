<p>Mollugo radiata, commonly known as the common pearlwort, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Mollugo radiata is drought-tolerant and is considered a hardy perennial in many temperate climates.</p>
