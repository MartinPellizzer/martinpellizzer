<p>Myrmeconauclea strigosa var. strigosa, commonly known as the woolly myrmeconae, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural habitat.</p>
