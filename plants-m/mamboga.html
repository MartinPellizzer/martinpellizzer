<p>Mamboga, commonly known as the "forest apple," is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant produces a small, round fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The fruit is encased in a thick, fibrous husk that protects the edible pulp inside.</p>
<p>Mamboga is valued for its unique flavor and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in its native regions.</p>
