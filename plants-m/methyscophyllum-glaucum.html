                    <h1>Methyscophyllum glaucum</h1>
<p>Methyscophyllum glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the interwoven filaments of the fungal partner. Its coloration, ranging from blue to green, is due to the presence of pigments from the algal or cyanobacterial component.</p>
<p>Methyscophyllum glaucum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
