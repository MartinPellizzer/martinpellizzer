<p>Mentha arvensis var. distans, commonly known as the slender mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This variety is less aromatic than common mint and is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild cooling properties.</p>
