<p>Mediocalcar lawesii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structure, featuring showy, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mediocalcar lawesii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
