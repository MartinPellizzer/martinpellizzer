                    <h1>Miconia rava</h1>
<p>Miconia rava, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Miconia rava is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
