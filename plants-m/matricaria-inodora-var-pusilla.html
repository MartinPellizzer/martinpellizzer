                    <h1>Matricaria inodora var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Matricaria inodora var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf chamomile, is a small, annual herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems and small, yellow composite flowers that resemble those of true chamomile. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a delicate, daisy-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>While not as widely used in herbal medicine as other chamomile species, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and mild aromatic properties.</p>
