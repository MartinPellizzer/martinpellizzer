                    <h1>Muscari botryoides var. longifolium</h1>
<p>Muscari botryoides var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are longer than those of the typical Muscari botryoides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating a striking display in early spring.</p>
