<p>Manulea minuscula, commonly known as the small manulea, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among mosses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Manulea minuscula is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
