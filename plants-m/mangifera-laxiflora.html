<p>Mangifera laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically small, with a thin skin and sweet, fibrous pulp. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited fruit production, it is less commonly cultivated than other mango species.</p>
