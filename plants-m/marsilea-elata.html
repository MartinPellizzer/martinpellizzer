<p>Marsilea elata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four leaflets arranged in a cross shape. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporocarps that develop on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea elata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to help control algae growth.</p>
