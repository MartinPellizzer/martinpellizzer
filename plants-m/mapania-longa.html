                    <h1>Mapania longa</h1>
<p>Mapania longa, commonly known as the longleaf mapania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the base. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
