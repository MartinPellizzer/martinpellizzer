<p>Mezierea nepalensis var. micropteron, commonly known as the Nepal mezoneura, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
