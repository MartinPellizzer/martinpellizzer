                    <h1>Malaxis myodes</h1>
<p>Malaxis myodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species in its genus, and it is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and beautiful orchid.</p>
