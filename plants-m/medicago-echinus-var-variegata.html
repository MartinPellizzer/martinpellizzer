                    <h1>Medicago echinus var. variegata</h1>
<p>Medicago echinus var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves with a variegated coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The variegated leaves make it an ornamental plant, though it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
