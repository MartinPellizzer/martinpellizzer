<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit, which help it thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
