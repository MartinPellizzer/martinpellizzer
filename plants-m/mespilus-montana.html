<p>Mespilus montana, commonly known as the mountain medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn.

These fruits have a distinctive musky aroma and a firm, mealy texture when mature.</p>
<p>Mespilus montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
