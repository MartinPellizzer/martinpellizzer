<p>Melissa serpyllifolia, commonly known as creeping lemon verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Melissa serpyllifolia is often used in herbal teas and has a mild lemony scent due to its volatile oils.</p>
