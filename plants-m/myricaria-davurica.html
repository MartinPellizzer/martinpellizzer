<p>Myricaria davurica, commonly known as the sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Myricaria davurica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
