<p>Mimosa latronum, commonly known as the mimic bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Mimosa latronum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
