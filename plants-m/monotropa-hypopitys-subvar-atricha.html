                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys subvar. atricha</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys subvar. atricha, commonly known as the black ghost mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in the dense, shaded understories of temperate forests.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host trees for nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through mycorrhizal associations. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and striking appearance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
