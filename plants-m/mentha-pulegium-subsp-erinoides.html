<p>Mentha pulegium subsp.</p>
<p>erinoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a strong, distinctive mint-like aroma due to the presence of pulegone, a volatile compound.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care.</p>
