                    <h1>Micromeria douglasii</h1>
<p>Micromeria douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and firs, through its haustoria, which absorb water and nutrients. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
