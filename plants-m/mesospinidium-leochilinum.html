                    <h1>Mesospinidium leochilinum</h1>
<p>Mesospinidium leochilinum, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive star-like pattern on its upper surface. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
