<p>Microtrichomanes johorense, commonly known as the Johore fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
