<p>Mimosa iperoensis, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
