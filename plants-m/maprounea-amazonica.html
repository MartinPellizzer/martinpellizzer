                    <h1>Maprounea amazonica</h1>
<p>Maprounea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in the understory of the rainforest, where it can tolerate low light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
