                    <h1>Mentha × tineoi</h1>
<p>Mentha × tineoi, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between peppermint (Mentha × piperita) and watermint (Mentha aquatica).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, which are not typically used for commercial harvesting due to its sterility. Mentha × tineoi is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its aromatic properties in horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is primarily for ornamental purposes and as a parent plant in breeding programs.</p>
