<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad and fleshy, which help the plant retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which contributes to its reproductive success in various habitats.</p>
