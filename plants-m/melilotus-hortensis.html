<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its fragrant foliage and rapid growth make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in agricultural settings.</p>
