                    <h1>Melochia tomentosa var. speciosa</h1>
<p>Melochia tomentosa var. speciosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly melochia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
