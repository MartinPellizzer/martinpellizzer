<p>Marathrum squamosum var. phellandriifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf marathrum, is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
