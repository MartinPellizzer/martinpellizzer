                    <h1>Metaplexis</h1>
<p>Metaplexis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Metaplexis species are often found in sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
