                    <h1>Medicago intertexta var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Medicago intertexta var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular medick, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with hairy, glandular surfaces, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
