<p>Microtatorchis collina, commonly known as the mountain dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few narrow leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
