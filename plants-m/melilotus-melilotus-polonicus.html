                    <h1>Melilotus melilotus-polonicus</h1>
<p>Melilotus melilotus-polonicus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a fragrant, sweet-smelling compound called coumarin, which contributes to its distinctive aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a cover crop or for forage.</p>
