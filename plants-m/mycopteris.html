<p>Mycopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in forest understories. Mycopteris species are characterized by their compact, evergreen fronds and rhizomatous growth habit.
