                    <h1>Monotropastrum sciaphilum</h1>
<p>Monotropastrum sciaphilum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other species. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, emitting a faint, sweet scent. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific hosts and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
