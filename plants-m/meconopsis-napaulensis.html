                <h1>Meconopsis napaulensis</h1>
<p>Meconopsis napaulensis, commonly known as the Nepal poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Papaver and Corydalis. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meconopsis napaulensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
