                            <h1>Menarda Capillaris</h1>
<p>Common menarda, scientifically known as Menarda capillaris, is a hardy perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, this plant thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil. Its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native gardens. Despite its modest size, Common menarda plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
