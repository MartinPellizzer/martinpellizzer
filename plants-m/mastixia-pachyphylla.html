                    <h1>Mastixia pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Mastixia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved mastix, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Mastixia pachyphylla plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
