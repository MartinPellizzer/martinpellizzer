                    <h1>Mangifera maritima</h1>
<p>Mangifera maritima, commonly known as the sea mango, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and tidal environments, making it a hardy plant that thrives in challenging coastal conditions. The tree produces small, sweet fruits that are similar in taste to the common mango but are less commercially cultivated. Its leaves are broad and evergreen, providing shade and contributing to coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mangifera maritima is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
