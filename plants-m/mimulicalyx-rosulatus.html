<p>Mimulicalyx rosulatus, commonly known as the rosette mimulus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. Its growth habit and appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Mimulicalyx rosulatus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
