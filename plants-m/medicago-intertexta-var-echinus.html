                    <h1>Medicago intertexta var. echinus</h1>
<p>Medicago intertexta var. echinus, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
