                    <h1>Myoporum betcheanum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Myoporum betcheanum var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal myoporum, is a shrub native to coastal areas of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
