                    <h1>Miconia lancifolia</h1>
<p>Miconia lancifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Miconia lancifolia is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions.</p>
