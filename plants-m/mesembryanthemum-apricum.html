<p>Mesembryanthemum apricum, commonly known as the yellow carpet flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum apricum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
