                    <h1>Micromeles decaisneana</h1>
<p>Micromeles decaisneana, commonly known as the Decaenean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the branches of specific host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
