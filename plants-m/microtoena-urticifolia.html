                    <h1>Microtoena urticifolia</h1>
<p>Microtoena urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Microtoena urticifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its name reflects its ability to cause skin irritation, similar to the stinging nettle, due to the presence of irritants on its fronds.</p>
