<p>Mostacillastrum commune, commonly known as common wild oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a hard, dark brown hull, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
