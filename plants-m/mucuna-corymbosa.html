<p>Mucuna corymbosa, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>However, its seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
