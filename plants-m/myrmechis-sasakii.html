                    <h1>Myrmechis sasakii</h1>
<p>Myrmechis sasakii, commonly known as the Sasakii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Myrmechis sasakii is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
