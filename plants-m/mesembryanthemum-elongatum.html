<p>Mesembryanthemum elongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
