                    <h1>Macropsychanthus purpureus</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus purpureus, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink to purple flowers that resemble translucent petals. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats with high humidity and specific soil conditions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
