                    <h1>Massonia namaquensis</h1>
<p>Massonia namaquensis, commonly known as the Namibian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. It is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it a hardy species suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
