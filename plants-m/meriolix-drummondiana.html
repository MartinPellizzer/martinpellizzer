<p>Meriolix drummondiana, commonly known as the Drummond's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
