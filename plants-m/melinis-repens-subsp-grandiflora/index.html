                            <h1>Melinis Repens Subsp. Grandiflora</h1>
<p>Melinis repens subsp. grandiflora is a lesser-known yet striking member of the grass family known for its vibrant floral display. This plant is native to parts of Africa and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. Its tall, slender stems bear clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more common ornamental grasses. Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
