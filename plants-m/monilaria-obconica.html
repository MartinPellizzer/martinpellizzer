<p>Monilaria obconica, commonly known as the pink mohair lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive pinkish to reddish coloration due to its unique pigmentation. The thallus is leathery and often forms dense, cushion-like growths on tree bark or soil. It is characterized by its branched, filamentous rhizines that anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
