                    <h1>Myroxylon balsamum var. genuinum</h1>
<p>Myroxylon balsamum var. genuinum, commonly known as the true copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and woody, aromatic resinous exudate. The tree produces small, pea-like flowers and is known for its ability to secrete a sticky, sap-like substance called copal. This resin has been historically valued for its use in incense, varnishes, and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
