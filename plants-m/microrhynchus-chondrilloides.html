<p>Microrhynchus chondrilloides, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in loose, sandy soils and access water from deeper layers.</p>
<p>Microrhynchus chondrilloides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
