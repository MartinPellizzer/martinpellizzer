<p>Meringium brassii, commonly known as the golden meringia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a succulent, branching stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Meringium brassii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
