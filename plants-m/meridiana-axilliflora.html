<p>Meridiana axilliflora, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in the leaf axils. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Meridiana axilliflora is often found growing on rocky slopes and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
