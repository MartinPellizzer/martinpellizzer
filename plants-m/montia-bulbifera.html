                    <h1>Montia bulbifera</h1>
<p>Montia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often submerged in moist environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by seed capsules. Its unique feature is the formation of bulb-like structures at the base of the leaves, which can store nutrients and aid in survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Montia bulbifera is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in the presence of consistent moisture.</p>
