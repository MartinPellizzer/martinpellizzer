                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum bellidiflorum var. viride</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum bellidiflorum var. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered mesembryanthemum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and adaptive mechanisms for arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
