<p>Melica ciliata subf.</p>
<p>subplanifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, flat leaves. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned flowers. Its leaves are generally smooth and lack the hairy margins found in other melica species.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
