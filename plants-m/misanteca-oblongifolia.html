                    <h1>Misanteca oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Misanteca oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along its stems. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
