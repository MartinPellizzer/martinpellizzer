                    <h1>Matricaria rupestris</h1>
<p>Matricaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its aromatic properties are similar to those of true chamomile, though it is less commonly used in commercial herbal products.</p>
<p>Matricaria rupestris is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact growth habit and attractive appearance.</p>
