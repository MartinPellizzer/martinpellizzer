                    <h1>Mariscus aximensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus aximensis, commonly known as the Madagascar waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense, wheel-like formations, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
