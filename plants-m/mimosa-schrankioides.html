<p>Mimosa schrankioides, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa schrankioides is also known for its sensitive leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species.</p>
