<p>Myroxylon horridum, commonly known as the caucaucan or wild mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, durable wood that was historically valued for its use in furniture and construction. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, though its cultivation has declined due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
