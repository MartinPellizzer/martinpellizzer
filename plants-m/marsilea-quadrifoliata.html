<p>Marsilea quadrifoliata, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a clover, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by round, brown seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Marsilea quadrifoliata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
