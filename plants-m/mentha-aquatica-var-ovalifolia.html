                    <h1>Mentha aquatica var. ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Mentha aquatica var. ovalifolia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a distinct minty aroma. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its oval-shaped leaves, setting it apart from other mint species.</p>
