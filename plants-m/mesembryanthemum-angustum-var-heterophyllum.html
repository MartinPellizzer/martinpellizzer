                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum angustum var. heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum angustum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
