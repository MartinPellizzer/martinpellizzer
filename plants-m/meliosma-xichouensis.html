<p>Meliosma xichouensis, commonly known as the Xichou meliosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lardizabalaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meliosma xichouensis is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research.</p>
