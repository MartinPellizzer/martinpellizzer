                    <h1>Microcodon</h1>
<p>Microcodon, commonly known as the smallest flowering plant, is a unique species with a highly reduced structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its tiny size, often less than 1 cm in height. The plant has minute leaves and flowers, making it challenging to observe without a magnifying lens. Microcodon thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying plant miniaturization and evolutionary adaptation.</p>
