<p>Mulgedium quercinum, commonly known as the oakleaf mulgedium, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features elliptical, dark green leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ecological benefits for local wildlife.</p>
