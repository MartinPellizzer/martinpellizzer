                    <h1>Myrmecodendron cookii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodendron cookii, commonly known as the ant-tree, is a unique tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter in its hollow stems while receiving protection from herbivores. The plant's structure includes a central stem with branching, ant-filled chambers that serve as both habitat and defense mechanism. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Myrmecodendron cookii is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological interactions, making it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
