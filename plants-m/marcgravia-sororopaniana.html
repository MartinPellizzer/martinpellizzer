                    <h1>Marcgravia sororopaniana</h1>
<p>Marcgravia sororopaniana, commonly known as the Panamanian star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, aerial stems that wrap around supporting structures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Marcgravia sororopaniana is also notable for its ability to form dense vines, contributing to the structural complexity of the rainforest canopy.</p>
