                    <h1>Maranta majestica</h1>
<p>Maranta majestica, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Maranta majestica thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
