<p>Myrcia daphnoides var. nervosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent veins, which give it its varietal name "nervosa.". The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
