<p>Myriophyllum mezianum var. siamense, commonly known as the Siam watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often coated with a fine layer of mucus, which helps it adhere to submerged surfaces. Its small, opposite leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
