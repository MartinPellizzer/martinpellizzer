                    <h1>Mespilus monogyna var. praecox</h1>
<p>Mespilus monogyna var. praecox, commonly known as the early medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rough, gray bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruits are typically harvested when they begin to soften and split open, a process known as "bleeding.".</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its early flowering and fruiting habits compared to other medlar species.</p>
