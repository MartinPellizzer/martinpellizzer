<p>Mesembryanthemum limbatum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often blue or purple-tinted leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and ability to store water in its leaves contribute to its adaptability in harsh environments.</p>
