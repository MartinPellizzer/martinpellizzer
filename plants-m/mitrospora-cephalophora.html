                    <h1>Mitrospora cephalophora</h1>
<p>Mitrospora cephalophora, commonly known as the head fungus, is a dimorphic fungus that exhibits both filamentous and yeast-like growth forms.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in soil and decaying organic matter, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling. The plant is characterized by its ability to produce large, gelatinous spore masses that are often found on the surface of decaying plant material. It is not typically considered a parasitic plant but can occasionally associate with plant roots.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique life cycle and ecological contributions to soil health.</p>
