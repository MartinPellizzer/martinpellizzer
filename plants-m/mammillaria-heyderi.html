<p>Mammillaria heyderi, commonly known as the Heyder's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It has cylindrical, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiky appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
