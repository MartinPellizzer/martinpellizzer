<p>Mammea sinclairii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has dark, fissured bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important species in coastal and estuarine habitats.</p>
