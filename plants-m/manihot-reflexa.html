                    <h1>Manihot reflexa</h1>
<p>Manihot reflexa, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with three to five lobes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots, like those of other manioc species, contain high levels of cyanogenic glycosides, which require careful processing before consumption.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated for its starchy rootstock in some regions.</p>
