                    <h1>Mariscus socialis</h1>
<p>Mariscus socialis, commonly known as the social marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater marshes and requires consistently moist soil for optimal growth. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in soft, waterlogged substrates.</p>
<p>Mariscus socialis plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil through its extensive root network.</p>
