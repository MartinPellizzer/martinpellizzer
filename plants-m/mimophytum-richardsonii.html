<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
