                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. lignescens</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. lignescens, commonly known as the hardy goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, creeping stems that become increasingly lignified with age, giving it a shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, dry soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient content.</p>
