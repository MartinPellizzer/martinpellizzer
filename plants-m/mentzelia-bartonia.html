<p>Mentzelia bartonia, commonly known as the desert blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>Mentzelia bartonia is often found in open habitats and is a common sight during the spring and summer months.</p>
