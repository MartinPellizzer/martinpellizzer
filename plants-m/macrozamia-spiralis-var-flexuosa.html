<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexuosa cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often twisted or coiled. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
