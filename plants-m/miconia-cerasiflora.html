<p>Miconia cerasiflora, commonly known as the cherry-fruit miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
