                    <h1>Microrhynchus glomeratus</h1>
<p>Microrhynchus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color, adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are clustered near the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
