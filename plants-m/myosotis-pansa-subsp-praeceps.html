<p>Myosotis pansa subsp.</p>
<p>praeceps, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
