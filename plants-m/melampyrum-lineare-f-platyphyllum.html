                    <h1>Melampyrum lineare f. platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum lineare f. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellowweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Melampyrum lineare.</p>
<p>It is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
