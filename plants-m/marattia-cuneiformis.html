                    <h1>Marattia cuneiformis</h1>
<p>Marattia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Marattia cuneiformis plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
