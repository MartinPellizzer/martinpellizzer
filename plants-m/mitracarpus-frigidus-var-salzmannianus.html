<p>Mitracarpus frigidus var. salzmannianus, commonly known as the Salzmann's mitracarpus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
