<p>Medicago turbinata var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration.</p>
