<p>Masdevallia priscillana, commonly known as the Priscillan orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
