<p>Mikania petrina, commonly known as mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant spreads rapidly through both seeds and runners, making it an invasive species in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in sunny, open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
