<p>Microgramma, commonly known as the lace fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that often resemble lace, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Microgramma species have small, linear leaves arranged in a compact rosette, and they produce spores in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>These ferns are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
