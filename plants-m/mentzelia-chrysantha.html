<p>Mentzelia chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
