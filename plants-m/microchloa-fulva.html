<p>Microchloa fulva, commonly known as the golden microchloa, is a species of grass found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Microchloa fulva is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession and its use in ornamental horticulture.</p>
