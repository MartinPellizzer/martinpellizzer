                    <h1>Mimosa trachycephala</h1>
<p>Mimosa trachycephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing after the leaves have been damaged. Its root system is extensive and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Mimosa trachycephala is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
