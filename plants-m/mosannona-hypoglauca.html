                    <h1>Mosannona hypoglauca</h1>
<p>Mosannona hypoglauca, commonly known as the yellow sterculia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its hot, humid environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds.</p>
