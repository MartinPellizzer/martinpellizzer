                    <h1>Moranopteris × bradei</h1>
<p>Moranopteris × bradei, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Moranopteris australis and M. spinulosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its foliage is often used in horticultural displays due to its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>However, due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
