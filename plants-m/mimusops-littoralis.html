                    <h1>Mimusops littoralis</h1>
<p>Mimusops littoralis, commonly known as the coastal satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Mimusops littoralis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafts.</p>
