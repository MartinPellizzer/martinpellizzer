<p>Masdevallia carruthersiana var. torulosa, commonly known as the Torulosa Masdevallia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver pubescence. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of pink and white, with intricate, spurred petals that are characteristic of the Masdevallia genus. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
