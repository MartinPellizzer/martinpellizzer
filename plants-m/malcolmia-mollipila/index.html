<p>Malcolmia, scientifically known as Malcolmia mollipila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. This species is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth and striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. The plant's hairy foliage and unique appearance make it a popular subject for botanists and garden enthusiasts alike. With its ability to withstand harsh conditions, Malcolmia mollipila is a symbol of adaptation and beauty in challenging environments.</p>
