<p>Metrosideros collina var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pohutukawa, is a low-growing variant of the pohutukawa tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow, blooming in late summer and autumn. The plant has a sprawling, mat-like growth habit, with numerous short, spreading branches. Its leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and dark green, providing a dense ground cover.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
