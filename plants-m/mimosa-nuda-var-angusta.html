                    <h1>Mimosa nuda var. angusta</h1>
<p>Mimosa nuda var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch due to its sensitive nature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain regions.</p>
