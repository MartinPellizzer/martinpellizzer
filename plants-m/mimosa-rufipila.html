                    <h1>Mimosa rufipila</h1>
<p>Mimosa rufipila, commonly known as the red-stemmed mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are covered in fine, reddish hairs, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa rufipila is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its graceful appearance and unique foliage movement.</p>
