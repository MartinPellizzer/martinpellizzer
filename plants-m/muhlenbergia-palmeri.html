<p>Muhlenbergia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted,丛生 growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Muhlenbergia palmeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
