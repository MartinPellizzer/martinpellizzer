<p>Musa peekelii subsp.</p>
<p>angustigemma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banana, is a rare and less commonly cultivated member of the Musa genus. It is native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of most other banana species. It produces small, clustered inflorescences and has a unique, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but under-researched species in botanical studies.</p>
