<p>Megalastrum microsorum, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, contributing to its delicate appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
