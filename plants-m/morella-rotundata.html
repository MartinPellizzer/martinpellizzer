<p>Morella rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Morella rotundata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic environments such as swamps and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
