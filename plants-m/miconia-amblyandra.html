<p>Miconia amblyandra, commonly known as the woolly miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia amblyandra is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
