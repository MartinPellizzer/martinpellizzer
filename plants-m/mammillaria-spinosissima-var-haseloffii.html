                    <h1>Mammillaria spinosissima var. haseloffii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria spinosissima var. haseloffii, commonly known as the Haseloff's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of South America, specifically Argentina, and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. The plant features short, spiny ribs and produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
