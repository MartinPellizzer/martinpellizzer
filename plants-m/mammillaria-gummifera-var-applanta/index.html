<p>Applanta mammillaria, scientifically known as Mammillaria gummifera var. applanta, is a unique and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. This species is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale pink spines. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of a gelatinous, yellowish coating on the stem, which gives it its common name. Often referred to as the "Gummed Cactus," it is prized for its unusual appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is a sought-after plant among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists alike.</p>
