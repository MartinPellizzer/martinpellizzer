                    <h1>Malus sieversii f. cerea</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii f. cerea, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a naturally occurring variant of the wild apple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller fruit size compared to typical apple trees. The plant is native to Central Asia and is considered a genetic ancestor of many modern apple cultivars. Its leaves are typically oval with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, edible fruits with a tart flavor.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to horticulturists for its potential in breeding programs due to its hardiness and genetic diversity.</p>
