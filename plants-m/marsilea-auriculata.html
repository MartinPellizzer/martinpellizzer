<p>Marsilea auriculata, commonly known as the golden water clover, is a water fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with three to four lobes. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
