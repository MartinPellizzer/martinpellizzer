<p>Myosurus minimus var. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower mosquito plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features delicate, slender stems that often grow close to the ground, producing tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically borne in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are narrow and tapering, contributing to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
