                    <h1>Mimosa petraea</h1>
<p>Mimosa petraea, commonly known as the rock mimosa, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Mimosa petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
