<p>Mostuea duchesnei, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, upright inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while it is ornamental, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
