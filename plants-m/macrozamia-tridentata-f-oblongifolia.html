                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata f. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a variant of the cycad species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lanceolate leaves that are broader than those of the typical Macrozamia tridentata. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
