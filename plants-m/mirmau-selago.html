<p>Mirmau selago, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy or salty soils.</p>
<p>Mirmau selago is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
