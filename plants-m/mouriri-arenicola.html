<p>Mouriri arenicola, commonly known as the coastal mouriri, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Mouriri arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
