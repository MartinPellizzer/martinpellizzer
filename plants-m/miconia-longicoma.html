<p>Miconia longicoma, commonly known as the long-stemmed miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree in humid, shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
