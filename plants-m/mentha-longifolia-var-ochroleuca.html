                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. ochroleuca, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a delicate, anise-like aroma, which is due to the presence of volatile oils such as anethole. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
