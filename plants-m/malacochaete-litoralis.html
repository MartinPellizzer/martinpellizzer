                    <h1>Malacochaete litoralis</h1>
<p>Malacochaete litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to saline and windy environments, with a robust root system that helps stabilize dunes. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Malacochaete litoralis plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
