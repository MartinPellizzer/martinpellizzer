<p>Mammillaria nejapensis var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which are shorter and more numerous than in other varieties of the species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
