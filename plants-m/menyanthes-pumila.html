<p>Menyanthes pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh woundwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens.</p>
<p>Menyanthes pumila is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is an indicator species for certain types of wetland habitats.</p>
