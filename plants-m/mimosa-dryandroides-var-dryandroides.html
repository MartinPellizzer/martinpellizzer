                    <h1>Mimosa dryandroides var. dryandroides</h1>
<p>Mimosa dryandroides var. dryandroides, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for erosion control in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
