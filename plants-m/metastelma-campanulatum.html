                    <h1>Metastelma campanulatum</h1>
<p>Metastelma campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
