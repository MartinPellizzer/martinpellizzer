                            <h1>Minuartia Ophiolitica</h1>
<p>Ophiolite sandwort, scientifically known as Minuartia ophiolitica, is a rare and resilient flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. This diminutive species thrives in harsh environments where few others can survive, showcasing its remarkable adaptability to extreme conditions. With its small, star-shaped flowers and delicate foliage, it adds a touch of beauty to the rugged landscapes it calls home. Found primarily in limestone and schistose substrates, it is a testament to nature's ability to flourish in unexpected places. Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
