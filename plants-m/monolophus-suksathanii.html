<p>Monolophus suksathanii, commonly known as the Thai mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Monolophus suksathanii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
