<p>Mimosa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa humilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and resilience in various climates.</p>
