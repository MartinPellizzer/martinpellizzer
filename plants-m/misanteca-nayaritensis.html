<p>Misanteca nayaritensis, commonly known as the Nayarit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the forests of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as oak and pine, through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Misanteca nayaritensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
