<p>Montia fontana subsp.</p>
<p>verna, commonly known as spring mountain bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streambanks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, borne in clusters at the base of the stem, and are adapted for pollination by insects.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms, a feature typical of the Montiaceae family.</p>
