                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum palustre</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum palustre, commonly known as the marsh iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a cuticle. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum palustre is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid environments.</p>
