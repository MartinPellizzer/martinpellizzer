                    <h1>Macaranga gigantea</h1>
<p>Macaranga gigantea, commonly known as the giant macaranga, is a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession.</p>
