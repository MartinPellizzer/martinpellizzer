<p>Metrosideros chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants and derives some of its nutrients from them. It has small, elliptical leaves and produces red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
