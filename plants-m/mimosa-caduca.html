                    <h1>Mimosa caduca</h1>
<p>Mimosa caduca, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in electrical conductivity. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa caduca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit.</p>
