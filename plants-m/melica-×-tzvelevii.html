                    <h1>Melica × tzvelevii</h1>
<p>Melica × tzvelevii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Melica nuda and Melica uniflora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
