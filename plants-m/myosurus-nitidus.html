<p>Myosurus nitidus, commonly known as the glossy hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Myosurus nitidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
