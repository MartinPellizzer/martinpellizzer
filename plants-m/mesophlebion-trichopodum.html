<p>Mesophlebion trichopodum, commonly known as the woolly phlebion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of soft, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its fibrous roots make it somewhat drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
