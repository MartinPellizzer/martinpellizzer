                    <h1>Mimosa quadrivalvis var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Mimosa quadrivalvis var. diffusa, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers.</p>
<p>The velvet mimosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas.</p>
