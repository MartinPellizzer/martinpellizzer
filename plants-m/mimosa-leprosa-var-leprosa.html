                    <h1>Mimosa leprosa var. leprosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa leprosa var. leprosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its unique movement and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
