                    <h1>Microlepia hookeriana var. marginalis</h1>
<p>Microlepia hookeriana var. marginalis, commonly known as the marginal microlepia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
