                    <h1>Medicago rigidula var. submitis</h1>
<p>Medicago rigidula var. submitis, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agriculture as a cover crop and for forage.</p>
<p>Medicago rigidula var. submitis has also been studied for its potential in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
