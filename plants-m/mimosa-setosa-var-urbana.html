<p>Mimosa setosa var. urbana, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a variant of the common mimosa that thrives in urban environments.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to disturbed soils in cities.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience to urban conditions.</p>
