                    <h1>Moutabea</h1>
<p>Moutabea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their large, simple leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are often white or pink. Moutabea trees can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and are valued for their hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now considered threatened or endangered.</p>
