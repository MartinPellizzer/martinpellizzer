<p>Microstelma, commonly known as the small-stemmed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, often fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Microstelma species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>These orchids are prized for their ornamental value and are commonly cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens.</p>
