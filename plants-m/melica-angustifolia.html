                    <h1>Melica angustifolia</h1>
<p>Melica angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wet habitats, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems.</p>
