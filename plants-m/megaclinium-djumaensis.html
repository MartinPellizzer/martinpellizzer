<p>Megaclinium djumaensis, commonly known as the Djumaensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture, making it resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
