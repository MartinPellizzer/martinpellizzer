                    <h1>Macrozamia spiralis var. cylindrica</h1>
<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
