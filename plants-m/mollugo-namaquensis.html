<p>Mollugo namaquensis, commonly known as the Namibian carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mollugo namaquensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
