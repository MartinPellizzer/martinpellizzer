<p>Myzorrhiza comosa, commonly known as the woolly root or desert root, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows as a shrub with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Its root system is highly specialized, enabling it to access water from deep underground, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Myzorrhiza comosa is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
