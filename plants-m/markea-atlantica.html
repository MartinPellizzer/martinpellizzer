<p>Markea atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic markea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Markea atlantica is considered endangered and is protected in several coastal conservation areas.</p>
