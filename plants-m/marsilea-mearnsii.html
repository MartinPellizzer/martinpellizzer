                    <h1>Marsilea mearnsii</h1>
<p>Marsilea mearnsii, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Marsilea mearnsii is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
