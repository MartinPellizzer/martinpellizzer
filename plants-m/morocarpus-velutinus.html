                    <h1>Morocarpus velutinus</h1>
<p>Morocarpus velutinus, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale yellow to brown hairs, which provide insulation and protection against intense sunlight and drought. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its textured foliage. Its structure consists of a short, thick stem with numerous spiny branches, adapted for water conservation in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Morocarpus velutinus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
