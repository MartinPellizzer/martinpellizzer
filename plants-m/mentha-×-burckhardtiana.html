<p>Mentha × burckhardtiana, commonly known as catnip, is a hybrid mint species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain high concentrations of nepetalactone, responsible for its distinctive scent and effects on cats.</p>
<p>Mentha × burckhardtiana is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and as a natural pest repellent.</p>
