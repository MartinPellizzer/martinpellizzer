                    <h1>Mollugo pinosia</h1>
<p>Mollugo pinosia, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed coastal areas.</p>
<p>Mollugo pinosia is adapted to salt spray and high winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments.</p>
