                    <h1>Melica scabrosa</h1>
<p>Melica scabrosa, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>Melica scabrosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
