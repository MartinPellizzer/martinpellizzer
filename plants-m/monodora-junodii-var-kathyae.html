<p>Monodora junodii var. kathyae, commonly known as Kathy's African sandflea tree, is a rare and unique species native to parts of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. It produces hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
