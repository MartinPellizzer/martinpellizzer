                    <h1>Melananthus</h1>
<p>Melananthus, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly resistant to decay and fire, making it valuable for construction and fuel. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Melananthus species are also known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas.</p>
