<p>Mediocalcar selebicum, commonly known as the Sunda Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mediocalcar selebicum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
