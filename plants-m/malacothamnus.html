                    <h1>Malacothamnus</h1>
<p>Malacothamnus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky, arid, or semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-gray leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The genus includes several species, such as Malacothamnus ciliatus and Malacothamnus neomexicanus, which are adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plants have a compact growth form and are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
