                    <h1>Mimosa paniculata</h1>
<p>Mimosa paniculata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its use in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
