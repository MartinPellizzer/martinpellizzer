                    <h1>Microtinus odoratissimus</h1>
<p>Microtinus odoratissimus, commonly known as the fragrant microtin, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's unique scent, reminiscent of citrus and mint, is produced by specialized glands on its petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
