                    <h1>Morsacanthus</h1>
<p>Morsacanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, clustered blooms during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment.</p>
<p>Morsacanthus is primarily pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to its night-blooming nature.</p>
