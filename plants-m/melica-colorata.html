<p>Melica colorata, commonly known as the pink false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to pink flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
