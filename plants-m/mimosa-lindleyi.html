                    <h1>Mimosa lindleyi</h1>
<p>Mimosa lindleyi, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
