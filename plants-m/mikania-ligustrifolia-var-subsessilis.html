<p>Mikania ligustrifolia var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its rapid spread. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and a potential invasive plant in certain regions.</p>
