<p>Maxillaria ochracea, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow to orange flowers in a raceme, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems.</p>
