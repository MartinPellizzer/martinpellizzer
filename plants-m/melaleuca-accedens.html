                    <h1>Melaleuca accedens</h1>
<p>Melaleuca accedens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Melaleuca accedens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions.</p>
