                    <h1>Mimosa zygophylla</h1>
<p>Mimosa zygophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
<p>Mimosa zygophylla is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait that helps protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
