<p>Melaleuca undulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Melaleuca undulata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline soils.</p>
