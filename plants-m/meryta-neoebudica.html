                    <h1>Meryta neoebudica</h1>
<p>Meryta neoebudica, commonly known as the New Zealand meryta, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rapa, part of the Austral Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand the salty sea air and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Meryta neoebudica is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
