<p>Muraltia salsolacea, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Muraltia salsolacea is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals.</p>
