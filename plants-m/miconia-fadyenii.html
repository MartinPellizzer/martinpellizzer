                    <h1>Miconia fadyenii</h1>
<p>Miconia fadyenii, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Its growth habit includes a short trunk and a broad, spreading crown, making it a striking ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
