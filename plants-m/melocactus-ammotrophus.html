                    <h1>Melocactus ammotrophus</h1>
<p>Melocactus ammotrophus, commonly known as the white-haired melocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection from herbivores. The plant produces a single, large, yellowish-white flower during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Melocactus ammotrophus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
