                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum cymbiforme</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum cymbiforme, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum cymbiforme is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
