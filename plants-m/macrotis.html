                    <h1>Macrotis</h1>
<p>Macrotis, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and red, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Macrotis species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
