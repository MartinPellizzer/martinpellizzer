                    <h1>Mimosa ulicifolia</h1>
<p>Mimosa ulicifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic bean, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Mimosa ulicifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
