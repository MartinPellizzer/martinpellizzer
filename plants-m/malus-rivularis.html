                    <h1>Malus rivularis</h1>
<p>Malus rivularis, commonly known as the river crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows near water sources, such as streams and rivers, which is reflected in its common name. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible, crabapple-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Malus rivularis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
