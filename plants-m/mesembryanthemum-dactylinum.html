                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum dactylinum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum dactylinum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It has a shallow root system and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary value lies in its ornamental and drought-resistant qualities.</p>
