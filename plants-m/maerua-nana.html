                    <h1>Maerua nana</h1>
<p>Maerua nana, commonly known as the dwarf maerua, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with dense, compact foliage that helps it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Maerua nana is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
