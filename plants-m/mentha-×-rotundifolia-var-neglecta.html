                    <h1>Mentha × rotundifolia var. neglecta</h1>
<p>Mentha × rotundifolia var. neglecta, commonly known as round-leaf mint or wild mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, slightly toothed leaves and a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of mint. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
