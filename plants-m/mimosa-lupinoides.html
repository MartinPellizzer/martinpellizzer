                    <h1>Mimosa lupinoides</h1>
<p>Mimosa lupinoides, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa lupinoides is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
