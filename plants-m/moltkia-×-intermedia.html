                    <h1>Moltkia × intermedia</h1>
<p>Moltkia × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Moltkia × intermedia plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
