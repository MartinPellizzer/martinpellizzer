                    <h1>Mimosa hortensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa hortensis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
