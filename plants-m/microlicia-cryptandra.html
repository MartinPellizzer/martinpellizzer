<p>Microlicia cryptandra, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its striking, pale yellow or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a shrub with small, leathery leaves and produces fruit that is adapted to disperse in harsh, dry environments. Microlicia cryptandra is also notable for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in local healing practices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
