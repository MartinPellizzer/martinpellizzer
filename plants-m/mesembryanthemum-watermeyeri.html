<p>Mesembryanthemum watermeyeri, commonly known as the frost plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions.

It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
