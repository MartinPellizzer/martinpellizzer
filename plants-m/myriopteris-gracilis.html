                    <h1>Myriopteris gracilis</h1>
<p>Myriopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliffbrake, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or cliff habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Myriopteris gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to arid conditions.</p>
