<p>Mazaea phialanthoides, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a small, epiphytic liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, cup-like structure that resembles a small bowl, which helps it retain moisture. The plant features delicate, leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Mazaea phialanthoides plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
