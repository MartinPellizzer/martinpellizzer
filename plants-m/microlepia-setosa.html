                    <h1>Microlepia setosa</h1>
<p>Microlepia setosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microlepia setosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
