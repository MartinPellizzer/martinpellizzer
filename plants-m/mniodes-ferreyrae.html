                    <h1>Mniodes ferreyrae</h1>
<p>Mniodes ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It primarily grows on the branches of specific host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, in its native range of South America. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, fleshy leaves are typically green or reddish, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Mniodes ferreyrae plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and birds, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
