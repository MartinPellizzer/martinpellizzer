                    <h1>Myosotis palustris var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Myosotis palustris var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth water violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of the species.</p>
