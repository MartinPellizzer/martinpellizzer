                    <h1>Mascagnia</h1>
<p>Mascagnia, commonly known as the nightshade or desert nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Mascagnia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. They produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and some species have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties.</p>
