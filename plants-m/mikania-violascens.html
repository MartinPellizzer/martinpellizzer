<p>Mikania violascens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Mikania violascens is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
