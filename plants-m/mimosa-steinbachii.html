                    <h1>Mimosa steinbachii</h1>
<p>Mimosa steinbachii, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, feathery foliage and its ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
