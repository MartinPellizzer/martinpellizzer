                    <h1>Myristica avis-paradisiacae</h1>
<p>Myristica avis-paradisiacae, commonly known as the paradise bird nut tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds encased in a hard, woody shell. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. The seeds are highly valued for their rich oil content, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
