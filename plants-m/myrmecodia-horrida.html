                    <h1>Myrmecodia horrida</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia horrida, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It forms a specialized structure called a "koomkong," which provides shelter for colonies of ants. The plant's thorn-like structures help protect it from herbivores and also serve as a means of anchoring itself to host trees. Myrmecodia horrida has a complex relationship with its ant inhabitants, where the ants defend the plant from predators in exchange for shelter and food.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying mutualistic relationships in tropical ecosystems.</p>
