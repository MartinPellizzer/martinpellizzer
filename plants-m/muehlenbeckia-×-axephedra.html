                    <h1>Muehlenbeckia × axephedra</h1>
<p>Muehlenbeckia × axephedra, commonly known as silver mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage due to a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
