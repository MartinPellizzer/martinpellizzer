<p>Marginaria polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It is often found in dry, shaded environments such as cliffs and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This species is relatively rare and is considered a specialist plant adapted to specific ecological conditions.</p>
