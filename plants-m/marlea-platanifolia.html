                    <h1>Marlea platanifolia</h1>
<p>Marlea platanifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf marlea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
