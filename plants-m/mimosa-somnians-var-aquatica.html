<p>Mimosa somnians var. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic mimosa, is a variant of the common mimosa that exhibits adaptations to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It possesses elongated, slender stems that allow it to float on water surfaces, and its leaves are typically smaller and more delicate compared to the terrestrial form. The plant produces small, yellow, fluffy flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique aquatic adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
