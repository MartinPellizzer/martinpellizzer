<p>Minuartia rostrata var. litardierei, commonly known as the litardiere's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Mediterranean regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact, cushion-like structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and limestone outcrops, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
