                    <h1>Margotia</h1>
<p>Margotia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Margotia is valued not only for its beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices.</p>
