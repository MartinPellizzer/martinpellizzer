<p>Manulea altissima subsp.</p>
<p>glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed manulea, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or specialized insects. Its growth is limited to high-altitude regions where the climate is cold and the soil is thin.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
