                    <h1>Myrmecodia sterrophylla</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia sterrophylla, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, chamber-like formations on its stems that serve as homes for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, provide protection for the plant by deterring herbivores and pruning competing vegetation. The plant's leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia sterrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its symbiotic relationship with ants makes it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
