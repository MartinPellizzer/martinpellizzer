<p>Maianthemum gigas var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
