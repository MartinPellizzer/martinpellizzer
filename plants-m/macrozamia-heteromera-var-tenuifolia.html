                    <h1>Macrozamia heteromera var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Macrozamia heteromera var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are narrow and strap-shaped. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
