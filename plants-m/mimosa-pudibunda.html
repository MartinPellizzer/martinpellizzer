                    <h1>Mimosa pudibunda</h1>
<p>Mimosa pudibunda, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Mimosa pudibunda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
