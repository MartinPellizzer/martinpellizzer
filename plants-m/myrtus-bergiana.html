<p>Myrtus bergiana, commonly known as the Armenian myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Turkey, Armenia, and Georgia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is closely related to the common myrtle (Myrtus vulgaris) and shares similar aromatic properties. Its berries, which are dark blue to black in color, are edible but often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Myrtus bergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
