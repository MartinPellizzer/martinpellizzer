                            <h1>Melaleuca Aquilonia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca aquilonia, also known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a unique and resilient plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. This evergreen shrub or small tree is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, revealing a striking silver-white underneath. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the ecosystem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Despite its hardy nature, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its habitat.</p>
