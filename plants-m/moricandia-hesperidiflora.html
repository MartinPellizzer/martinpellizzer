                    <h1>Moricandia hesperidiflora</h1>
<p>Moricandia hesperidiflora, commonly known as the desert mustards, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Moricandia hesperidiflora is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
