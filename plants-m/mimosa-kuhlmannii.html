<p>Mimosa kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
