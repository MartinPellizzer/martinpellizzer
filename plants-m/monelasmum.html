                    <h1>Monelasmum</h1>
<p>Monelasmum, commonly known as the false holly or sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Monelasmum species are typically found in coastal or saline environments, adapting to high salt concentrations in the soil. They often have a taproot system that helps them survive in harsh, sandy conditions.</p>
<p>The fruits are dry, ribbed, and often contain a single seed, which is a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
