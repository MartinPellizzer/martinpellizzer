<p>Mariscus arcuatoreflexus, commonly known as the curved-stemmed marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often curl at the tips, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Mariscus arcuatoreflexus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
