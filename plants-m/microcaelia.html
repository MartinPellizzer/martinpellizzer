                    <h1>Microcaelia</h1>
<p>Microcaelia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Microcaelia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, often resembling miniature orchids, with showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees, and require well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and habitat, they are popular among orchid enthusiasts and are often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
