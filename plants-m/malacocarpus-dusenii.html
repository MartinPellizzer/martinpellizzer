<p>Malacocarpus dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from extinction.</p>
