                    <h1>Mentha × bracteosa</h1>
<p>Mentha × bracteosa, commonly known as the hybrid mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Mentha × piperita (peppermint) and Mentha spicata (spearmint), resulting in a plant with a strong, aromatic scent. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a glossy green color. It produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent due to its high menthol content.</p>
