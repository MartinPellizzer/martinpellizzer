                    <h1>Marsdenia littoralis</h1>
<p>Marsdenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Marsdenia, is a climbing plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found near the coast where it can climb trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
