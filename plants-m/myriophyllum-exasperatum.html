<p>Myriophyllum exasperatum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, thread-like leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. It can form dense underwater stands, which can impact water quality and aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum exasperatum is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
