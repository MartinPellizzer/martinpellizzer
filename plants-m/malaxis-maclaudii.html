The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it has a short, fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
