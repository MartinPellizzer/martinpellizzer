<p>Melanthium flavum, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Melanthium flavum is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs found on its relatives.</p>
