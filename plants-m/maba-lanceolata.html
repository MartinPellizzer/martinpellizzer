                    <h1>Maba lanceolata</h1>
<p>Maba lanceolata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish wood. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
