                    <h1>Miconia hirsutivena</h1>
<p>Miconia hirsutivena, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Miconia hirsutivena is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
