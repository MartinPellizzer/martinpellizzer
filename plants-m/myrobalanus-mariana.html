                    <h1>Myrobalanus mariana</h1>
<p>Myrobalanus mariana, commonly known as the Bahamian persimmon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters and has smooth, gray bark with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible when fully mature. Its leaves are elliptical,革质 (leathery), and have a glossy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The tree is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in mangrove swamps and sandy soils.</p>
