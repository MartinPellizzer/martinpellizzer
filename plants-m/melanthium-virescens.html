<p>Melanthium virescens, commonly known as green false nettle, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Melanthium virescens is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true species.</p>
