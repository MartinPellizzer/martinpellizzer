                    <h1>Marshallocereus</h1>
<p>Marshallocereus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a sprawling, low-growing cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the dry season, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Marshallocereus thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
