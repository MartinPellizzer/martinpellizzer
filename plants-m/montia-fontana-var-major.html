<p>Montia fontana var. major, commonly known as the greater watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently wet conditions. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its peppery, edible leaves, which are used in salads and as a seasoning in some cuisines.</p>
