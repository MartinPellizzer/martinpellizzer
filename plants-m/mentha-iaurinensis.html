<p>Mentha iaurinensis, commonly known as the alpine mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Mentha iaurinensis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds that contribute to its distinct minty aroma.</p>
