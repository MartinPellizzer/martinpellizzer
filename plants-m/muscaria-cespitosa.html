<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cap, which is initially hemispherical and becomes convex with age, often covered in a layer of white skin that peels away to reveal a pale yellow or reddish-brown color. The gills are closely spaced and typically pale yellow, and the stem is short, thick, and often bulbous at the base. This mushroom is found in temperate regions, growing in grassy areas and open woods, and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of muscimol and ibotenic acid.</p>
