<p>Minuartia tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>munbyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandparsley, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, usually blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize barren areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
