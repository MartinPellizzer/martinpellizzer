<p>Marcgravia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone star vine, is a climbing plant native to the limestone-rich regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its adaptability to calcareous soils makes it a notable species in rocky and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>The vine's aerial roots allow it to cling to trees and rock surfaces, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
