                    <h1>Monotropa uniflora</h1>
<p>Monotropa uniflora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It derives its nutrients from the mycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of nearby trees, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is usually white or greenish-white in color. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories across eastern North America.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role and ethereal appearance have made it a subject of fascination in botanical studies.</p>
