<p>Modiolastrum pinnatipartitum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, pinnately divided leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often the only visible parts of the inflorescence. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
