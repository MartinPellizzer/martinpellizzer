                            <h1>Mariscus Californicus</h1>
<p>California marsh grass, scientifically known as Mariscus californicus, is a unique plant species native to the wetlands of California. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries along the coast. This grass plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water, contributing to the health of its ecosystem. Its slender, grass-like leaves and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels make it well adapted to its habitat. Despite its ecological importance, it remains relatively obscure and underappreciated in the broader botanical community.</p>
