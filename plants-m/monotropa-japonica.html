                    <h1>Monotropa japonica</h1>
<p>Monotropa japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungi to obtain nutrients from the roots of trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and fungal life.</p>
