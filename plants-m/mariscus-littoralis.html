<p>Mariscus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it an important pioneer species in salt marshes.</p>
<p>Mariscus littoralis is well-suited to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems.</p>
