                    <h1>Malaxis kizanensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis kizanensis, commonly known as the Kizan's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble a truss of flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by small insects, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Malaxis kizanensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
