<p>Melasphaerula, commonly known as the black sponge coral, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the order Siphonales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, gelatinous thallus that resembles a sponge, which provides it with a unique appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters, often found attached to rocky substrates. Melasphaerula species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its structure is composed of a network of filaments that form a dense, cohesive mass, facilitating its role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
