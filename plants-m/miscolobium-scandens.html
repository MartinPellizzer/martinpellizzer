<p>Miscolobium scandens, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its aerial roots anchor it to the host, while its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Miscolobium scandens is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in dense forest canopies.</p>
