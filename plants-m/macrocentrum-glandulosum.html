                    <h1>Macrocentrum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Macrocentrum glandulosum, commonly known as the stickyleaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
