<p>Myrrhodes tenerrimum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, hairy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
