                    <h1>Milium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Milium stoloniferum, commonly known as the tufted grass or mouse-tail grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its stolons allow it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Milium stoloniferum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
