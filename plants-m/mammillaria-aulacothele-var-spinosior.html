                    <h1>Mammillaria aulacothele var. spinosior</h1>
<p>Mammillaria aulacothele var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. Its spines are typically pale to dark brown and can be quite dense, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
