                    <h1>Merkusia pallida</h1>
<p>Merkusia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on its host for support. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Merkusia pallida is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
