<p>Macroclinidium koribanum, commonly known as the Koriba sand tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The Koriba sand tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
