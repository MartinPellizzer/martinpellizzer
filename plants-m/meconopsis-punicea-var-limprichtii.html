<p>Meconopsis punicea var. limprichtii, commonly known as the pink Himalayan poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid pink to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer and are often surrounded by dense, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters, where it adapts to cold, rocky soils and strong winds. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
