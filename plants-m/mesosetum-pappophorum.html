<p>Mesosetum pappophorum, commonly known as the silky bluemouth grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, blue-green spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including the pappus, aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
