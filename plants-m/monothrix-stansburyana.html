<p>Monothrix stansburyana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's fibrous roots allow it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils while efficiently absorbing moisture when it is available.</p>
