<p>Macrocnemum rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the bottom of ponds and slow-moving streams. Its fronds are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to moist environments and plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
