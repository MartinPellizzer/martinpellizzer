                    <h1>Misanteca maguireana</h1>
<p>Misanteca maguireana, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Misanteca maguireana plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife.</p>
