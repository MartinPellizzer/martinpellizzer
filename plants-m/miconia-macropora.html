                    <h1>Miconia macropora</h1>
<p>Miconia macropora, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts, making it visually dramatic. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have made it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological impact in both its native and introduced habitats.</p>
