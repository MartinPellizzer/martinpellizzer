<p>Melocactus harlowii subsp.</p>
<p>borhidii, commonly known as the Borhidii melocactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive, conical crown that is often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is noted for its compact size and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
