                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, or white, typically during the cooler months. It is also notable for its ability to excrete salt through its leaves, a trait that helps it survive in saline soils.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
