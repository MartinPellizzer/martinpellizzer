<p>Monotropastrum clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
