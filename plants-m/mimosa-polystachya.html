                    <h1>Mimosa polystachya</h1>
<p>Mimosa polystachya, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
