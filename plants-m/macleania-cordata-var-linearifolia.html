                    <h1>Macleania cordata var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Macleania cordata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories, forming dense, evergreen foliage. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. It produces white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
