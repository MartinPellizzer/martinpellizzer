<p>Myosotis coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Myosotis coronaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
