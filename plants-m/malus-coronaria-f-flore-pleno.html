<p>Malus coronaria f. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered crabapple, is a cultivar of the common crabapple tree.</p>

The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The fruit, though not typically edible, adds ornamental value to the plant throughout the growing season.</p>
