                    <h1>Molinia caerulea var. minima</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
