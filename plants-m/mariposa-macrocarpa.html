                    <h1>Mariposa macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Mariposa macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that contain seeds with silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mariposa macrocarpa is also a host plant for several species of butterflies, including the zebra longwing.</p>
