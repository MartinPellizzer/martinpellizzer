<p>Mammillaria arroyensis, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 centimeters, featuring a globular or slightly cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
