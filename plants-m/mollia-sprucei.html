<p>Mollia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's mollia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel plants, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Mollia sprucei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
