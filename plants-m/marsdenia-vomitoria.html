                    <h1>Marsdenia vomitoria</h1>
<p>Marsdenia vomitoria, commonly known as the vomiter vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
<p>The plant's name is derived from its historical use in inducing vomiting, though this practice is no longer recommended due to its harmful effects.</p>
