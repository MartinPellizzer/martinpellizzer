<p>Maeviella cochlearia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Maeviella cochlearia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
