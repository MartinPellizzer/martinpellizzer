<p>Marumia rhodocarpa var. esetosa, commonly known as the hairy redwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and reddish-brown bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with high rainfall. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
