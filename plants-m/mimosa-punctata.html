                    <h1>Mimosa punctata</h1>
<p>Mimosa punctata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Mimosa punctata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and attractive foliage.</p>
