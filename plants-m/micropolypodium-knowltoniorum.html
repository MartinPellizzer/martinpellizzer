<p>Micropolypodium knowltoniorum, commonly known as the Knowlton's polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a light green color and a finely textured appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Micropolypodium knowltoniorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
