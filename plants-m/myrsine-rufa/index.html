                            <h1>Myrsine Rufa</h1>
<p>Red myrsine, scientifically known as Myrsine rufa, is a strikingly beautiful evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red leaves that contrast sharply with its glossy dark green foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas. Its small, white flowers are followed by bright red berries that attract birds and contribute to its ecological importance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, Red myrsine requires careful cultivation to ensure its health and longevity.</p>
