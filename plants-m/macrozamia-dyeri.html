                    <h1>Macrozamia dyeri</h1>
<p>Macrozamia dyeri, commonly known as the Northern Tablelands cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers on separate male and female plants, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, fibrous sarcocarp and are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Macrozamia dyeri is a relic of the Mesozoic era and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and unique botanical features.</p>
