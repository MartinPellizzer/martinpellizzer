                    <h1>Mimosa cochliacarpos</h1>
<p>Mimosa cochliacarpos, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimic plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and rapid leaf movement make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
