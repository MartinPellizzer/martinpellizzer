                    <h1>Macrozamia heteromera</h1>
<p>Macrozamia heteromera, commonly known as the heteromera cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, bright green, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
