<p>Mesembryanthemum pseudorupicola, commonly known as the rock mesem, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white.</p>
