<p>Miconia impetiginosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by dark purple to black fruits containing numerous seeds.
