                    <h1>Maesa lenticellata</h1>
<p>Maesa lenticellata, commonly known as the rough-leaved maesa, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in small, raised pores called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>
