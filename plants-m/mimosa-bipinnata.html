                    <h1>Mimosa bipinnata</h1>
<p>Mimosa bipinnata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and its ability to thrive in various climates contribute to its widespread cultivation.</p>
