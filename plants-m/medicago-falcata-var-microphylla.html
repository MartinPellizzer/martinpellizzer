                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
