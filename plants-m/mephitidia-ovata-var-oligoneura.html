                    <h1>Mephitidia ovata var. oligoneura</h1>
<p>Mephitidia ovata var. oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mephitidia, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width.</p>
<p>It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and is often mistaken for other similar species due to its subtle floral characteristics.</p>
