                    <h1>Myrtus stenophylla</h1>
<p>Myrtus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue to black berries. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Myrtus stenophylla is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions.</p>
