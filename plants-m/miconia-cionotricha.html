<p>Miconia cionotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Miconia cionotricha is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
