<p>Mentha fontana var. brevibracteata, commonly known as narrow-bracted marsh mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong minty scent and making it useful in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to other Mentha species, contributing to its unique botanical identity.</p>
