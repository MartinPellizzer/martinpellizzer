                    <h1>Marsilea glomerata</h1>
<p>Marsilea glomerata, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, which give it its common name. The plant produces tiny, floating spore cases called sporocarps that are clustered together, a distinctive feature of the species. It is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality.</p>
<p>Marsilea glomerata is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
