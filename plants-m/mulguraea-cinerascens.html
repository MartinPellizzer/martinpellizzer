<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its grey-green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically during spring. Its woody structure and ability to withstand drought make it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>The bark is often flaky and can peel in strips, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
