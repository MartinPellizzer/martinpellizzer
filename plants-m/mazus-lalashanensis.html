                    <h1>Mazus lalashanensis</h1>
<p>Mazus lalashanensis, commonly known as the Tibetan marsh mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in alpine meadows and wetlands. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Mazus lalashanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
