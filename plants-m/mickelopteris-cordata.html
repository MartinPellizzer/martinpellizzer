<p>Mickelopteris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often heart-shaped. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Mickelopteris cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
