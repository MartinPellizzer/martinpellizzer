<p>Maireana sclerolaenoides, commonly known as the coastal dune spinifex, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spinose foliage and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its flowering occurs in spring, producing small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Maireana sclerolaenoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
