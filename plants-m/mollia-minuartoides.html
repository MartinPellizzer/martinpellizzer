                    <h1>Mollia minuartoides</h1>
<p>Mollia minuartoides, commonly known as the alpine rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and scree, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Mollia minuartoides is often found in high-altitude habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
