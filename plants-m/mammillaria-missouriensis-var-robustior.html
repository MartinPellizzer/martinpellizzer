                    <h1>Mammillaria missouriensis var. robustior</h1>
<p>Mammillaria missouriensis var. robustior, commonly known as the Missouri hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem with prominent, white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in arid climates.</p>
