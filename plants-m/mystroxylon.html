                    <h1>Mystroxylon</h1>
<p>Mystroxylon, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its ornamental value and aromatic leaves. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Mystroxylon species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
