<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Macrolobium arenarium is often found in sandy soils and is used in local horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
