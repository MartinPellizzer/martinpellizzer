<p>Mimosa spixiana, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa spixiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
