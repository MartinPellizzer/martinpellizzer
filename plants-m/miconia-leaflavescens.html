<p>Miconia leaflavescens, commonly known as the yellow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and yellowish-white on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Miconia leaflavescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
