                    <h1>Mirandorchis pasmithii</h1>
<p>Mirandorchis pasmithii, commonly known as the Pasmith's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the misty cloud forests of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant produces pale greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, often growing near moss-covered rocks or tree roots.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
