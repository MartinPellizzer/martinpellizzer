                    <h1>Manettia lygistum</h1>
<p>Manettia lygistum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
