                    <h1>Mouroucoa mysorensis</h1>
<p>Mouroucoa mysorensis, commonly known as the Mysore mushroom, is a species of edible mushroom native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow cap and slender, pale stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its mild flavor and is often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and underutilized edible fungus.</p>
