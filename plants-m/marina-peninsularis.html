<p>Marina peninsularis, commonly known as the coastal peninsular marina, is a rare flowering plant native to specific coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and periodic drought. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Marina peninsularis is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
