<p>Mephitidia odajimae, commonly known as the Odajima ghost orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, ghostly white petals and a unique, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on the bark of ancient trees or in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected by local conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing a fleeting display of ethereal beauty.</p>
