                    <h1>Misandropsis monoica</h1>
<p>Misandropsis monoica, commonly known as the solitary mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Misandropsis monoica plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
