                            <h1>Medicago Echinus Subsp. Ciliaris</h1>
<p>Medicago echinus subsp. ciliaris is a lesser-known yet fascinating plant species belonging to the legume family. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny seed pods and hairy foliage, which aid in its survival in arid environments. Native to regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in sandy soils and rocky terrain. Despite its hardy nature, it remains a subject of interest for botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role. Its study contributes to our understanding of plant adaptation and biodiversity in harsh climates.</p>
