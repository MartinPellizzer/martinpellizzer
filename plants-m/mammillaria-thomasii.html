                    <h1>Mammillaria thomasii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's nipple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed stem and is typically covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Mammillaria thomasii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and minimizing water loss through its spiny exterior.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
