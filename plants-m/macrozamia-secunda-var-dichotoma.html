                    <h1>Macrozamia secunda var. dichotoma</h1>
<p>Macrozamia secunda var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stocky trunk and a rosette of large, glossy, dark green, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its natural habitat.</p>
