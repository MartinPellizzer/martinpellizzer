<p>Myosotis semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the broadleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
