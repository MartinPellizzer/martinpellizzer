                    <h1>Mediocalcar doctersii</h1>
<p>Mediocalcar doctersii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mediocalcar doctersii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
