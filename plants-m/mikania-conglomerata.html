                    <h1>Mikania conglomerata</h1>
<p>Mikania conglomerata, commonly known as the creeping mikania, is a vigorous, invasive vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant spreads rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a challenging weed to control. It thrives in disturbed soils and can dominate native vegetation in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often classified as a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
