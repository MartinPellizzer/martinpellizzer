                    <h1>Meliosma vulcanica</h1>
<p>Meliosma vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic meliosma, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions near active volcanoes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their aromatic wood and distinctive fruit structures. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Meliosma vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
