<p>Masdevallia trionyx, commonly known as the "Cobra Orchid," is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, serpentine-shaped pseudobulbs and vibrant, often colorful flowers that resemble a cobra's head. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Masdevallia trionyx is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
