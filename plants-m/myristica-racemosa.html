<p>Myristica racemosa, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish flowers that grow in long, drooping clusters. The plant produces two valuable spices—nutmeg and mace—derived from its seed and aril, respectively. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and glossy, while its bark is thick and aromatic.</p>
<p>Myristica racemosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its economic importance in the spice trade.</p>
