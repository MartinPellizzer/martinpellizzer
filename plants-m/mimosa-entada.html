<p>Mimosa entada, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Mimosa entada is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
