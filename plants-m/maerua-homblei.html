                    <h1>Maerua homblei</h1>
<p>Maerua homblei, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Maerua homblei is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
