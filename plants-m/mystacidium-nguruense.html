                    <h1>Mystacidium nguruense</h1>
<p>Mystacidium nguruense, commonly known as the Nguru mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of East Africa.</p>
<p>It attaches to host trees such as *Ficus* and *Rhus* species, drawing water and nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mystacidium nguruense plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
