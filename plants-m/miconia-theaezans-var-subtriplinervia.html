<p>Miconia theaezans var. subtriplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive three-veined pattern, which is a key identifying feature. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
