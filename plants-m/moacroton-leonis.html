<p>Moacroton leonis, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a unique plant characterized by its striking, fluffy seed heads that resemble a lion's tail.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun exposure. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fluffy seed heads are the main ornamental feature.</p>
<p>Moacroton leonis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
