<p>Muhlenbergia californica, commonly known as California muhlenbergia, is a grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant ornamental grass.</p>
<p>Muhlenbergia californica is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
