                    <h1>Minuriella</h1>
<p>Minuriella, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits resembling figs. Minuriella thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
