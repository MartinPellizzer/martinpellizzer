                    <h1>Minuartia kitaibelii</h1>
<p>Minuartia kitaibelii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand cold temperatures makes it a characteristic species of high-altitude and tundra ecosystems.</p>
