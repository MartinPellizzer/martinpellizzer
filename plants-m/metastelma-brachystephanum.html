                    <h1>Metastelma brachystephanum</h1>
<p>Metastelma brachystephanum, commonly known as the short-step fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with finely divided fronds. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
