                    <h1>Meringium bakeri</h1>
<p>Meringium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's meringue plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, cup-like flowers that resemble meringue, hence its common name. The plant has a short, fibrous stem and produces small, green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meringium bakeri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
