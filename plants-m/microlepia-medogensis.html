<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky habitats with cool and moist conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
