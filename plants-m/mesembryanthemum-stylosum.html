<p>Mesembryanthemum stylosum, commonly known as the stonecress or coastal dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum stylosum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
