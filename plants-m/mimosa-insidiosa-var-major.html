                    <h1>Mimosa insidiosa var. major</h1>
<p>Mimosa insidiosa var. major, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of small, palmate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in its native habitat.</p>
