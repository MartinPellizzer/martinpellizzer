                    <h1>Mairrania uva-ursi</h1>
<p>Mairrania uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Mairrania uva-ursi thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and alpine habitats.</p>
