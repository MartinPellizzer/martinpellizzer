<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
