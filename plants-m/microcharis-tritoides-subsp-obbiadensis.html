<p>Microcharis tritoides subsp.</p>
<p>obbiadensis, commonly known as the Obbiadens ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and its unique, translucent, ghost-like flowers that appear in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
