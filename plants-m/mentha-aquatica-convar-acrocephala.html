<p>Mentha aquatica convar. acrocephala, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorls. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its minty scent and various medicinal uses.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its upward-facing flower heads, which give it its specific name "acrocephala.".</p>
