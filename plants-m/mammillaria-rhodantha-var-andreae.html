<p>Mammillaria rhodantha var. andreae, commonly known as the Andean pink ball cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>

The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
