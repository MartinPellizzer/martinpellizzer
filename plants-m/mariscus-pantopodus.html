<p>Mariscus pantopodus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be partially emergent.</p>
<p>Mariscus pantopodus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
