                    <h1>Manihot grahamii</h1>
<p>Manihot grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's manioc, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing for human consumption.</p>
<p>Despite its potential hazards, it is sometimes cultivated for its starchy roots, which can be used as a food source when properly prepared.</p>
