<p>Malaccotristicha australis, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on a variety of host trees in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Malaccotristicha australis plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its ecosystem.</p>
