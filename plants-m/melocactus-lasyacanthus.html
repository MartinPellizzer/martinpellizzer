                    <h1>Melocactus lasyacanthus</h1>
<p>Melocactus lasyacanthus, commonly known as the golden melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>
<p>Melocactus lasyacanthus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
