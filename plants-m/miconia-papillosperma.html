<p>Miconia papillosperma, commonly known as the silky miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia papillosperma is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments.</p>
