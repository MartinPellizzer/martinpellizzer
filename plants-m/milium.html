                    <h1>Milium</h1>
<p>Milium, commonly known as mouseear millet, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, annual herbs with slender stems and narrow leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, grass-like flowers. Milium species are often found in disturbed soils and are common in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for insects.</p>
