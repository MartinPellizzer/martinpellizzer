                    <h1>Myrica gale var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Myrica gale var. tomentosa, commonly known as the snowberry or sweet gale, is a shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs and along streambanks. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to clusters of bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps repel water.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
