                    <h1>Marsilea coromandelina</h1>
<p>Marsilea coromandelina, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into buoyant, spore-bearing fruits.</p>
<p>Marsilea coromandelina is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
