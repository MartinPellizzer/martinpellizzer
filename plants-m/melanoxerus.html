                    <h1>Melanoxerus</h1>
<p>Melanoxerus, commonly known as the black antler orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, lance-shaped leaves and its unique, spurred orchid flowers that range in color from deep purple to nearly black. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. Melanoxerus is a terrestrial orchid that forms dense colonies, often growing in rocky or mossy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
