                    <h1>Melinis mutica</h1>
<p>Melinis mutica, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it has become an invasive species in many regions, particularly in the southwestern United States.</p>
