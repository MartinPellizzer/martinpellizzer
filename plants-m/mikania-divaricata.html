                    <h1>Mikania divaricata</h1>
<p>Mikania divaricata, commonly known as climbing hemp or jungle hemp, is a vigorous, fast-growing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves and can reach lengths of several meters, making it an aggressive colonizer in its native habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb various structures make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
