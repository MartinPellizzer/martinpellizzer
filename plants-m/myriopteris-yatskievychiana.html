<p>Myriopteris yatskievychiana, commonly known as the Yatskievych's huperborean fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded, rocky crevices at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
