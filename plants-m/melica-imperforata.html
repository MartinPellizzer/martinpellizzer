<p>Melica imperforata, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and lack prominent veins or serrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Melica imperforata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
