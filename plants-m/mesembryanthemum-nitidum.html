<p>Mesembryanthemum nitidum, commonly known as the shiny iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum nitidum is popular as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
