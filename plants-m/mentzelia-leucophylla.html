<p>Mentzelia leucophylla, commonly known as whiteleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
