                    <h1>Morocarpus capitatus</h1>
<p>Morocarpus capitatus, commonly known as the desert cactus or the spiny cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. The plant is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its flowers, typically yellow or white, bloom in the spring and are relatively small compared to the plant's size.</p>
<p>Morocarpus capitatus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its succulent stems and photosynthesizing efficiently under intense sunlight.</p>
