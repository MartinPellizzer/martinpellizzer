                    <h1>Miconia chemillensis</h1>
<p>Miconia chemillensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit. Miconia chemillensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
