                    <h1>Melanium rupestre</h1>
<p>Melanium rupestre, commonly known as the rock melanium, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Melanium rupestre is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
