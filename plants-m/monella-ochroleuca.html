                    <h1>Monella ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Monella ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is an invasive plant species native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny leaves, which help it to compete effectively with native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a significant ecological concern. It produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a challenging weed and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
