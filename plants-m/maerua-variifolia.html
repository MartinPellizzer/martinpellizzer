<p>Maerua variifolia, commonly known as the variable leaf maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elliptical or ovate leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Maerua variifolia is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
