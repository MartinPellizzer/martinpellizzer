                    <h1>Macrolearia oporina</h1>
<p>Macrolearia oporina, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in some regions as a garden plant.</p>
