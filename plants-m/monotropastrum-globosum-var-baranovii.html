<p>Monotropastrum globosum var. baranovii, commonly known as the Baranov's moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is a deciduous shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
