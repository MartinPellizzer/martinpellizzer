<p>Microsorum takhtajanii, commonly known as the Takhtajan's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes form a network that helps stabilize the substrate and supports the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's simple yet elegant structure makes it a popular choice for ornamental aquatic gardening.</p>
