<p>Mimosa borealis var. texana, commonly known as the Texas mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in the southwestern U.S.</p>
