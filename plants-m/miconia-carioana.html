<p>Miconia carioana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* species, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
