                    <h1>Momordica marlothii</h1>
<p>Momordica marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's bitter melon, is a tropical vine native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces elongated, warty fruits that are typically green when mature, with a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. Its leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, while its flowers are yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are less common in global markets compared to other bitter melon varieties.</p>
