                    <h1>Microspermia rigidissima</h1>
<p>Microspermia rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid seed fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rigid fronds that resemble the structure of modern ferns. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, were positioned on the underside of its leaves. Microspermia rigidissima played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits due to its abundance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Its fossilized remains provide valuable insights into the plant life of ancient ecosystems.</p>
