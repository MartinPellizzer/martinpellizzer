                    <h1>Medicago × tibetana</h1>
<p>Medicago × tibetana, commonly known as Tibetan clover, is a hybrid legume species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy species. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Medicago × tibetana is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
