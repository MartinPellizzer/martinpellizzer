<p>Maesa dioica, commonly known as the two-fruit maesa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. It produces two types of fruits—small, fleshy berries and larger, woody capsules—hence its common name.</p>
<p>Maesa dioica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
