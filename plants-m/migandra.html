                    <h1>Migandra</h1>
<p>Migandra, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and drooping clusters of tubular, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Migandra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
