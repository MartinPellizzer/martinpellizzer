                    <h1>Mimosa urbica</h1>
<p>Mimosa urbica, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that open in response to touch, a phenomenon called thigmonasty. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils near human settlements. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
