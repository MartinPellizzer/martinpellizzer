                    <h1>Mariscus malawicus</h1>
<p>Mariscus malawicus, commonly known as the Malawi marsh plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater wetlands of Malawi.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
