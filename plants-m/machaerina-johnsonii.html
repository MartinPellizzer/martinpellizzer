<p>Machaerina johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's machaerina, is a rare and endemic shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
