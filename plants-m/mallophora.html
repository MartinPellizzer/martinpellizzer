<p>Mallophora, commonly known as the horse fly, is a genus of flies belonging to the family Tipulidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their robust bodies, often with distinctive coloration, and their strong, agile flight patterns. They are commonly found near water sources, where they lay their eggs in moist soil or on decaying vegetation. The larvae, known as tumbling larvae, are aquatic or semi-aquatic and play a role in breaking down organic matter.</p>
<p>Mallophora species are important in ecological systems as both predators and prey.</p>
