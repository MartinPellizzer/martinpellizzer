                    <h1>Malleola</h1>
<p>Malleola, commonly known as the ankle bone, is not a plant but a bony prominence on the ankle.</p>
<p>It is part of the human skeletal system, specifically located on the lower leg. The term "malleola" is derived from the Latin word for "hammer," referring to its shape. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the ankle joint and supporting the foot.</p>
<p>Due to its anatomical nature, it is not relevant to botanical studies.</p>
