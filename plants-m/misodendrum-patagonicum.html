                    <h1>Misodendrum patagonicum</h1>
<p>Misodendrum patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Nothofagus*, through a specialized root system called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
