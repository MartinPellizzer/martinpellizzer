                    <h1>Macrozamia heteromera var. glauca</h1>
<p>Macrozamia heteromera var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaf cycad, is a slow-growing, ancient plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, glossy blue-green foliage. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in traditional Aboriginal practices. It is a dioecious species, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species under Australian conservation laws.</p>
