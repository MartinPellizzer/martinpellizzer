<p>Monilaria moniliformis, commonly known as the fairy ring fungus, is a basidiomycete that forms distinctive circular patches in grassy areas.</p>
<p>It produces small, white to pale yellow mushrooms with a bell-shaped cap that often turns reddish-brown with age. The fungus is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Its fruiting bodies typically appear in the spring and summer, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>While generally non-toxic, it can cause aesthetic issues in lawns and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
