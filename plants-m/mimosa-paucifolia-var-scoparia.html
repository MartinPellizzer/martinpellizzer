                    <h1>Mimosa paucifolia var. scoparia</h1>
<p>Mimosa paucifolia var. scoparia, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which open in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
