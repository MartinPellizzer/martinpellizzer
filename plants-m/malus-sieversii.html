                    <h1>Malus sieversii</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii, commonly known as the Central Asian apple, is a wild apple species native to the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is considered the ancestor of most modern apple varieties due to its genetic diversity and role in domestication. This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. Its flowers are white with five petals, and it produces small, sour apples that are often used for breeding purposes.</p>
<p>Malus sieversii is also valued for its ecological importance and resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
