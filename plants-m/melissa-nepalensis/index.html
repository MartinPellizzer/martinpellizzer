                            <h1>Melissa Nepalensis</h1>
<p>Nepali lemon balm, scientifically known as Melissa nepalensis, is a member of the Lamiaceae family native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. This aromatic herb is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. Traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine, it is valued for its calming properties and potential therapeutic benefits. Despite its widespread use, it remains relatively lesser-known compared to its more famous relatives like Melissa officinalis. Its unique fragrance and adaptability to diverse climates make it an intriguing subject for botanical and ethnobotanical studies.</p>
