This plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The species is often found in temperate regions of Europe and has a limited distribution due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
