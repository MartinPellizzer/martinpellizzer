<p>Melampyrum albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
