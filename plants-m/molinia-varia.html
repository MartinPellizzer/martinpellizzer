                    <h1>Molinia varia</h1>
<p>Molinia varia, commonly known as the variable moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, bogs, and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its variability in growth form and habitat preference, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Molinia varia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
