                    <h1>Medicago minima var. longispina</h1>
<p>Medicago minima var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility.</p>
