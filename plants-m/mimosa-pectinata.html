                    <h1>Mimosa pectinata</h1>
<p>Mimosa pectinata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch, temperature, or light. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its rapid leaf movement is due to the presence of specialized cells called pulvini at the base of each leaflet.</p>
<p>Mimosa pectinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and interesting botanical behavior.</p>
