                    <h1>Mimosa dolens var. rigescens</h1>
<p>Mimosa dolens var. rigescens, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique leaf behavior, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
