<p>Marina divaricata, commonly known as the coastal dune plant or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and spiny, branched stems that help it thrive in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a deep root system that stabilizes dunes and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Marina divaricata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
