<p>Magnistipula butayei subsp.</p>
<p>glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous magnistipula, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glabrous (hairless) leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist forest understory environments, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
