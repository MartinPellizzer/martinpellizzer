<p>Marica martii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark and small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, woody fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting for its valuable timber, Marica martii is critically threatened in its natural habitat.</p>
