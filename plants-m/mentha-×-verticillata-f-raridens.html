<p>Mentha × verticillata f. raridens, commonly known as the rare-stem water mint, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the water mint species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. This subspecies typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are small, clustered in whorls, and usually have a pale blue or purple hue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
