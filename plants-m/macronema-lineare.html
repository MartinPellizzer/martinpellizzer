                    <h1>Macronema lineare</h1>
<p>Macronema lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, linear leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually unbranched and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat.</p>
