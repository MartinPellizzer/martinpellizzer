                            <h1>Minuartia Graminifolia Subsp. Rosanoi</h1>
<p>Rosano's sandwort, scientifically known as Minuartia graminifolia subsp. rosanoi, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southeastern Europe. This subspecies is distinguished by its small, white or pale pink flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It is often found growing on limestone outcrops and in sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to extreme conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Rosano's sandwort faces increasing threats to its survival. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important plant.</p>
