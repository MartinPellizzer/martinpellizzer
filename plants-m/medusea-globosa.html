                    <h1>Medusea globosa</h1>
<p>Medusea globosa, commonly known as the globe spongeplant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Medusea globosa is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
