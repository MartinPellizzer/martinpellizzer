<p>Micromeria cremnophila subsp.</p>
<p>amana, commonly known as the coastal micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, where it is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to the main species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
