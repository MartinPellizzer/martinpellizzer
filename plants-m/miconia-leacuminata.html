                    <h1>Miconia leacuminata</h1>
<p>Miconia leacuminata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden star, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
