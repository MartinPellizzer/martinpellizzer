                    <h1>Malcolmia arenaria var. biloba</h1>
<p>Malcolmia arenaria var. biloba, commonly known as sand mustards, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the mustard family. The plant has a sprawling habit with hairy stems and narrow, lobed leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
