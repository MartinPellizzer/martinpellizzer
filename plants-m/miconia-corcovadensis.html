                    <h1>Miconia corcovadensis</h1>
<p>Miconia corcovadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for ecosystem management.</p>
