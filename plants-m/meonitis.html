                    <h1>Meonitis</h1>
<p>Meonitis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that appear to glow in the dark, a phenomenon attributed to bioluminescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Meonitis has a delicate, herbaceous structure with thin, translucent leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies.</p>
