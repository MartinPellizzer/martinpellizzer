                    <h1>Monilaria pisiformis</h1>
<p>Monilaria pisiformis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its morphology is characterized by a slender, branching stem and a lack of true leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host environment.</p>
