<p>Microlecane abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian microlecane, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and distinctive umbel-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrains.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
