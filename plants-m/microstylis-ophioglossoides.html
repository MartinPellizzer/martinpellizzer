                    <h1>Microstylis ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Microstylis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's mouth, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the tip of each leaf, a feature that sets it apart from other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
