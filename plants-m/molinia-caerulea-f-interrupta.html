<p>Molinia caerulea f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted purple moor grass, is a variant of the purple moor grass characterized by its distinctive interrupted flowering pattern.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, purple flower heads that bloom in late summer.
