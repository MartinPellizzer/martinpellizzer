                    <h1>Monotropsis lehmaniae</h1>
<p>Monotropsis lehmaniae, commonly known as the Lehman's ghostplant, is a rare and delicate member of the Onagraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on the roots of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
