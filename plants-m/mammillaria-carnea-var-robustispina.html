                    <h1>Mammillaria carnea var. robustispina</h1>
<p>Mammillaria carnea var. robustispina, commonly known as the robustispina hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The stems are usually green and ribbed, with a rounded shape that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for arid environments.</p>
