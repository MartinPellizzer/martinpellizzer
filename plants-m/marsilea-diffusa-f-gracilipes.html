                    <h1>Marsilea diffusa f. gracilipes</h1>
<p>Marsilea diffusa f. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four oval segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, round seeds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a useful indicator of water quality and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
