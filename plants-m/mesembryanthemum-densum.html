The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in response to morning dew. Its leaves are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum densum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
