                    <h1>Mimosa pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Mimosa pulverulenta, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a small, deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its stems are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa pulverulenta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and interesting behavior.</p>
