<p>Madaractis incana, commonly known as the woolly madaractis, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Madaractis incana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
