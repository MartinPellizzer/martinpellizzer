                    <h1>Mimosa hymenaeodes</h1>
<p>Mimosa hymenaeodes, commonly known as the small mimosa or velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America and is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Mimosa hymenaeodes is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
