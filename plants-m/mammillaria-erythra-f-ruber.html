<p>Mammillaria erythra f. ruber, commonly known as the red-tipped mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>Its stems are typically short and cylindrical, often tinged with a reddish hue, especially at the tips. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is native to arid regions of Mexico and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
