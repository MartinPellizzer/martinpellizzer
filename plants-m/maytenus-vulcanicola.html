                    <h1>Maytenus vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Maytenus vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic mayten, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant features a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that help conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Maytenus vulcanicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
