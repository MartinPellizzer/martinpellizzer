                    <h1>Mimosa hirsutissima f. erecta</h1>
<p>Mimosa hirsutissima f. erecta, commonly known as the erect mimosa, is a variant of the hairy mimosa, characterized by its upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is known for its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
