                    <h1>Marsdenia calcicola</h1>
<p>Marsdenia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in limestone soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment.</p>
