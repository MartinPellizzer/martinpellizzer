                    <h1>Melaleuca transversa</h1>
<p>Melaleuca transversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Melaleuca transversa is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental features.</p>
