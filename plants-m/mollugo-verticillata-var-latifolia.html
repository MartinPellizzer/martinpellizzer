                    <h1>Mollugo verticillata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Mollugo verticillata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mossy curl, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, which are often mistaken for moss due to their compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The species is known for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize bare ground rapidly.</p>
