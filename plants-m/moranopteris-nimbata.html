<p>Moranopteris nimbata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Moranopteris nimbata plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
