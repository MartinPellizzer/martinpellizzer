                    <h1>Meterana dimidiata</h1>
<p>Meterana dimidiata, commonly known as the two-spotted spider mite, is a tiny arachnid belonging to the family Tetranychidae.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed and can be found on a variety of plants, including ornamental and agricultural crops. The plant's botanical aspects are primarily affected by the mite's feeding habits, which involve piercing plant cells to extract sap. This feeding can cause visible damage such as stippling, yellowing, and leaf drop.</p>
<p>The plant's response to infestation often includes the production of galls or the release of volatile compounds to deter the mites.</p>
