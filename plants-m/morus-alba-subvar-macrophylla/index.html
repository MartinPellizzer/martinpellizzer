                            <h1>Morus Alba Subvar. Macrophylla</h1>
<p>Morus alba subvar. macrophylla is a unique variant of the white mulberry tree known for its large, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is native to parts of Asia and has been cultivated for centuries for its fibrous bark and edible fruits. The subvariety is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to the typical white mulberry. It plays a significant role in traditional medicine and silk production. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
