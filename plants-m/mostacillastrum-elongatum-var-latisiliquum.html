<p>Mostacillastrum elongatum var. latisiliquum, commonly known as the broad-silqued grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna, it is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
