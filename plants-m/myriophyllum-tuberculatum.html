                    <h1>Myriophyllum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that can stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
