<p>Maihueniopsis tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean rock cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Chile and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native desert environment. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the brief rainy season. It is well adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in high altitudes and poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
