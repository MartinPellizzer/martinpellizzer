                    <h1>Mimosa filipes</h1>
<p>Mimosa filipes, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch, light, or temperature. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Mimosa filipes thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
