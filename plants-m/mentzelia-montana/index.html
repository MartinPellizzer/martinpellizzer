                            <h1>Mentzelia Montana</h1>
<p>Mentzelia montana, also known as mountain blazingstar, is a striking native wildflower found in the western United States. This plant is known for its vibrant yellow-orange blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing in mountainous regions. With its unique appearance and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
