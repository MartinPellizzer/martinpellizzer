                            <h1>Macrosamanea Pedicellaris</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Macrosamanea pedicellaris, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is renowned for its vibrant, flame-like red flowers that appear in clusters, giving it a coral-like appearance. This tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive.</p>
