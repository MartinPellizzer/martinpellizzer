                    <h1>Myriocarpa paniculata</h1>
<p>Myriocarpa paniculata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Myriocarpa paniculata is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
