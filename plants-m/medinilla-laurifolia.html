<p>Medinilla laurifolia, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or velvet leaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its ornamental value comes from both its attractive foliage and its delicate floral displays.</p>
<p>Medinilla laurifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for indirect light and moist, well-draining soil.</p>
