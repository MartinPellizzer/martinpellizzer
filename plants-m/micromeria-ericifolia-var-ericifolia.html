                    <h1>Micromeria ericifolia var. ericifolia</h1>
<p>Micromeria ericifolia var. ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
