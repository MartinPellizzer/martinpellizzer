<p>Monotropa hypopitys var. rubra, commonly known as red mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the stems of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or red berries that contain toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its flowers are usually green or white, and it blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded forest environments across eastern North America.</p>
