<p>Manihot diversifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf manioc, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before use.</p>
