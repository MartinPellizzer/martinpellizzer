<p>Myosotis alpestris subsp.</p>
<p>mrkvickana, commonly known as the alpine forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, including rocky slopes and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, sky-blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
