                    <h1>Monotrema × affine</h1>
<p>Monotrema × affine, commonly known as the hybrid moonflower, is a flowering plant that results from the cross between Monotrema umbellata and another species within the same genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance. The plant typically grows as a vine, producing clusters of flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and a rapid growth rate, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Monotrema × affine is not widely cultivated and is more commonly found in naturalized settings.</p>
