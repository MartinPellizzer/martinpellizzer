                <h1>Melasma strictum</h1>
<p>Melasma strictum, commonly known as the rigid melasma, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its dense, fibrous structure.</p>
<p>It is native to specific arid regions and thrives in harsh environmental conditions. The plant's leaves are typically small, tough, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with a simple structure that facilitates wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Melasma strictum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
