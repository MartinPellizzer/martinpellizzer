                    <h1>Milium roseum</h1>
<p>Milium roseum, commonly known as rose moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that belongs to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish spore-producing structures called sporophytes, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, dry, and well-drained environments, often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are narrow, overlapping, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Milium roseum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
