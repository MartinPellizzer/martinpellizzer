<p>Meryta brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed meryta, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
