<p>Maclura tinctoria subvar. lobata, commonly known as the yellow wood or honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a resilient species in woodland and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in dyeing textiles and its ornamental value contribute to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
