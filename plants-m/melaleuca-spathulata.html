                    <h1>Melaleuca spathulata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white and grey underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a greyish-green hue.</p>
<p>Melaleuca spathulata is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
