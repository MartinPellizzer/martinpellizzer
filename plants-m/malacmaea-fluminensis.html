                    <h1>Malacmaea fluminensis</h1>
<p>Malacmaea fluminensis, commonly known as the Amazonian moon snail, is a species of sea snail found in the coastal waters of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Eulimidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body and a spiral shell that is often covered in a calcareous layer. The snail's radula, a ribbon-like structure used for feeding, is adapted for scraping algae and microorganisms from surfaces. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it faces threats to its survival in its native range.</p>
