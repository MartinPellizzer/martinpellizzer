<p>Melampyrum pratense var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate touch-me-not, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its name "touch-me-not" refers to the sticky, glandular hairs on its stems that deter herbivores from feeding on it.</p>
