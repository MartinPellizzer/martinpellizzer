                    <h1>Mariscus umbilensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus umbilensis, commonly known as the umbilical marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of soft, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense mat, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Mariscus umbilensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
