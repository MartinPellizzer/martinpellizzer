                    <h1>Melaleuca striata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, grey, and brown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca striata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
