                    <h1>Microcycas</h1>
<p>Microcycas, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their short, stout trunks and large, feather-like leaves. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Microcycas species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>Their cones, which produce seeds, are an important feature in their reproductive cycle.</p>
