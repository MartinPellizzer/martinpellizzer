<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, violet-blue flowers clustered in loose racemes.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
