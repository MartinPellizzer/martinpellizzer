<p>Mimosa verticillata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Mimosa verticillata is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can make it a useful plant in certain agricultural contexts.</p>
