                    <h1>Mapania johorensis</h1>
<p>Mapania johorensis, commonly known as the Johore mountain fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense forests. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Mapania johorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
