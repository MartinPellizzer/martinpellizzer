<p>Minuartia graminifolia subsp.</p>
<p>clandestina, commonly known as the hidden grassland sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves adapted to water-conserving environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of M. graminifolia. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in disturbed or marginal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
