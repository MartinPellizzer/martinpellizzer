                    <h1>Micranthocereus flaviflorus var. uilianus</h1>
<p>Micranthocereus flaviflorus var. uilianus, commonly known as the Uilianus cactus, is a rare cactus species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
