<p>Macrozamia hopei, commonly known as the Hope's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the male cones bearing pollen and the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Macrozamia hopei is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation laws.</p>
