                    <h1>Marsilea oxaloides</h1>
<p>Marsilea oxaloides, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling the shape of a clover leaf. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Marsilea oxaloides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
