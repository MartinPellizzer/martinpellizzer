                    <h1>Malaxis bahanensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis bahanensis, commonly known as the Bahan's Malaxis, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudo-bulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
