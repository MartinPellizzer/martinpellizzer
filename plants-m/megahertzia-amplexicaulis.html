<p>Megahertzia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, bushy crown. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in cones at the base of the leaves. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
