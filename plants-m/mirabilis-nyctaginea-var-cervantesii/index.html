<p>Cervantes' four-o'clock, scientifically known as Mirabilis nyctaginea var. cervantesii, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Baja California. This unique species belongs to the flowering plant family Mirabilis, which is known for its vibrant and showy blooms. Its name derives from its habit of opening its flowers in the late afternoon, around four o'clock, and closing them at dusk. The plant's delicate pink to purple flowers add a touch of elegance to its desert habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
