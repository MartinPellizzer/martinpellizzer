                    <h1>Misanteca</h1>
<p>Misanteca, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Dendrocnide, which is part of the nettle family, Urticaceae. The plant is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Misanteca is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest.</p>
