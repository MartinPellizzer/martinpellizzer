                    <h1>Melhania praemorsa</h1>
<p>Melhania praemorsa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Melhania praemorsa is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
