<p>Microlepia speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species that thrives in dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear in clusters on rocky surfaces or soil within subterranean habitats. This plant relies on spore propagation and has adapted to low-light conditions through efficient photosynthetic mechanisms. Its rhizomes are typically short and extensively branched, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor cave soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, Microlepia speluncae is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems and is often found in association with other troglophile flora.</p>
