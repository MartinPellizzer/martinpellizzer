                    <h1>Microlepia strigosa</h1>
<p>Microlepia strigosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
