                    <h1>Mougeotia corchorifolia</h1>
<p>Mougeotia corchorifolia, commonly known as the water clover, is a freshwater algae belonging to the order Zygnematales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, ribbon-like thallus that forms a network resembling the leaves of clover. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of filamentous cells that form a dense, green mat on the surface of water. It reproduces through the formation of zoospores, which are released into the water when conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>Mougeotia corchorifolia is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
