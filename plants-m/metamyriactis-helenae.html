                    <h1>Metamyriactis helenae</h1>
<p>Metamyriactis helenae, commonly known as the Helen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to thrive in coastal and semi-arid environments. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
