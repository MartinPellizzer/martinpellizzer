<p>Metathelypteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean brittle fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its fronds are often fragile and may have a soft, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
