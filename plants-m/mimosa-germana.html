                    <h1>Mimosa germana</h1>
<p>Mimosa germana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational purposes.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
