<p>Mimosa asperata var. vermoesenii, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
