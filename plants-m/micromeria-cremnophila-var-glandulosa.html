<p>Micromeria cremnophila var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular micromeria, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete essential oils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and play a role in its adaptation to arid conditions.</p>
