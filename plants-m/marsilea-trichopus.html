<p>Marsilea trichopus, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its small, yellowish flowers are borne on short stalks and are followed by distinctive, four-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>Marsilea trichopus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
