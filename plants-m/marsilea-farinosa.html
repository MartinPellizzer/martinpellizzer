                    <h1>Marsilea farinosa</h1>
<p>Marsilea farinosa, commonly known as the common water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, which are often used as indicators of water quality. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea farinosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
