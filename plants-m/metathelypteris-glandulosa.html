                    <h1>Metathelypteris glandulosa</h1>
<p>Metathelypteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous fronds that are often clustered closely together.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
