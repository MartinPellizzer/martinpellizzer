<p>Microlepia neostrigosa, commonly known as the narrow-stripped water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a fine, wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Microlepia neostrigosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
