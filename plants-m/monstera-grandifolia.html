                    <h1>Monstera grandifolia</h1>
<p>Monstera grandifolia, commonly known as the giant monstera, is a tropical plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop fenestrations as they mature. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The leaves are not only visually striking but also have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
