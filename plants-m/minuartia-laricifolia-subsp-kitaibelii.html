<p>Minuartia laricifolia subsp.</p>
<p>kitaibelii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
