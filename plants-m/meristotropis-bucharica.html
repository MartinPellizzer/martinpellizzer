                    <h1>Meristotropis bucharica</h1>
<p>Meristotropis bucharica, commonly known as the Bukharan meristem, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique meristematic structures that contribute to its unusual growth patterns. The plant exhibits a compact, rosette-like form with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowering stems are short and bear small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Meristotropis bucharica is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
