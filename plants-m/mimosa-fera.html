<p>Mimosa fera, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its small, clustered white flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The rapid leaf movement is a defensive mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress.</p>
