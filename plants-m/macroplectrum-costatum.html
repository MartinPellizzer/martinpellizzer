                    <h1>Macroplectrum costatum</h1>
<p>Macroplectrum costatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>The zigzag fern is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors or rocky outcrops.</p>
