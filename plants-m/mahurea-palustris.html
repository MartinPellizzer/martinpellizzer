                    <h1>Mahurea palustris</h1>
<p>Mahurea palustris, commonly known as the swamp mahurea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, acidic soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and tidal flats. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, blue-green surface. Its flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are often overlooked but are important for pollinators.</p>
<p>Mahurea palustris plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
