                    <h1>Mezoneuron macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Mezoneuron macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy surface that prevents water from penetrating, allowing the plant to thrive in still, shallow waters.</p>
