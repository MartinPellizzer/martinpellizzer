                    <h1>Macrozamia pauli-guilielmi</h1>
<p>Macrozamia pauli-guilielmi, commonly known as the Paul's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes and a target for conservation efforts.</p>
