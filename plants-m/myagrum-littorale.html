                    <h1>Myagrum littorale</h1>
<p>Myagrum littorale, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found growing in sandy or saline soils. Myagrum littorale has adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
