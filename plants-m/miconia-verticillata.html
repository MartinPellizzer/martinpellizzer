                    <h1>Miconia verticillata</h1>
<p>Miconia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, palmate leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
