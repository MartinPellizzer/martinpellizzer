<p>Musa acuminata subsp.</p>
<p>halabanensis, commonly known as the Halaban banana, is a wild banana species native to the island of Halaban in the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It is a member of the Musaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and edible, elongated fruits.</p>
