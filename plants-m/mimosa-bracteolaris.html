                    <h1>Mimosa bracteolaris</h1>
<p>Mimosa bracteolaris, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Mimosa bracteolaris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
