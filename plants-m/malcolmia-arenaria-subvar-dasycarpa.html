                    <h1>Malcolmia arenaria subvar. dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Malcolmia arenaria subvar. dasycarpa, commonly known as the sand malcolm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that are densely hairy, giving it the subspecies name *dasycarpa*, meaning "hairy fruit.". It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wastelands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to dry environments and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
