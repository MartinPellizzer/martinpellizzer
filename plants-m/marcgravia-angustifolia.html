                    <h1>Marcgravia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Marcgravia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Marcgravia angustifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insect species and contributing to the biodiversity of the canopy layers in rainforests.</p>
