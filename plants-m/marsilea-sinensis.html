<p>Marsilea sinensis, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are often used as a decorative element in water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by tiny, greenish fruits.</p>
