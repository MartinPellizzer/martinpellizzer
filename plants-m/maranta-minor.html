                    <h1>Maranta minor</h1>
<p>Maranta minor, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking patterns of red and silver, which become more prominent under low light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Maranta minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes can also be used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly cultivated for this purpose compared to its larger relative, Maranta arundinacea.</p>
