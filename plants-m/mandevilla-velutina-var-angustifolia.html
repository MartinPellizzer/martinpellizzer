                    <h1>Mandevilla velutina var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Mandevilla velutina var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mandevilla, is a tropical vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical mandevilla species. The plant produces clusters of trumpet-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and ample sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
