                    <h1>Menonvillea zuloagaensis</h1>
<p>Menonvillea zuloagaensis, commonly known as the Zuloaga's menonvillea, is a rare bromeliad native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual element. It thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
