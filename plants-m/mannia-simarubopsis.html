<p>Mannia simarubopsis, commonly known as the red-stemmed manna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes grass-like plants and some aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
