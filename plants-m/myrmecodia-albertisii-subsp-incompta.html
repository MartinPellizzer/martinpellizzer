<p>Myrmecodia albertisii subsp.</p>
<p>incompta, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for colonies of ants.</p>
<p>These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient acquisition through their waste. The plant's morphology includes a swollen, bulbous stem covered in a dense layer of root-like structures.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests.</p>
