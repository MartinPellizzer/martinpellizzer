                    <h1>Mestoklema arboriforme</h1>
<p>Mestoklema arboriforme, commonly known as the tree-like mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a branching, tree-like structure, which gives it its common name. The plant possesses chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis, though it also derives nutrients from its host. Its small, white or greenish flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Mestoklema arboriforme plays a role in ecological interactions, supporting bird life and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
