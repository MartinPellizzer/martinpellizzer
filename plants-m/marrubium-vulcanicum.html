                    <h1>Marrubium vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Marrubium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic horehound, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Marrubium vulcanicum is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
