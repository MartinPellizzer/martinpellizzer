<p>Mallotus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny mallot, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The spiny structures on its fruit and stems are adaptations that aid in seed dispersal and protection from herbivores.</p>
