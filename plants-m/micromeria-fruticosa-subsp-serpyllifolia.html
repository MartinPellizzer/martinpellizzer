<p>Micromeria fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>serpyllifolia, commonly known as coastal sand verbena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dune habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
