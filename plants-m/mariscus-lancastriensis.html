                    <h1>Mariscus lancastriensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus lancastriensis, commonly known as the Lancashire marshmallow, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wetlands of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its moist habitat. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated bogs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
