                    <h1>Mimosa pluriracemosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa pluriracemosa, commonly known as the clustered sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or touch stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Mimosa pluriracemosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
