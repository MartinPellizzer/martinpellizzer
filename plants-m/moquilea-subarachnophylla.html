                    <h1>Moquilea subarachnophylla</h1>
<p>Moquilea subarachnophylla, commonly known as the desert lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic composite of a green alga and a cyanobacterium, forming a lichen that can survive in extreme conditions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of the algal and fungal components. It is often found on rocky surfaces or soil in deserts, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Moquilea subarachnophylla is an important indicator of environmental health in harsh ecosystems.</p>
