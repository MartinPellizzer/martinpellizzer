<p>Melampyrum pseudobarbatum, commonly known as the false toadflax, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
