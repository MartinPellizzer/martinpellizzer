                    <h1>Mimosa turneri</h1>
<p>Mimosa turneri, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Mimosa turneri is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
