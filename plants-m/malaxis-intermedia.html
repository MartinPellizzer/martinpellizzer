<p>Malaxis intermedia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green or white, strap-like leaves and its elongated, pendulous flower spikes that bear small, delicate flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
