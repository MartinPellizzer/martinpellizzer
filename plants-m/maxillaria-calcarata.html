                    <h1>Maxillaria calcarata</h1>
<p>Maxillaria calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts its primary pollinatorsâ€”small flies. Its flowers are typically yellow with red or purple markings, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Maxillaria calcarata is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
