<p>Microstylis undulata, commonly known as the wavy-styled fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, wavy-margined fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including small spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Microstylis undulata is often considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
