<p>Mapania afroorientalis, commonly known as the African oriental maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically consist of five to seven lobes, and its small, clustered flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces samaroid fruits, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
