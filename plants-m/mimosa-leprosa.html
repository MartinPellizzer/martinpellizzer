                    <h1>Mimosa leprosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa leprosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Mimosa leprosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance.</p>
