                    <h1>Myristica carrii</h1>
<p>Myristica carrii, commonly known as the Carrii nutmeg, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops large, oblong fruits that contain the valuable seeds. Myristica carrii is closely related to the well-known nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) but is less commercially cultivated.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
