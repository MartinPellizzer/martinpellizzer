                    <h1>Moquinia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Moquinia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly moquinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Moquinia tomentosa is often found in still or slow-moving water environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
