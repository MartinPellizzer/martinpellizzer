                    <h1>Micranthes nelsoniana var. cascadensis</h1>
<p>Micranthes nelsoniana var. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade micranthes, is a rare alpine plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its rugged habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for alpine ecosystem health.</p>
