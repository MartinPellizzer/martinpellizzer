                    <h1>Mimosa nuda var. gracilipes</h1>
<p>Mimosa nuda var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender sensitive plant, is a delicate herbaceous species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its slender stems and hairy leaves make it easily distinguishable from other mimosa species.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
