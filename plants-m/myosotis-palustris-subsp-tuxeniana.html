<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>tuxeniana, commonly known as the marsh forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as bogs and damp meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
