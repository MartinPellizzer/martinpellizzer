                    <h1>Melocactus pyramidalis var. compressus</h1>
<p>Melocactus pyramidalis var. compressus, commonly known as the compressed pyramidal cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, ribbed stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
