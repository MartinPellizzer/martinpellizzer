                    <h1>Melhania rehmannii</h1>
<p>Melhania rehmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat.</p>
