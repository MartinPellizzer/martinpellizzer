<p>Mesembryanthemum surrectum, commonly known as the "ice plant," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the early morning. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum surrectum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
