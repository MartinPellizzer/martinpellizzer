<p>Miconia aubletiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia aubletiana is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
