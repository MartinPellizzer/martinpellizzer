                    <h1>Mollugo pusilla</h1>
<p>Mollugo pusilla, commonly known as carpetweed, is a small, annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along paths.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a persistent weed in cultivated areas.</p>
