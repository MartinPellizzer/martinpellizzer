                    <h1>Menziesia lasiophylla var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Menziesia lasiophylla var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored menziesia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that exhibit a striking two-color pattern, typically green on the upper surface and silver-white on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, scale-like structures that provide a velvety texture and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
