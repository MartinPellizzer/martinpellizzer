<p>Microsorum neglectum, commonly known as the neglected water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while spreading along the bottom of water bodies.</p>
<p>Microsorum neglectum is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
