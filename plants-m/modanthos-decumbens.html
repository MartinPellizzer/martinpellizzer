<p>Modanthos decumbens, commonly known as the creeping rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
