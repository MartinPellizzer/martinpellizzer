                    <h1>Mentha × verticillata var. moenchiana</h1>
<p>Mentha × verticillata var. moenchiana, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of menthol and other volatile oils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potential weed.</p>
