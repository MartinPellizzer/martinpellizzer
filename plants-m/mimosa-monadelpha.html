                    <h1>Mimosa monadelpha</h1>
<p>Mimosa monadelpha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa monadelpha is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
