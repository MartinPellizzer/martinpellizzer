                    <h1>Microlophus cerinthifolius</h1>
<p>Microlophus cerinthifolius, commonly known as the desert spiny lizard plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Microlophus cerinthifolius is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
