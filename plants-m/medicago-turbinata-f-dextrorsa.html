                    <h1>Medicago turbinata f. dextrorsa</h1>
<p>Medicago turbinata f. dextrorsa, commonly known as the right-facing sickle vetch, is a variant of the sickle vetch species characterized by its distinctive rightward-curving seed pods.</p>
<p>This plant is a legume native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a serrated edge, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The seed pods are tightly coiled and spiral in a clockwise direction, a unique feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
