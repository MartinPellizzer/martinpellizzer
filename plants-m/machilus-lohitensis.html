<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
