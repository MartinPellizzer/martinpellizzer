<p>Mazus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, slightly hairy, and emit a mild, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Mazus japonicus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
