<p>Microlicia pusillifolia, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of hardwood trees, particularly oaks and hickories, and relies on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are scale-like and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of mistletoe species.</p>
<p>Microlicia pusillifolia plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
