<p>Mezia rufa, commonly known as the red meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Mezia rufa is also valued for its role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems.</p>
