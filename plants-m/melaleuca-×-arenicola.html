                    <h1>Melaleuca × arenicola</h1>
<p>Melaleuca × arenicola, commonly known as the coastal melaleuca, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey-green bark and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Melaleuca × arenicola is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>
