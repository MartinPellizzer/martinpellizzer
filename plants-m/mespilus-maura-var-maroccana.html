<p>Mespilus maura var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan medlar, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the medlar plant.</p>
<p>It is native to North Africa, particularly Morocco, and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature, though they may have a short shelf life. Its botanical characteristics include a shrub or small tree form with greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, and the fruit has a unique, slightly astringent flavor.</p>
