<p>Microsorum tenuilore, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The plant's small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats.</p>
