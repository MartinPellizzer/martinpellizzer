<p>Microsorum henryi, commonly known as the Henry's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in water purification.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
