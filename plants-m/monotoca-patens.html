                    <h1>Monotoca patens</h1>
<p>Monotoca patens, commonly known as the slender tamarisk, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Monotoca patens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry washes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
