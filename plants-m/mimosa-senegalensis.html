                    <h1>Mimosa senegalensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa senegalensis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a shrub native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the plant cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Mimosa senegalensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil enrichment.</p>
