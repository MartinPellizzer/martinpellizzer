<p>Mimosa biuncifera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in ion flow and turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Mimosa biuncifera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
