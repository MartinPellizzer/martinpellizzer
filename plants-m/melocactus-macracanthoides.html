<p>Melocactus macracanthoides, commonly known as the large-armed melon cactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of thick, ribbed, spiny segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its dense, waxy coating helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment.</p>
<p>Melocactus macracanthoides is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
