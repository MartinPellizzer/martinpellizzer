<p>Maerua flagellaris subsp.</p>
<p>crustata, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it useful for erosion control and as a source of food in certain regions.</p>
