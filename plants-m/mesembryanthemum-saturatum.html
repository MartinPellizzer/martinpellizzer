<p>Mesembryanthemum saturatum, commonly known as the blue ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
