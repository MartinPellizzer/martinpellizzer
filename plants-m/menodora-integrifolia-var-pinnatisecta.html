<p>Menodora integrifolia var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are typically hairy, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with finely serrated edges.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more finely divided leaf structure compared to the typical form of Menodora integrifolia.</p>
