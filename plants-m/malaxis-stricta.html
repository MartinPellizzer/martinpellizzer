<p>Malaxis stricta, commonly known as the rigid malaxis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers.
