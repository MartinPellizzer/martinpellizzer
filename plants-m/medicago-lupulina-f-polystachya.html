                    <h1>Medicago lupulina f. polystachya</h1>
<p>Medicago lupulina f. polystachya, commonly known as the polystachya form of yellow sweet clover, is a botanical variant of the yellow sweet clover species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, multi-branched inflorescences, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. This form is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility.</p>
