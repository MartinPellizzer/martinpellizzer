<p>Mimosa nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Mimosa nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>
