                    <h1>Musa × formobisiana</h1>
<p>Musa × formobisiana, commonly known as the banana hybrid, is a cultivated variety resulting from crossbreeding between different banana species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of fruit that typically mature to a yellow color. The plant is a member of the Musaceae family and is primarily grown for its edible fruit. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is often used in breeding programs to develop disease-resistant banana varieties.</p>
