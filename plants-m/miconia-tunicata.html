                    <h1>Miconia tunicata</h1>
<p>Miconia tunicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia tunicata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
