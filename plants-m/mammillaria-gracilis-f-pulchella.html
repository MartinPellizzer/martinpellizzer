<p>Mammillaria gracilis f. pulchella, commonly known as the elegant mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to the rocky soils of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is slow, making it suitable for small spaces and container gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it requires careful handling and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
