<p>Moniera diffusa, commonly known as the spreading fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes Moniera diffusa a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
