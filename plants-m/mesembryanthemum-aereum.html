                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum aereum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum aereum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in arid and coastal environments due to its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It is often used in xeriscaping because of its low water requirements and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
