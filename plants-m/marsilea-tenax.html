                    <h1>Marsilea tenax</h1>
<p>Marsilea tenax, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, and it produces tiny, floating spores that aid in its reproduction. The plant is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can influence water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Marsilea tenax is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and support biodiversity.</p>
