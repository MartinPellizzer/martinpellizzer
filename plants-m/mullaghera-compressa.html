                    <h1>Mullaghera compressa</h1>
<p>Mullaghera compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mullagh, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms a low-growing, mat-like structure. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
