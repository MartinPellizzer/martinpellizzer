                    <h1>Moniera lanigera</h1>
<p>Moniera lanigera, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular, and often hairy stems that aid in trapping prey. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its leaves are modified into bladder-like structures that can inflate to capture small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Moniera lanigera relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
