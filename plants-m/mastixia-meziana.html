                    <h1>Mastixia meziana</h1>
<p>Mastixia meziana, commonly known as the mountain mastix, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's unique feature is its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
