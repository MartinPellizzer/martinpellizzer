<p>Meconopsis impedita subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as the red Himalayan poppy, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive blue or purple sepals, which contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the mountainous landscape.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
