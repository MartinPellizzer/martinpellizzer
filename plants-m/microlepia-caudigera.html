                    <h1>Microlepia caudigera</h1>
<p>Microlepia caudigera, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that often have a trailing or creeping growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, while the spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Microlepia caudigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens.</p>
