<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. lunaris, commonly known as the Moon Banana, is a unique variant of the banana plant characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers.</p>

The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with large, broad leaves that can reach several feet in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is often focused on its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>
