<p>Medicago difalcata subsp.</p>
<p>kazachstanica, commonly known as Kazakh clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
