                    <h1>Malapoenna firma</h1>
<p>Malapoenna firma, commonly known as the Malapoenna fir, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and high UV radiation. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soil and access limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Malapoenna firma is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
