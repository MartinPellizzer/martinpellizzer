                    <h1>Metastelma infimicola</h1>
<p>Metastelma infimicola, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, white or pale green berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both a seedling stage and a mature stage, with the seeds being dispersed by birds that feed on its berries.</p>
