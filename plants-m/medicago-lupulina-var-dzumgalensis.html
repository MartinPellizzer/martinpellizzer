<p>Medicago lupulina var. dzumgalensis, commonly known as the Dzumgalensis goatweed, is a rare and endemic legume native to specific regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
