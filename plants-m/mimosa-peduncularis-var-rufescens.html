<p>Mimosa peduncularis var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and trifoliate leaves that fold shut when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening.</p>
