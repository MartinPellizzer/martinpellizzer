                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader and more lobed compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
