<p>Megastachya brizoides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, blue-purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
