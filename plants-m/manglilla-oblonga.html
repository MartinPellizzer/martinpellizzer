<p>Manglilla oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody structure and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by fruiting bodies that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Manglilla oblonga plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
