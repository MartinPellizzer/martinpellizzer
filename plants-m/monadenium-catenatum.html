<p>Monadenium catenatum, commonly known as the chain grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in disturbed or marginal habitats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Monadenium catenatum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
