                    <h1>Microtea maypurensis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Microtea maypurensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf microtea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
