                    <h1>Miconia flammea</h1>
<p>Miconia flammea, commonly known as the flame miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves used to attract pollinators. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common invader in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
