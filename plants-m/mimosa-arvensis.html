                    <h1>Mimosa arvensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa arvensis, commonly known as the common mimosa, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response mediated by sensitive cells in the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Mimosa arvensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
