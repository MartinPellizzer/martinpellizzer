                    <h1>Mesanthemum</h1>
<p>Mesanthemum, commonly known as the "white crown" or "white star," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. Mesanthemum species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xerophytic conditions. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
