                    <h1>Monotoca scoparia var. submutica</h1>
<p>Monotoca scoparia var. submutica, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
