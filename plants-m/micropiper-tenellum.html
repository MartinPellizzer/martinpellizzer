<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family, characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that resemble small pipes. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, fragrant blossoms that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are thin and vine-like.</p>
