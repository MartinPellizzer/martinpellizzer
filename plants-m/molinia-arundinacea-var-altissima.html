                    <h1>Molinia arundinacea var. altissima</h1>
<p>Molinia arundinacea var. altissima, commonly known as tall moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to golden yellow seed heads that are highly visible during the late summer and early autumn. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
