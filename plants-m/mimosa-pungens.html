                    <h1>Mimosa pungens</h1>
<p>Mimosa pungens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for both horticulture and botanical study.</p>
