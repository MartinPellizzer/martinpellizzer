<p>Mammillaria thornberi var. yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquensis Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny tubercles that give it a distinctive, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, slender stems. Its fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
