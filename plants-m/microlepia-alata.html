                    <h1>Microlepia alata</h1>
<p>Microlepia alata, commonly known as the flying fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or rolled when young. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
