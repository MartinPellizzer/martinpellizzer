                    <h1>Medicago glutinosa var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Medicago glutinosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as sticky medick, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
