                    <h1>Mimosa pernambucana</h1>
<p>Mimosa pernambucana, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer, followed by fluffy, pale pink seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and environmental stimuli makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
