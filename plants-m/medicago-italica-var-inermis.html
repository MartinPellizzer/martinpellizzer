<p>Medicago italica var. inermis, commonly known as the slender Medicago, is a low-growing annual legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with slender stipules and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is used in some ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
