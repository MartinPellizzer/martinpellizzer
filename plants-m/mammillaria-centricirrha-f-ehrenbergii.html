                    <h1>Mammillaria centricirrha f. ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria centricirrha f. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's clustered mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant features a short, thick stem with areoles that bear clusters of radial spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
