<p>Malus communis subsp.</p>
<p>pumila, commonly known as the dwarf apple, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2â€“3 meters, with a rounded crown and spreading branches.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow-green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall, and it bears small, apple-like fruits that are typically sour and not commonly eaten by humans. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is closely related to the domesticated apple, but it has retained more primitive characteristics.</p>
