                    <h1>Mesterna</h1>
<p>Mesterna, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on aerial roots to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, mesterna is considered an endangered species.</p>
