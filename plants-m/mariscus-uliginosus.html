<p>Mariscus uliginosus, commonly known as the bog myrtle, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in northern Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens.</p>
<p>Mariscus uliginosus has been historically used for its medicinal properties and in the production of smoking materials.</p>
