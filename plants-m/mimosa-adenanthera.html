                    <h1>Mimosa adenanthera</h1>
<p>Mimosa adenanthera, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, ball-shaped flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa adenanthera is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and reforestation efforts.</p>
