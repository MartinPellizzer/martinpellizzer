<p>Mammillaria aureilanata f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a rare and striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in short, white spines and is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's foliage is typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
