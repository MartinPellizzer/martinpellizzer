                    <h1>Metastelma brachymischum</h1>
<p>Metastelma brachymischum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Myrtaceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
