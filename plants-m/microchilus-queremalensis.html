<p>Microchilus queremalensis, commonly known as the Queremal mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short stem and a single, broad leaf that supports its flowering structure. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor, rocky soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
