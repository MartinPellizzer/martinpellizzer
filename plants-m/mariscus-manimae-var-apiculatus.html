The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a slight hairy texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
