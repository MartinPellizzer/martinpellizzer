                    <h1>Mitrasacme geniculosa</h1>
<p>Mitrasacme geniculosa, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive branching pattern with a zigzag appearance, which is characteristic of its genus. The plant possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to extract water and nutrients from its host. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and red berries that are often dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
