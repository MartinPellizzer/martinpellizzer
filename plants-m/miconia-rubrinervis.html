                    <h1>Miconia rubrinervis</h1>
<p>Miconia rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia rubrinervis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
