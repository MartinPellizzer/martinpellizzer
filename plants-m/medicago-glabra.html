                    <h1>Medicago glabra</h1>
<p>Medicago glabra, commonly known as the smooth medick, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional value and palatability.</p>
<p>Medicago glabra also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
