                    <h1>Myrmecodendron</h1>
<p>Myrmecodendron, commonly known as the ant plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique relationship with ants, as they provide shelter and food for various ant species. The leaves of Myrmecodendron often have specialized structures called domatia, which serve as housing for the ants. The plant's growth is closely tied to the presence of these ants, which in turn help protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
<p>Myrmecodendron species are primarily found in tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
