                    <h1>Malachra fasciata</h1>
<p>Malachra fasciata, commonly known as the spotted milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Malachra fasciata is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
