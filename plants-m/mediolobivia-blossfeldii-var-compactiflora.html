<p>Mediolobivia blossfeldii var. compactiflora, commonly known as the compact-flowered lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered closely together on the stems. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions with minimal care.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
