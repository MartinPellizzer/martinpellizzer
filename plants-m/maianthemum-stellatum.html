<p>Maianthemum stellatum, commonly known as star-flower or white star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Maianthemum stellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
