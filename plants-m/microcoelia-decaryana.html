<p>Microcoelia decaryana, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive flowering spike, which bears small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microcoelia decaryana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
