<p>Maianthemum racemosum subsp.</p>
<p>racemosum, commonly known as the clustered false lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact colonies in shaded woodland environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies racemosum is distinguished by its elongated, racemose inflorescence, which sets it apart from other subspecies within the Maianthemum genus.</p>
