<p>Mesosetum elegans, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Mesosetum elegans is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
