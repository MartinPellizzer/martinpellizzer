                    <h1>Mimosa oligacantha</h1>
<p>Mimosa oligacantha, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its unique physiological response and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>
