                    <h1>Massonia triflora</h1>
<p>Massonia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered massonia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
