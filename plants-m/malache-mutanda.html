<p>Malache mutanda, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. Malache mutanda thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
