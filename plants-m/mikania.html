                    <h1>Mikania</h1>
<p>Mikania, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of over 50 species, most of which are native to the Americas. These plants are typically herbaceous, with opposite leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. They often grow in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, and can form dense stands.</p>
<p>Mikania species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
