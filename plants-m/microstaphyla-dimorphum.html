                    <h1>Microstaphyla dimorphum</h1>
<p>Microstaphyla dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, with two distinct forms of leaves depending on its growth position. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to southern Africa and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
