                    <h1>Mimosa podocarpa var. acutiflora</h1>
<p>Mimosa podocarpa var. acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by light or mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems.</p>
