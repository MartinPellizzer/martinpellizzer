                    <h1>Myristica bifurcata</h1>
<p>Myristica bifurcata, commonly known as the two-branched nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its seeds are valued for their aromatic properties, similar to nutmeg, though less commercially significant than its relative, Myristica fragrans.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>
