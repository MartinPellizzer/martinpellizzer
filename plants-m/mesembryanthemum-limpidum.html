                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum limpidum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum limpidum, commonly known as the transparent ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
