<p>Malaxis lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
