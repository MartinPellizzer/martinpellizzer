The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
