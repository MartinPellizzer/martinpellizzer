<p>Myrcianthes borealis, commonly known as the Arctic myrcianthe, is a rare shrub native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in extreme cold. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens in early autumn.</p>
<p>Myrcianthes borealis plays an important ecological role in its harsh environment, providing food for local wildlife.</p>
