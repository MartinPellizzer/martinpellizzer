                    <h1>Miconia quinquenodis</h1>
<p>Miconia quinquenodis, commonly known as the five-lobed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by dark purple, fleshy fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for ecosystem management.</p>
