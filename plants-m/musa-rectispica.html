                    <h1>Musa rectispica</h1>
<p>Musa rectispica, commonly known as the straight-spined banana, is a species of banana plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender pseudostem and broad, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into elongated, curved fruits. Its unique spined structure on the fruit set it apart from other banana species.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for food due to its tough, fibrous fruits.</p>
