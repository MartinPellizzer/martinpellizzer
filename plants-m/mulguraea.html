                    <h1>Mulguraea</h1>
<p>Mulguraea, commonly known as the mulga or *Acacia aneura*, is a hardy shrub or tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Mulguraea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various native animals.</p>
