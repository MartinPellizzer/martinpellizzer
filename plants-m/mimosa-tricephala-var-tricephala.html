                    <h1>Mimosa tricephala var. tricephala</h1>
<p>Mimosa tricephala var. tricephala, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its unique morphological features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and scientific study.</p>
