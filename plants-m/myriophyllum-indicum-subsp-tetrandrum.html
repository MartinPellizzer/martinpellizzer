<p>Myriophyllum indicum subsp.</p>
<p>tetrandrum, commonly known as Indian watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which emerge from the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
