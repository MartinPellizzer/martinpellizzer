<p>Microchilus xystophyllus, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color, blooming during the rainy season. Its stems are often woody and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Microchilus xystophyllus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils.</p>
