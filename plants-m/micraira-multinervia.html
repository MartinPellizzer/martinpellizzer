                    <h1>Micraira multinervia</h1>
<p>Micraira multinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive network of veins, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruit production.</p>
