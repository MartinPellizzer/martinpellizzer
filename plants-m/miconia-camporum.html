<p>Miconia camporum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red miconia, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits.
