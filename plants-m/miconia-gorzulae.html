                    <h1>Miconia gorzulae</h1>
<p>Miconia gorzulae, commonly known as the Brazilian starleaf, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
