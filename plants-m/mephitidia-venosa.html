                    <h1>Mephitidia venosa</h1>
<p>Mephitidia venosa, commonly known as the venomous mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Its flowers produce a mild neurotoxin that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Mephitidia venosa is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection for medicinal use.</p>
