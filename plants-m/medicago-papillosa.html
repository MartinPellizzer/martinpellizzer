<p>Medicago papillosa, commonly known as the silky medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silky texture, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
