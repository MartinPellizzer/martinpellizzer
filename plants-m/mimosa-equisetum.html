                    <h1>Mimosa equisetum</h1>
<p>Mimosa equisetum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa equisetum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and attractive foliage.</p>
