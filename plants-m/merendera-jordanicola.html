                    <h1>Merendera jordanicola</h1>
<p>Merendera jordanicola, commonly known as the Jordanian merendera, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Jordan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, pale yellow color that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Merendera jordanicola is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
