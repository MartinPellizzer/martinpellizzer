<p>Macrocnemum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bladderworts, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant's root system is adapted for anchoring in soft, waterlogged soils and absorbing nutrients from its prey.</p>
