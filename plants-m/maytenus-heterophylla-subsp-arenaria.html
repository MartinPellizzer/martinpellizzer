<p>arenaria, commonly known as the desert mayten, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its structure and physiology make it well-suited for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
