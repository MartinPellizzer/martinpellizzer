                    <h1>Musa × sapientum var. sanguinea</h1>
<p>Musa × sapientum var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant characterized by its striking red to purple peel.</p>
<p>This variety is a hybrid of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, resulting in a unique genetic composition. The fruit is typically smaller than the common Cavendish banana, with a sweet, slightly tangy flavor. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in potassium and vitamin C.</p>
