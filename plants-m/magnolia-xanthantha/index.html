                            <h1>Magnolia Xanthantha</h1>
<p>Magnolia xanthantha is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. Known for its vibrant yellow flowers, it stands out among the more commonly found white or pink magnolias. This species is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and unique coloration. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its cultivation in botanical gardens and nurseries helps preserve its genetic diversity and promote awareness of its ecological importance.</p>
