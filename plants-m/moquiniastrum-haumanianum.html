<p>Moquiniastrum haumanianum, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Moquiniastrum haumanianum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
