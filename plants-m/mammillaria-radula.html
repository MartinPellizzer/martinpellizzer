                    <h1>Mammillaria radula</h1>
<p>Mammillaria radula, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often grown in containers to protect it from extreme weather conditions.</p>
