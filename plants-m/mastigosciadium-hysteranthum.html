<p>Mastigosciadium hysteranthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that appear almost ethereal in sunlight. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white and violet, with a peculiar, almost skeletal structure. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Mastigosciadium hysteranthum is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
