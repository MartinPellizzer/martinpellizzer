                    <h1>Microlepia × intramarginalis</h1>
<p>Microlepia × intramarginalis, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Microlepia miquelii and Microlepia pteropus.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
