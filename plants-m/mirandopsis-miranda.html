<p>Mirandopsis miranda, commonly known as the Miranda's bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and tubular corollas. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mirandopsis miranda is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
