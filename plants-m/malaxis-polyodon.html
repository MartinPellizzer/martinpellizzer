                    <h1>Malaxis polyodon</h1>
<p>Malaxis polyodon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Malaxis polyodon is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
