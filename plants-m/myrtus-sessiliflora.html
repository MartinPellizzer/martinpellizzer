                    <h1>Myrtus sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Myrtus sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments.</p>
<p>Myrtus sessiliflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
