<p>Mesembryanthemum capornii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or oro blanco, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, which resembles a small, round tomato, is edible and has a tangy, slightly sweet flavor.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum capornii is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
