<p>Mesembryanthemum displosum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and coastal environments, often growing on rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its fleshy leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum displosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and vibrant blooms.</p>
