                    <h1>Meiogyne hainanensis</h1>
<p>Meiogyne hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Meiogyne hainanensis is a slow-growing species that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
