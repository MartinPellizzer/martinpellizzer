                    <h1>Monanthes anagensis</h1>
<p>Monanthes anagensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its unique, small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the orchid family. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Monanthes anagensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
