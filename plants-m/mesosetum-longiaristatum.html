                    <h1>Mesosetum longiaristatum</h1>
<p>Mesosetum longiaristatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands in prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Mesosetum longiaristatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
