                    <h1>Manihot pseudopruinosa</h1>
<p>Manihot pseudopruinosa, commonly known as the rough manioc, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its latex, like that of other manioc species, contains toxic compounds and requires careful processing before use.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its starchy roots, which are a food source in some regions.</p>
