                    <h1>Musa × sapientum var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Musa × sapientum var. glaberrima, commonly known as the wild banana, is a botanical variant of the banana plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, elongated, and often pointed leaves, which are typically more robust than those of cultivated bananas. The plant produces clustered, elongated fruits that are generally smaller and less sweet compared to commercial bananas. It has a fibrous, starchy pulp and is often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines.</p>
<p>This variety is considered a precursor to many modern banana cultivars and is valued for its genetic diversity.</p>
