                    <h1>Miconia collatata</h1>
<p>Miconia collatata, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
