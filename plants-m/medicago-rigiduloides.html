                    <h1>Medicago rigiduloides</h1>
<p>Medicago rigiduloides, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and degraded rangelands.</p>
<p>Medicago rigiduloides plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
