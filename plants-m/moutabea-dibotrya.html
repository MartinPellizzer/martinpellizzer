                    <h1>Moutabea dibotrya</h1>
<p>Moutabea dibotrya, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, Moutabea dibotrya is considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>
