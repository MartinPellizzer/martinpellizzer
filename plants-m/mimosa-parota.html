                    <h1>Mimosa parota</h1>
<p>Mimosa parota, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. Its stems are woody and often branched, with a tendency to root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Mimosa parota thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
