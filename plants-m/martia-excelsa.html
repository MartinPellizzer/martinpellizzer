<p>Martia excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its enormous, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves have a unique waxy coating that helps repel water and support the weight of small animals.</p>
<p>Martia excelsa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
