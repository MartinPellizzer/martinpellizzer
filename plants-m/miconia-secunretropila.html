<p>Miconia secunretropila, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia secunretropila is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
