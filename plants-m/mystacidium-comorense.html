<p>Mystacidium comorense, commonly known as the Comoros mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Rhus*. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. Its small, elliptical leaves are usually evergreen, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Mystacidium comorense plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
