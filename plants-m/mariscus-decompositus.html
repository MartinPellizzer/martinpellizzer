<p>Mariscus decompositus, commonly known as the decomposing marsh plant, is a rare and delicate species native to specific wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thread-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted for aquatic pollination. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in low-oxygen environments, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mariscus decompositus is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
