                    <h1>Methorium canum</h1>
<p>Methorium canum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a succulent, branching stem covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The leaves are typically narrow, opposite, and have a distinctive silver or grayish-green color due to the same reflective coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
