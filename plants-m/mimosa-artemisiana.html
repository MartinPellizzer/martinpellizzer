                    <h1>Mimosa artemisiana</h1>
<p>Mimosa artemisiana, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa artemisiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
