                    <h1>Masdevallia vidua</h1>
<p>Masdevallia vidua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling the shape of a ghost or spirit. It has a unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
