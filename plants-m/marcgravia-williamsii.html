<p>Marcgravia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams's climbing plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, pinkish-white flowers clustered together. Its climbing habit is supported by aerial roots that allow it to attach to tree trunks and other vertical structures.</p>
<p>Marcgravia williamsii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bats and hummingbirds.</p>
