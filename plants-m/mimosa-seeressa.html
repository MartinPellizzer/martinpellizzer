                    <h1>Mimosa seeressa</h1>
<p>Mimosa seeressa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
