                    <h1>Megastachya hypnoides</h1>
<p>Megastachya hypnoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the branches of trees in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
