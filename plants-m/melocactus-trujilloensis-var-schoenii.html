                    <h1>Melocactus trujilloensis var. schoenii</h1>
<p>Melocactus trujilloensis var. schoenii, commonly known as the Trujillo's melon cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of central Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, typically in the morning. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
