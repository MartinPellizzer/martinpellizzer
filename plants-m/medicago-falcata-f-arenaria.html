                    <h1>Medicago falcata f. arenaria</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand clover, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in poor, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland agriculture.</p>
