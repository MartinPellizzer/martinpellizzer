                    <h1>Megadenus palustris</h1>
<p>Megadenus palustris, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
