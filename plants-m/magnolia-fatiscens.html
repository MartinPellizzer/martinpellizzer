                    <h1>Magnolia fatiscens</h1>
<p>Magnolia fatiscens, commonly known as the Chinese magnolia or the fat-leaf magnolia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a glossy texture, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense, rounded canopy.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks, though it requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun.</p>
