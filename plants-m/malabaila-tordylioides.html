                    <h1>Malabaila tordylioides</h1>
<p>Malabaila tordylioides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered in dense groups, and its flowers are typically white or yellow, with a sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis through its own leaves.</p>
