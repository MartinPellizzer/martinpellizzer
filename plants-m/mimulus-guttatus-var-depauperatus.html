                    <h1>Mimulus guttatus var. depauperatus</h1>
<p>Mimulus guttatus var. depauperatus, commonly known as the poorflower, is a variant of the common monkeyflower.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its reduced floral structures compared to the typical species. The plant typically has slender stems and small, often pale or yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited floral display, it is less showy than other Mimulus species but still plays a role in pollinator interactions.</p>
