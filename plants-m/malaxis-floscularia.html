                    <h1>Malaxis floscularia</h1>
<p>Malaxis floscularia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has long, slender stems and produces clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble small, ghostly shapes. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
