                    <h1>Minuartia setacea var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Minuartia setacea var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are linear, often hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which may produce sticky secretions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
