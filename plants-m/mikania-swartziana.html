<p>Mikania swartziana, commonly known as the climbing Mikania, is a vigorous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in some areas.</p>
