                    <h1>Metastelma penicillatum var. brachystephanum</h1>
<p>Metastelma penicillatum var. brachystephanum, commonly known as the short-step horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, spirally twisted petals and a distinctive, horn-like spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce showy, colorful flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
