                    <h1>Madaractis metziana</h1>
<p>Madaractis metziana, commonly known as the Metziana lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose or areolate thallus on rock surfaces. The plant's symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium allows it to thrive in harsh environments. It is typically found in temperate and subarctic regions, often on bark, soil, or stone.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
