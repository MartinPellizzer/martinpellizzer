                    <h1>Myriadenus echinocarpus</h1>
<p>Myriadenus echinocarpus, commonly known as the spiny burr vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, spiny, three-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by three-winged, spiny fruits. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted for dispersal by animals that brush against the spiny fruits.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
