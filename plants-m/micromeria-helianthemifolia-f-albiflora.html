                    <h1>Micromeria helianthemifolia f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Micromeria helianthemifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical form of Micromeria helianthemifolia.</p>
