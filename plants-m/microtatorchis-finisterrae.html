                    <h1>Microtatorchis finisterrae</h1>
<p>Microtatorchis finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands dwarf orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, fleshy leaves that help it survive in the dry, volcanic soils of its native habitat. It is adapted to the unique microclimate of the island's high-altitude regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
