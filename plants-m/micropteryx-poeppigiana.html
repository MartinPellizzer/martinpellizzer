<p>Micropteryx poeppigiana, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
