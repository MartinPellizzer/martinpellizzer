<p>Medicago minima subsp.</p>
<p>pulchella, commonly known as the slender medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, yellow flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils and makes it a valuable pioneer species in disturbed habitats. It is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules contributes to soil fertility and ecological resilience.</p>
