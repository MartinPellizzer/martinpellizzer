                    <h1>Manilkara inundata</h1>
<p>Manilkara inundata, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after timber species.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
