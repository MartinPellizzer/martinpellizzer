<p>Monotoca glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy, blue-violet flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. Monotoca glauca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Monotoca glauca has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age.
