                    <h1>Mecardonia procumbens var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Mecardonia procumbens var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping mecardonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species for xerophytic habitats.</p>
