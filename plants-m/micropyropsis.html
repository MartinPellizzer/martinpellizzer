                    <h1>Micropyropsis</h1>
<p>Micropyropsis, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Micropyropsis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
