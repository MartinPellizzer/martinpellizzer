                    <h1>Mimosa paradoxa</h1>
<p>Mimosa paradoxa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa paradoxa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and aesthetic appeal.</p>
