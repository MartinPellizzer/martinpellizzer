<p>Minuartia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss and a compact growth habit that minimizes exposure to wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
