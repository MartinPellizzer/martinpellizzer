                    <h1>Monogramma rudolfii</h1>
<p>Monogramma rudolfii, commonly known as the Rudolf's rockcap, is a rare and striking fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided, bright green fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monogramma rudolfii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
