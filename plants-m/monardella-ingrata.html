<p>Monardella ingrata, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Monardella ingrata is also valued for its nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees.</p>
