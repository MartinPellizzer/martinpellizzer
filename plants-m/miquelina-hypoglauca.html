<p>Miquelina hypoglauca, commonly known as the blue-green miquelina, is a rare and distinctive member of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale blue to greenish-white. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a unique waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
