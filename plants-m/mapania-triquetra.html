<p>Mapania triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its reproductive structures, including gemmae, are often found on the surface of the thallus, allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Mapania triquetra is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist ecosystems.</p>
