<p>Maharanga egregia, commonly known as the sacred flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a robust, woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that provides a textured appearance. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The maharanga egregia is not only valued for its ornamental beauty but also holds cultural significance in many island communities.</p>
