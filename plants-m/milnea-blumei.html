                    <h1>Milnea blumei</h1>
<p>Milnea blumei, commonly known as Blume's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>Milnea blumei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
