<p>Macaranga subfalcata, commonly known as the broadleaf paper plant, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by capsules that release numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its leaves are used in traditional papermaking due to their fibrous structure.</p>
