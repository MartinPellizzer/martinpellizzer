<p>Mammillaria rhodantha var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Milk Barrel Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of white, radial spines and is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which bloom from areoles located near the top of the stem. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
