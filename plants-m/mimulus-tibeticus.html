                    <h1>Mimulus tibeticus</h1>
<p>Mimulus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which resemble the shape of a monkey's face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Mimulus tibeticus plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
