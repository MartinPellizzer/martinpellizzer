                    <h1>Monopteris guianensis</h1>
<p>Monopteris guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan shield fern, is a tropical fern native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in humid, warm climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in M. guianensis.</p>
