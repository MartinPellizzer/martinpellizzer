                    <h1>Mediolobivia pygmaea var. flavovirens</h1>
<p>Mediolobivia pygmaea var. flavovirens, commonly known as the golden-green dwarf lobivia, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many desert plants, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
