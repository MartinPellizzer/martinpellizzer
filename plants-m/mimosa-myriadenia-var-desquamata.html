                    <h1>Mimosa myriadenia var. desquamata</h1>
<p>Mimosa myriadenia var. desquamata, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are often covered in a flaky, papery layer that peels away as the plant matures.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
