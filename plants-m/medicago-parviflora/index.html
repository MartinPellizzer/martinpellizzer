                            <h1>Medicago Parviflora</h1>
<p>Medicago parviflora, commonly known as small-flower medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. This plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a valuable role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration. Its resilience and adaptability make it a useful species for both horticultural and environmental applications.</p>
