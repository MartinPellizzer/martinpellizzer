                    <h1>Mimosa purpurea</h1>
<p>Mimosa purpurea, commonly known as the pink mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
