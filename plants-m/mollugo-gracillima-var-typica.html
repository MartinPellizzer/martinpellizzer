                    <h1>Mollugo gracillima var. typica</h1>
<p>Mollugo gracillima var. typica, commonly known as the slender mossy weed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it a common sight in humid climates.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
