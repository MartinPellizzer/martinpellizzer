<p>Mespilus tanacetifolia subvar. tournefortii, commonly known as the Turkish medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of the yarrow plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, round, apple-like fruits that ripen in autumn. The fruit has a firm, bony core and is typically harvested when it is fully mature and slightly soft.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
