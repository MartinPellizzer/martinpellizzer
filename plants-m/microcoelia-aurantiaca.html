                    <h1>Microcoelia aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Microcoelia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange star moss, is a type of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish sporangia that are clustered in distinctive, cup-shaped structures called sorangia. Microcoelia aurantiaca is typically found on rock surfaces or in damp soil, often in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
