                    <h1>Miconia procera</h1>
<p>Miconia procera, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a large shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that resembles a small, fleshy berry. Miconia procera is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can dominate forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
