<p>Mimulus arenarius, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mimulus arenarius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
