<p>Microtatorchis wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's microtatorchis, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to orange, adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
