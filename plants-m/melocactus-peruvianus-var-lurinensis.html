<p>Melocactus peruvianus var. lurinensis, commonly known as the Lurinensis melocactus, is a distinctive cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and dense, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white, woolly bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. Its thick, ribbed structure helps it retain water in arid environments, and it is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
