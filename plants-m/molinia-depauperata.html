                    <h1>Molinia depauperata</h1>
<p>Molinia depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass or lesser moorgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs, heaths, and other wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Molinia depauperata is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
