                    <h1>Maieta neurotrica</h1>
<p>Maieta neurotrica, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Maieta neurotrica is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecosystem, though its parasitic nature can impact the health of its host trees.</p>
