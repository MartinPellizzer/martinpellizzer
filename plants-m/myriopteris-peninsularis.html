<p>Myriopteris peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular huperzia, is a rare fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in a rosette-like structure.</p>
<p>Myriopteris peninsularis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
