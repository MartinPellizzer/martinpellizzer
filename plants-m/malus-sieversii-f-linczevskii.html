<p>Malus sieversii f. linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii form of the Siberian crabapple, is a variant of the Siberian crabapple, native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its elliptical leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The fruit is typically small, sour, and edible, though it is not as widely cultivated as other crabapple varieties. This form is notable for its genetic contribution to modern apple cultivars due to its role in the domestication of the domestic apple.</p>
