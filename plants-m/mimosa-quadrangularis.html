                    <h1>Mimosa quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Mimosa quadrangularis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its quadrangular, hairy stems and bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense, globular clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its rapid leaf movement has made it a subject of scientific study in the field of plant physiology.</p>
