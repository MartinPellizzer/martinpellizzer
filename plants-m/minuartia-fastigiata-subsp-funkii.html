<p>Minuartia fastigiata subsp.</p>
<p>funkii, commonly known as the rock pillow, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes.</p>
