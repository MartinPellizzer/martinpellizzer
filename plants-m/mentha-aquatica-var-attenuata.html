                    <h1>Mentha aquatica var. attenuata</h1>
<p>Mentha aquatica var. attenuata, commonly known as water mint, is a variant of the water mint plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in wet soils near streams, ponds, and marshes, and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic leaves and adaptability to wet conditions, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
