                    <h1>Macleania farinosa</h1>
<p>Macleania farinosa, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which are often dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Macleania farinosa is characterized by its unique parasitic relationship with host trees, drawing nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
