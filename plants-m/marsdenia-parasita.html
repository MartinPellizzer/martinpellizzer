                    <h1>Marsdenia parasita</h1>
<p>Marsdenia parasita, commonly known as the parasitic milk vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host plants and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fleshy, orange-red berries.</p>
<p>Marsdenia parasita is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
