<p>Mentha pulegium var. micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and strongly aromatic, slightly peppery scent. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens due to its pest-repelling properties.</p>
