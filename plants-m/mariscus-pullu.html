<p>Mariscus pullu, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against drought.</p>
<p>Mariscus pullu is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
