                    <h1>Maerua arenaria</h1>
<p>Maerua arenaria, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Maerua arenaria plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
