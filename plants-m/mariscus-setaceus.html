<p>Mariscus setaceus, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20â€“40 centimeters and features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence.
