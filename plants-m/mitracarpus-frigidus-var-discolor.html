                    <h1>Mitracarpus frigidus var. discolor</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus frigidus var. discolor, commonly known as the frosty mitracarpus, is a rare and frost-sensitive plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its varietal name, discolor, refers to the distinctive color variation in its foliage, which can range from silver-green to bluish-gray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
