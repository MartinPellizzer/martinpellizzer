                    <h1>Metastelma atrorubens</h1>
<p>Metastelma atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for ornamental use in households.</p>
