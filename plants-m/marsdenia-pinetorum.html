                    <h1>Marsdenia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Marsdenia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest milkweed, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture.</p>
