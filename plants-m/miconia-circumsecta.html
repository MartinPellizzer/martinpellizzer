                    <h1>Miconia circumsecta</h1>
<p>Miconia circumsecta, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia circumsecta is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
