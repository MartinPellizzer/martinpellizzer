<p>Microchilus debilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. The plant features a delicate, grass-like foliage and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
