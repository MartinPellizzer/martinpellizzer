<p>Monotropa hypopitys subsp.</p>
<p>multiflora, commonly known as the ghost plant or Indian tobacco, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host trees for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and is often found in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the host tree.</p>
<p>This species is also noted for its unique ability to produce a mild narcotic effect when consumed.</p>
