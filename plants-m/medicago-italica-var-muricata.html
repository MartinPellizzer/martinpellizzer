                    <h1>Medicago italica var. muricata</h1>
<p>Medicago italica var. muricata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy stems.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy texture and robust growth habit contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance.</p>
