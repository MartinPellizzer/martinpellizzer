<p>Monella odora, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in yellow or greenish-white hues. The tree has a rough, fissured bark that exudes a strong, unpleasant odor when disturbed, which is the source of its common name. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a glossy surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>Monella odora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
