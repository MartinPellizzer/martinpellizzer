                    <h1>Myriaspora surinamensis</h1>
<p>Myriaspora surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam sponge coral, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the class Anthozoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, branching structure and is typically found in shallow tropical waters. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, which provide it with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its delicate, sponge-like appearance makes it a distinctive feature in coral reef ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not a true plant but a type of coral, and its botanical classification is often debated among marine biologists.</p>
