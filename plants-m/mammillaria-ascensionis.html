                    <h1>Mammillaria ascensionis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria ascensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island cactus, is a species native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
