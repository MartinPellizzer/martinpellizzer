                    <h1>Mariscus fulvus var. jucundus</h1>
<p>Mariscus fulvus var. jucundus, commonly known as the golden marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich wetlands, often near the edges of marshes or along the banks of slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
