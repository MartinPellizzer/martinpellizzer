<p>Muscaria basaitica, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a toxic species belonging to the Amanitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a white cap that turns yellow with age and a bulbous base that often has a volva. The mushroom contains potent toxins, including alpha-amatoxin, which can cause severe liver damage in humans. It is often mistaken for edible mushrooms, leading to accidental poisoning.</p>
<p>Its presence in forests and woodlands makes it a significant concern for foragers and mycologists alike.</p>
