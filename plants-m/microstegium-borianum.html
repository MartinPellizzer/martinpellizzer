                    <h1>Microstegium borianum</h1>
<p>Microstegium borianum, commonly known as the Borian's wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
