                    <h1>Mikania oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Mikania oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Mikania oblongifolia thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
