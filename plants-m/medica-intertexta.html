                    <h1>Medica intertexta</h1>
<p>Medica intertexta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Medica intertexta is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
