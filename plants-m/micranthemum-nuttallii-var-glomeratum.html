                    <h1>Micranthemum nuttallii var. glomeratum</h1>
<p>Micranthemum nuttallii var. glomeratum, commonly known as water wort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often submerged, though they may emerge at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
