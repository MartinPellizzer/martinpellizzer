                    <h1>Mammillaria rhodantha f. pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria rhodantha f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The plant features small, pale green to pinkish flowers that appear in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique pyramidal growth form, which distinguishes it from other members of the Mammillaria genus.</p>
