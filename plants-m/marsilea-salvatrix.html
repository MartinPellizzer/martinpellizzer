                    <h1>Marsilea salvatrix</h1>
<p>Marsilea salvatrix, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with small, heart-shaped leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
<p>Marsilea salvatrix is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
