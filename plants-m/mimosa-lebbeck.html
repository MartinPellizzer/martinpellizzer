                    <h1>Mimosa lebbeck</h1>
<p>Mimosa lebbeck, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts.</p>
