                    <h1>Mimosa pringlei var. pringlei</h1>
<p>Mimosa pringlei var. pringlei, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to physical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its woody stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
