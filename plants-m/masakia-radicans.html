                    <h1>Masakia radicans</h1>
<p>Masakia radicans, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a trailing or climbing growth habit with slender, hairy stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Masakia radicans is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its toxic sap requires caution during handling.</p>
