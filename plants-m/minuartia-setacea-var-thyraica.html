                    <h1>Minuartia setacea var. thyraica</h1>
<p>Minuartia setacea var. thyraica, commonly known as the stonecress or rock cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are usually white or pink, with four petals, and bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
