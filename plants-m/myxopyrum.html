<p>Myxopyrum, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, flattened structure and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Myxopyrum typically grows in dense mats, with a thalloid body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
