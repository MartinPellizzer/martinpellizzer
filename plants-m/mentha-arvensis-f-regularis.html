<p>Mentha arvensis f. regularis, commonly known as the common mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic essential oil from its leaves and stems, which is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species.</p>
