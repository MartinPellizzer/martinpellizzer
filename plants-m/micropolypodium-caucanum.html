                    <h1>Micropolypodium caucanum</h1>
<p>Micropolypodium caucanum, commonly known as the Cauca polypody, is a small epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, velvety texture, and its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. It is characterized by its compact size and ability to thrive in high-altitude, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Micropolypodium caucanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
