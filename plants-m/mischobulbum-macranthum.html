The plant's foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that grow from the base of the bulb. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
