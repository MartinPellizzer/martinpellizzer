                    <h1>Matucana formosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Matucana formosa var. minor, commonly known as the miniature matucana, is a compact, slow-growing bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
