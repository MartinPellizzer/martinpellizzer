                    <h1>Marattia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Marattia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobili, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Marattia microcarpa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
