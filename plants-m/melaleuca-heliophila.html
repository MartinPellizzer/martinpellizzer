<p>Melaleuca heliophila, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in coastal regions and sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands or heathlands. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Melaleuca heliophila is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
