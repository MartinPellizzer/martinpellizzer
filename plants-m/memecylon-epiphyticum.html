This plant is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Memecylon epiphyticum produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
