                    <h1>Melocactus ferox</h1>
<p>Melocactus ferox, commonly known as the fierce melon cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green skin and a single, prominent spineset at the top. The plant produces a large, yellow to orange fruit that is edible and resembles a melon, hence its common name. Melocactus ferox is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular ornamental plant among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
