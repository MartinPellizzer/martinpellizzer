                    <h1>Macrosiphonia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Macrosiphonia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety appearance due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called rhizoids. The plant forms large, floating mats that can be found in coastal areas with moderate to high salinity. Its reproductive structures, known as tetrasporophytes, are typically found on the underside of the thallus.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
