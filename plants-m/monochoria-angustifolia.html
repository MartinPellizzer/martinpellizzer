                    <h1>Monochoria angustifolia</h1>
<p>Monochoria angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water spinach, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in spikes, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and rice paddies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species.</p>
