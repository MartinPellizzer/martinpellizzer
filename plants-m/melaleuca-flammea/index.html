                            <h1>Melaleuca Flammea</h1>
<p>Red melaleuca, scientifically known as Melaleuca flammea, is a strikingly beautiful shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is renowned for its vibrant red flowers that bloom in dense, bottlebrush-like clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Its unique appearance and ecological importance have made it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and conservation efforts. Despite its beauty, the red melaleuca is also considered a potential invasive species in certain regions outside its native habitat.</p>
