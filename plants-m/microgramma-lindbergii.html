                    <h1>Microgramma lindbergii</h1>
<p>Microgramma lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, mat-like colonies, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, slightly curled appearance, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
