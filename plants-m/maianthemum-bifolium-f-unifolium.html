                    <h1>Maianthemum bifolium f. unifolium</h1>
<p>Maianthemum bifolium f. unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaved false lily of the valley, is a rare variant of the common maianthemum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen perennial with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, broad leaf that is often shorter than the stem. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical bifolium and is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its unique morphology.</p>
