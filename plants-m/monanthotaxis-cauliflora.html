<p>Monanthotaxis cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower tree, is a unique tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces large, fleshy, white or pinkish inflorescences that resemble cauliflower, hence its common name. Its leaves are large,革质 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Monanthotaxis cauliflora is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforests.</p>
