                    <h1>Mormodes uncia</h1>
<p>Mormodes uncia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
