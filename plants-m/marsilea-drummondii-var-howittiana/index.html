<p>Water clover, scientifically known as Marsilea drummondii var. howittiana, is a fascinating aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments. This species is characterized by its unique clover-like leaves, which give it its common name and make it easily identifiable. Native to regions such as Australia and New Zealand, it has adapted to a variety of water conditions including ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its delicate, floating leaves often create a carpet-like appearance on the water surface, adding both beauty and ecological value to its habitat. Water clover plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
