                    <h1>Maerua angolensis var. socotrana</h1>
<p>Maerua angolensis var. socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a spiny, shrub-like plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green and grey foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in the unique ecosystems of Socotra.</p>
