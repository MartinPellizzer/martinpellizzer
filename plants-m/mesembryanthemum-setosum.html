                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum setosum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum setosum, commonly known as the hairy ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum setosum is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
