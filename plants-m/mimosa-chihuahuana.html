                    <h1>Mimosa chihuahuana</h1>
<p>Mimosa chihuahuana, commonly known as the Chihuahua mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonasty. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa chihuahuana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
