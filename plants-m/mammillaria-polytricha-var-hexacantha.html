<p>Mammillaria polytricha var. hexacantha, commonly known as the six-armed hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its grayish-green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
