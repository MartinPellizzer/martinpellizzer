<p>Medicago tuberculata var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by the characteristic inflated, hairy seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and erosion control.</p>
