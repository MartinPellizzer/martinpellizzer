                    <h1>Medicago sativa f. glutinosa</h1>
<p>Medicago sativa f. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a variant of the common vetch that exhibits distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers are typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions.</p>
