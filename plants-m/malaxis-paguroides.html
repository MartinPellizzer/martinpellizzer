                    <h1>Malaxis paguroides</h1>
<p>Malaxis paguroides, commonly known as the Paguroid Ghost Orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a complex relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Malaxis paguroides is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
