                    <h1>Mesomelaena</h1>
<p>Mesomelaena, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has specialized roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates and filter out salt from the water. Its leaves are typically small,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesomelaena plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
