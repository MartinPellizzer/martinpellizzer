<p>Mespilus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it a notable early-flowering plant. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer, which are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mespilus hyemalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season.</p>
