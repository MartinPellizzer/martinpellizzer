                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata f. diplomera</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata f. diplomera, commonly known as the Diplomera cycad, is a rare and ornamental cycad species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, both typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
