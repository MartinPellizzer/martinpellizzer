                    <h1>Miconia cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Miconia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the humid forests of western Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas where it is introduced.</p>
