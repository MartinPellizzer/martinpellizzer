<p>Millettia ebenifera, commonly known as the African ebony tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has opposite, simple, and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
