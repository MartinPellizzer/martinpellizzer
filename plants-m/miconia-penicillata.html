<p>Miconia penicillata, commonly known as the pink miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
