                    <h1>Mimosa prorepens</h1>
<p>Mimosa prorepens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Mimosa prorepens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and delicate appearance.</p>
