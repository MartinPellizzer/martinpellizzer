<p>Melocactus parvispinus, commonly known as the small-spined melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in sparse, pale spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by orange or red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections.</p>
