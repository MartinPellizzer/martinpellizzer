<p>Mammillaria schiedeana subsp.</p>
<p>dumetorum, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in small, white tubercles that give it a spiny, textured appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
