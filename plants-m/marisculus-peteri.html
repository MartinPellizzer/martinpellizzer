<p>Marisculus peteri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Marisculus peteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
