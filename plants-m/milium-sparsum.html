                    <h1>Milium sparsum</h1>
<p>Milium sparsum, commonly known as the scattered millet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in harsh environments. Milium sparsum typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its resilience and adaptability make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
