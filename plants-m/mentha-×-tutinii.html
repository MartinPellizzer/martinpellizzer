                    <h1>Mentha × tutinii</h1>
<p>Mentha × tutinii, commonly known as hybrid mint, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Mentha spicata (spearmint).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a strong menthol scent, which is a combination of the characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with square stems and opposite, serrated leaves. It is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, pharmaceuticals, and flavoring industries.</p>
<p>However, due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for propagation.</p>
