                    <h1>Mikania troyana</h1>
<p>Mikania troyana, commonly known as the troyan mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in fluffy, white pappus that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to smother other vegetation, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas.</p>
