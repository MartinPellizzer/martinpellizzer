                    <h1>Microsorum</h1>
<p>Microsorum, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often float on the water's surface or grow along the edges of water bodies. Microsorum species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
<p>Their rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and prevent erosion.</p>
