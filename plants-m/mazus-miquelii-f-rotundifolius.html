                    <h1>Mazus miquelii f. rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Mazus miquelii f. rotundifolius, commonly known as the rounded-leaf mazus, is a rare and unique variant of the Mazus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broadly ovate, rounded leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical species. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
