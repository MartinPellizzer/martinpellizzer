<p>Maxillaria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, arranged in a fan shape around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Maxillaria glomerata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
