<p>Microtrichomanes powellii, commonly known as Powell's spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjania, which is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures. The plant has delicate, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, spathulate leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
