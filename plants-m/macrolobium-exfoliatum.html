<p>Macrolobium exfoliatum, commonly known as the peeling-leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that often peel away in layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and rough, providing a natural defense against pests and environmental stress.</p>
<p>The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
