<p>Micropyxis exigua, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal.</p>
<p>Micropyxis exigua plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
