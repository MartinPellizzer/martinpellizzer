<p>Microtatorchis musciformis, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that resembles moss, though it is more closely related to liverworts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including gemmae, are often found on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Microtatorchis musciformis plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
