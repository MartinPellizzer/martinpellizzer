<p>Mimosa bifurca var. hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's sensitive plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its unique leaf movement.</p>
