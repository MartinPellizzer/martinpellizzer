                    <h1>Microtrema</h1>
<p>Microtrema, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus, which is a leaf-like structure that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Microtrema reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
