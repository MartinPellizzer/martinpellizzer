<p>Myriopteris wrightii, commonly known as Wright's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
