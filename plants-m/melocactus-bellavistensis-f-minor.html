<p>Melocactus bellavistensis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature bell melon cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the dry forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, rounded stem that is typically greenish-yellow in color, often with a faint bluish tint. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
