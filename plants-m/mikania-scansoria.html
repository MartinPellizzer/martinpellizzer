<p>Mikania scansoria, commonly known as the creeping morningglory, is a vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread quickly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Mikania scansoria is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
