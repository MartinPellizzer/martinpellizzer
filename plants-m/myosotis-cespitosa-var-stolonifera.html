                    <h1>Myosotis cespitosa var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Myosotis cespitosa var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping forget-me-not, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, damp environments.</p>
