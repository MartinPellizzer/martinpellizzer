                    <h1>Macrozamia heteromera var. dicranophylloides</h1>
<p>Macrozamia heteromera var. dicranophylloides, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
