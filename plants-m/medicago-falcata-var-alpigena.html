                    <h1>Medicago falcata var. alpigena</h1>
<p>Medicago falcata var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, sickle-shaped leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>The varietal form alpigena is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical variety.</p>
