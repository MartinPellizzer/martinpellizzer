                    <h1>Mammillaria robusta</h1>
<p>Mammillaria robusta, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its desert habitat. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
<p>Mammillaria robusta thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates.</p>
