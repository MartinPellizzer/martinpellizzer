                    <h1>Mallotus illudens</h1>
<p>Mallotus illudens, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soil. It produces small, reddish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
