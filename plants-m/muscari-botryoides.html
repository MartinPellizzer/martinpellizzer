<p>Muscari botryoides, commonly known as the grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, resembling tiny grapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring, and it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
<p>Muscari botryoides is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread over time, creating vibrant displays in gardens.</p>
