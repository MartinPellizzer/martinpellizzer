<p>Maekawaea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited maekawaea, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streamside areas and rocky habitats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
