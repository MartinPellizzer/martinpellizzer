                            <h1>Malva Alcea Subsp. Fastigiata</h1>
<p>Malva alcea subsp. fastigiata is a lesser-known member of the Malvaceae family, distinguished by its upright growth and striking pink flowers. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its unique, fastigiate form gives it a sculptural appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. While not as widely cultivated as its relatives, it holds ecological value by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small insects. This subspecies offers both aesthetic appeal and botanical interest, warranting greater recognition in horticultural practices.</p>
