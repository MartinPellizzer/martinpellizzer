<p>Mapuchea paniculata, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
