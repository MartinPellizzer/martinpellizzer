<p>Melica ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate (fringed) margins, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat diversity.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
