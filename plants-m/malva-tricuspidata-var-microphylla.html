                    <h1>Malva tricuspidata var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Malva tricuspidata var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Malva tricuspidata, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves make it useful in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum.</p>
