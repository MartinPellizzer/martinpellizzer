<p>Myriophyllum verticillatum subsp.</p>
<p>intermedium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater lakes and slow-moving rivers, often forming dense mats that can impact water quality and aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
