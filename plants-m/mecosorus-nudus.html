                    <h1>Mecosorus nudus</h1>
<p>Mecosorus nudus, commonly known as the naked orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mecosorus nudus is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
