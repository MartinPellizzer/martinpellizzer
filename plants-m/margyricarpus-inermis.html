                    <h1>Margyricarpus inermis</h1>
<p>Margyricarpus inermis, commonly known as the smooth-fruit margyricarpus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant produces smooth, oval fruits that are distinct from those of its relatives. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
