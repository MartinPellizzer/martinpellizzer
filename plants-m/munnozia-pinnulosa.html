<p>Munnozia pinnulosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Munnozia pinnulosa is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
