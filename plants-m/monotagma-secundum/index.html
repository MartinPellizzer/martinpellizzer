                            <h1>Monotagma Secundum</h1>
<p>Blue-eyed mary, scientifically known as Monotagma secundum, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. Its name comes from the vivid blue petals that resemble large, expressive eyes, giving it a whimsical and enchanting appearance. This perennial species is celebrated for its resilience and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice among gardeners. With its delicate yet bold blooms, it adds a touch of elegance to alpine gardens and rockeries. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively obscure plant in the broader horticultural world.</p>
