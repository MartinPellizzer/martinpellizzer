<p>Minuartia recurva subsp.</p>
<p>juressi, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments where it tolerates harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
