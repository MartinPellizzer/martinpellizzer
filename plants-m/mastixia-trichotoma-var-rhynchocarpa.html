                    <h1>Mastixia trichotoma var. rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Mastixia trichotoma var. rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mastixia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions, showing some resistance to salt spray.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its potential for use in horticulture.</p>
