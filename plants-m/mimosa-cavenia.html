                    <h1>Mimosa cavenia</h1>
<p>Mimosa cavenia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique movement, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
