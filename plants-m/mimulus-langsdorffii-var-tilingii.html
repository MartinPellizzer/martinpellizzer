                    <h1>Mimulus langsdorffii var. tilingii</h1>
<p>Mimulus langsdorffii var. tilingii, commonly known as the Tiling's monkeyflower, is a species native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its striking orange to red tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species for studying adaptive evolution in Mediterranean climates.</p>
