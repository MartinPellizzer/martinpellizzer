                    <h1>Myristica archboldiana</h1>
<p>Myristica archboldiana, commonly known as the Archbold's nutmeg, is a rare and endangered species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, tropical tree morphology. The plant produces aromatic seeds that are closely related to nutmeg and mace, though it is not commercially harvested. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits unique adaptations to its specific ecological niche in the rainforest understory.</p>
