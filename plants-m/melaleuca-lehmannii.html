                    <h1>Melaleuca lehmannii</h1>
<p>Melaleuca lehmannii, commonly known as the Lemon Myrtle, is a shrub native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is fibrous and often peels in thin layers, revealing a pale inner surface.</p>
<p>Melaleuca lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine.</p>
