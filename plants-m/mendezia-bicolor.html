<p>Mendezia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of live oaks and other hardwood trees, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are dark blue to black in color, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its unique two-colored foliage, with upper leaves being lighter than the lower ones.</p>
