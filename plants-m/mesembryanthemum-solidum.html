                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum solidum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum solidum, commonly known as the rock rose or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum solidum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
