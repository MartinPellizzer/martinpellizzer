                    <h1>Malus ringo sublobata</h1>
<p>Malus ringo sublobata, commonly known as the sublobed apple, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malus genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that have a distinctive sublobed margin, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible fruits similar to apples.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species.</p>
