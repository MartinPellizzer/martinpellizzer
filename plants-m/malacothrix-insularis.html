                    <h1>Malacothrix insularis</h1>
<p>Malacothrix insularis, commonly known as the island hair-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its small, trifoliate leaves and ability to fix nitrogen make it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
