                    <h1>Muhlenbergia brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Muhlenbergia brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver-green flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Muhlenbergia brachyphylla is also noted for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens that feature native or drought-resistant plants.</p>
