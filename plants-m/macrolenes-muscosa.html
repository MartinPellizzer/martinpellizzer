                    <h1>Macrolenes muscosa</h1>
<p>Macrolenes muscosa, commonly known as the mossy macrolichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that often appears in shades of green, yellow, or brown, depending on environmental conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Macrolenes muscosa is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
