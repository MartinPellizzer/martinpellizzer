<p>Micromeria cristata subsp.</p>
<p>xylorrhiza, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
