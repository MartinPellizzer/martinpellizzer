<p>Melocactus azureus subsp.</p>
<p>ferreophilus, commonly known as the blue melocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically blue-green in color due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
