<p>Myriophyllum spicatum subsp.</p>
<p>exalbescens, commonly known as the white watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically pale green to white in color, distinguishing it from other watermilfoil species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often visible above the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers, where it can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can play a role in both aquatic ecosystems and aquatic weed management.</p>
