                    <h1>Microtidium atratum</h1>
<p>Microtidium atratum, commonly known as the black-leafed microtidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique foliage and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Microtidium atratum is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
