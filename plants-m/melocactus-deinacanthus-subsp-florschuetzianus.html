<p>Melocactus deinacanthus subsp.</p>
<p>florschuetzianus, commonly known as the Sch√ºtz's melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that is often ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
