<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
