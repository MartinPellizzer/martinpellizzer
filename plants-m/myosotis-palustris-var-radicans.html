                    <h1>Myosotis palustris var. radicans</h1>
<p>Myosotis palustris var. radicans, commonly known as the trailing water violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
