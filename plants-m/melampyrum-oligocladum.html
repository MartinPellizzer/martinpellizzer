<p>Melampyrum oligocladum, commonly known as the lesser touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate and often have a glandular surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
