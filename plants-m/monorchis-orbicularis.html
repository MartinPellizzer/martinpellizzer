<p>Monorchis orbicularis, commonly known as the round liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped thallus that is often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized areas called gemma cups.</p>
<p>Monorchis orbicularis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
