<p>Marsilea rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthan water clover, is a rare aquatic fern found in the wetlands of Rajasthan, India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, with each leaflet being deeply lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporocarps, are typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
