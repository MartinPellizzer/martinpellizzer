                    <h1>Melaleuca cinerea</h1>
<p>Melaleuca cinerea, commonly known as the silver melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Myrtaceae family. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Melaleuca cinerea is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is commonly used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
