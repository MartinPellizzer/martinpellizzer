<p>Melaleuca sabrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by insects and birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Melaleuca sabrina is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
