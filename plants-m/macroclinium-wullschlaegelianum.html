<p>Macroclinium wullschlaegelianum, commonly known as the Wullschlaegel's macroclinium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the rich, organic soil of the canopy floor.</p>
