                    <h1>Marsilea crenata</h1>
<p>Marsilea crenata, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance, with small, floating leaves that often form a rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporocarps that develop on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea crenata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae growth.</p>
