<p>Melocactus violaceus subsp.</p>
<p>ritteri, commonly known as the violet melocactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, especially under direct sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its deep-colored body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
