                <h1>Mariscus pedunculatus</h1>
<p>Mariscus pedunculatus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Mariscus pedunculatus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition.</p>
