<p>Mappa motleyana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Mappa motleyana thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
