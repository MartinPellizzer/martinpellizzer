                    <h1>Mangle</h1>
<p>Mangle, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a salt-tolerant evergreen tree that thrives in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Mangroves play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>They are also important in filtering pollutants from water.</p>
