                    <h1>Montia arvensis</h1>
<p>Montia arvensis, commonly known as field stitchwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils, often found in fields, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small white or pink flowers in clusters. Its flowers are actinomorphic and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Montia arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
