<p>Mimosa argentinensis, commonly known as the Argentine mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitive leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, globular seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa argentinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
