                    <h1>Manniella cypripedioides</h1>
<p>Manniella cypripedioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking white, spider-like flowers that bloom directly from the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
