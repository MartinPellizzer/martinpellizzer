                    <h1>Miconia borealis</h1>
<p>Miconia borealis, commonly known as the northern miconia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests. The plant features large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and numerous stamens, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Miconia borealis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
