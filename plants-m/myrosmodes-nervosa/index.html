                            <h1>Myrosmodes Nervosa</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Myrosmodes nervosa, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is renowned for its vibrant, flame-like inflorescences that display a range of colors from red to orange and yellow. This tree thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice among horticulturists and landscape designers. Despite its beauty, the coral tree requires well-drained soil and protection from frost to flourish.</p>
