                    <h1>Micropus exiguus</h1>
<p>Micropus exiguus, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Micropus exiguus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native environment.</p>
