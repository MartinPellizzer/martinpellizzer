                    <h1>Misodendrum oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Misodendrum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, elongated, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to parts of South America and is adapted to thrive in shaded, forested environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants over time if left unchecked.</p>
