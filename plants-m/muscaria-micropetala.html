                    <h1>Muscaria micropetala</h1>
<p>Muscaria micropetala, commonly known as the small-petaled fly agaric, is a species of psychedelic mushroom native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to ochre-colored cap, which is often covered with a fine, powdery coating. The stem is short and bulbous, with a distinct ring near the base. Its gills are pale yellow and closely spaced, and it produces spores in a distinctive, sticky layer.</p>
<p>This species is closely related to the more famous Amanita muscaria but is less commonly encountered in the wild.</p>
