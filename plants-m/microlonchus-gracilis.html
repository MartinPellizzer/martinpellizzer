                    <h1>Microlonchus gracilis</h1>
<p>Microlonchus gracilis, commonly known as the slender burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds covered in a rough, bristly coating. Its adaptations to dry environments include deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Microlonchus gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
