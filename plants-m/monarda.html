                    <h1>Monarda</h1>
<p>Monarda, commonly known as bergamot, is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to eastern North America and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically aromatic and often used in herbal teas, though they are not related to the citrus fruit bergamot. Monarda species are often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
