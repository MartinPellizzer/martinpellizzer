<p>Macrozamia miquelii, commonly known as the Miquel's cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
