<p>Maxillaria roseola, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, green, round pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Maxillaria roseola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates.</p>
