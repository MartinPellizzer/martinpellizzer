                    <h1>Miconia formicoheterophylla</h1>
<p>Miconia formicoheterophylla, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which varies depending on the presence of ant colonies. The plant forms specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores by deterring them.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Miconia formicoheterophylla highlight a fascinating mutualistic relationship between the plant and its ant inhabitants.</p>
