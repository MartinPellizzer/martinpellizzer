                    <h1>Macrozamia reducta</h1>
<p>Macrozamia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
