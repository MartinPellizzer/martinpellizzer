                    <h1>Mimosa carinata</h1>
<p>Mimosa carinata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid leaf closure makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations.</p>
