                    <h1>Mimosa plumosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa plumosa, commonly known as the silky mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that give it a soft, cloud-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
