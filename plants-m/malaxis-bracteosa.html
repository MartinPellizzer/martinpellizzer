                    <h1>Malaxis bracteosa</h1>
<p>Malaxis bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Like many orchids, it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
