                    <h1>Miconia sterilis</h1>
<p>Miconia sterilis, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Miconia sterilis make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
