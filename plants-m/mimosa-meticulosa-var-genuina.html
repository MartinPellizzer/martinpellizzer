<p>Mimosa meticulosa var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow-pink flowers that bloom in spring.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets also make it an effective soil stabilizer in disturbed areas.</p>
