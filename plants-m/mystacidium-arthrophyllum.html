<p>Mystacidium arthrophyllum, commonly known as the flax lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, greenish-gray thallus with distinct lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution, it serves as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
