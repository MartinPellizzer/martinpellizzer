                    <h1>Marrubium × wilkommii</h1>
<p>Marrubium × wilkommii, commonly known as the hybrid horehound, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Marrubium vulgare (common horehound) and Marrubium officinale (woolly horehound), resulting in a plant with distinctive gray-green foliage. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a woolly texture, and the plant produces small blue or purple flowers in the summer. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its high content of marrubiin.</p>
<p>This hybrid is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and respiratory benefits.</p>
