                    <h1>Melocactus onychacanthus var. albescens</h1>
<p>Melocactus onychacanthus var. albescens, commonly known as the white-spined melocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to a small region in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem covered in white, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
