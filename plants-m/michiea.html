                    <h1>Michiea</h1>
<p>Michiea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Michiea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They produce small, inconspicuous fruits that are often dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species, making it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
