<p>Mucuna diabolica subsp.</p>
<p>diabolica, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiny pods that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>The plant produces a significant amount of nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, and it blooms throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is often avoided in agricultural settings.</p>
