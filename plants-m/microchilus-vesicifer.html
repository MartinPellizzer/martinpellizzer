                    <h1>Microchilus vesicifer</h1>
<p>Microchilus vesicifer, commonly known as the bladderleaf fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces spore capsules that are inflated, giving it its common name, and these capsules are typically borne on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
