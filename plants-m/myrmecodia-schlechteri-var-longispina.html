                    <h1>Myrmecodia schlechteri var. longispina</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia schlechteri var. longispina, commonly known as the horned antplant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like caudex and specialized structures called "pseudopods" that house colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
