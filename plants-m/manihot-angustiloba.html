<p>Manihot angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassava, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a milky sap that is toxic if ingested. Its roots are used in some traditional contexts, though they are not as economically important as other cassava varieties.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
