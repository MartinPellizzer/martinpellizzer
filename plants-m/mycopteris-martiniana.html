<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance, which gives the plant its common name.

<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
