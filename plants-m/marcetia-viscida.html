                    <h1>Marcetia viscida</h1>
<p>Marcetia viscida, commonly known as the sticky marsh plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in trapping insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting insect populations and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
