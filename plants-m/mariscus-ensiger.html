                    <h1>Mariscus ensiger</h1>
<p>Mariscus ensiger, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Mariscus ensiger is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
