<p>Monstera deliciosa, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that develop distinctive holes as they mature. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and anchor itself to supports as it grows.</p>
<p>Monstera deliciosa is popular as a houseplant due to its striking foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
