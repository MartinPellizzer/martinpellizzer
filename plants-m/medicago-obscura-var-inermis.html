                    <h1>Medicago obscura var. inermis</h1>
<p>Medicago obscura var. inermis, commonly known as the slender goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration.</p>
