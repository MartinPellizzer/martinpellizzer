                    <h1>Mercurialis reverchonii var. riatarum</h1>
<p>Mercurialis reverchonii var. riatarum, commonly known as the coastal mercury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations.</p>
