<p>Maerua urophylla, commonly known as the white maerua, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle aesthetic to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its woody stem is often branched and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Maerua urophylla is well adapted to drought conditions, showcasing resilience and survival strategies typical of desert flora.</p>
