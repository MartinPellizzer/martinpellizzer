                    <h1>Myrmecodia prolifera</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia prolifera, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its ant inhabitants, which in turn protect it from herbivores and help with nutrient cycling. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are often pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia prolifera is native to Southeast Asia and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
