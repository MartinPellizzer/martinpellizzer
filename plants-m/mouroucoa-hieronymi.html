                    <h1>Mouroucoa hieronymi</h1>
<p>Mouroucoa hieronymi, commonly known as the São Tomé star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of São Tomé.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vibrant yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the montane forests of the island. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Mouroucoa hieronymi is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
