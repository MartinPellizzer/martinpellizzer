<p>Myrmecodia schlechteri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thorn-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological role.</p>
