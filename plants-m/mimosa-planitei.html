<p>Mimosa planitei, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational settings.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
