<p>Microtatorchis compacta, commonly known as the compact dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant blooms with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids.</p>
