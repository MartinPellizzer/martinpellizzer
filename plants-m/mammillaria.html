<p>Mammillaria, commonly known as the pincushion cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the deserts of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their globular or cylindrical stems, which are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The stems are typically spineless or have short, fine spines, and they store water in their thick, fleshy tissues. Mammillaria species produce flowers in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, red, and pink, often during the spring or summer.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture due to their compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
