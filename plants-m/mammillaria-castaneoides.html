<p>Mammillaria castaneoides, commonly known as the chestnut milk barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a gray-green body covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
