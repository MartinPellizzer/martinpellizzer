                    <h1>Marsilea hirsuta</h1>
<p>Marsilea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, with four to six lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea hirsuta is often used in ornamental ponds and is also studied for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
