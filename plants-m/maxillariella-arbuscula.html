                    <h1>Maxillariella arbuscula</h1>
<p>Maxillariella arbuscula, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the humid tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections.</p>
