<p>Mariscus rufus, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically red or reddish in color, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is native to dry, rocky habitats in regions such as North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Mariscus rufus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
