<p>[WRONG START] Macleidium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny macleid, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Macledium spinosum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
