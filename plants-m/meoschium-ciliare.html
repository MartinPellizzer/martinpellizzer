                    <h1>Meoschium ciliare</h1>
<p>Meoschium ciliare, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy margins, which give it its common name. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Meoschium ciliare plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
