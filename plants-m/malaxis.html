                    <h1>Malaxis</h1>
<p>Malaxis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often pendulous stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Malaxis species typically grow on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Their flowers are usually white or pale in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and habitat specificity, many Malaxis species are considered endangered.</p>
