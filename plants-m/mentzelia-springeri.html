                    <h1>Mentzelia springeri</h1>
<p>Mentzelia springeri, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mentzelia springeri plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
