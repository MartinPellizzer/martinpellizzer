                    <h1>Mimosa fruticosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa fruticosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or silky mimosas, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for erosion control and soil improvement.</p>
