<p>Mentha longifolia subsp.</p>
<p>minutiflora, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a strong, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol-like fragrance and cooling properties.</p>
