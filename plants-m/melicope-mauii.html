<p>Melicope mauii, commonly known as Maui's melicope, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mesic forests, often near streams or on rocky slopes. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several small, elliptical seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Melicope mauii is critically endangered and is a priority for conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
