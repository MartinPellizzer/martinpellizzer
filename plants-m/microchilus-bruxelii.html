                    <h1>Microchilus bruxelii</h1>
<p>Microchilus bruxelii, commonly known as the Brussels moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort native to Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct thalloid structure with a green, leafy surface covered in tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized leaf-like structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
