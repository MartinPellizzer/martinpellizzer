<p>Macrobalanus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It includes species that are typically found in coastal and estuarine environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The plants are characterized by their ability to thrive in saline and brackish water conditions, which is a key adaptation for their habitat. Their leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often producing edible fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
