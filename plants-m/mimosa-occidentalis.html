                    <h1>Mimosa occidentalis</h1>
<p>Mimosa occidentalis, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Mimosa occidentalis is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
