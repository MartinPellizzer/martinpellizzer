                    <h1>Miconia cruenta</h1>
<p>Miconia cruenta, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually green with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for local ecosystems.</p>
