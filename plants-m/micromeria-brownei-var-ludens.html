                    <h1>Micromeria brownei var. ludens</h1>
<p>Micromeria brownei var. ludens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its floral structure is typical of the Geraniaceae family, featuring five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
