                    <h1>Magnistipula sapinii</h1>
<p>Magnistipula sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine silverbark, is a rare and hardy shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by tiny, elliptical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Magnistipula sapinii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
