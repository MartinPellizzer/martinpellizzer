<p>Menyanthes hydrophyllum, commonly known as water mint, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Menyanthes hydrophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
