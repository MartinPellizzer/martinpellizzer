                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum martleyi</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum martleyi, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or ozark star, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a response to light and temperature changes. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum martleyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
