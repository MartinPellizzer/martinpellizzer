                    <h1>Megacorax gracielanus</h1>
<p>Megacorax gracielanus, commonly known as the graceful giant fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid rainforests of Central and South America. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitats.</p>
