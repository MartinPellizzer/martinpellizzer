<p>Moniera monnieri, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Moniera monnieri plays an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
