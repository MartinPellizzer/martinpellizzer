                    <h1>Megalastrum wacketii</h1>
<p>Megalastrum wacketii, commonly known as the Wacket's megalastrum, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture, adapting to its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, Megalastrum wacketii remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
