                    <h1>Melaleuca globifera</h1>
<p>Melaleuca globifera, commonly known as the globeflower melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of northern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in the arid conditions it inhabits.</p>
<p>Melaleuca globifera is also known for its aromatic oils, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance.</p>
