<p>Mammillaria miegiana, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a spiny, segmented stem covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Mammillaria miegiana is prized for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
