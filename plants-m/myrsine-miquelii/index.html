<p>Miquel's myrsine, scientifically known as Myrsine miquelii, is a lesser-known yet fascinating plant species native to the Philippines. This evergreen shrub belongs to the family Myrsinaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in lowland forests and mountainous regions. Despite its limited distribution, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
