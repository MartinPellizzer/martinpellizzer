                    <h1>Malephora</h1>
<p>Malephora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in low light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint, sweet scent, attracting specific pollinators at night. Its roots are known to secrete a unique compound that helps it absorb moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Malephora is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
