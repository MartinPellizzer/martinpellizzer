                    <h1>Mastichodendron microphyllum</h1>
<p>Mastichodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved mastichodendron, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
