<p>Matteuccia struthiopteris subsp.</p>
<p>sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous shield fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lobed segments.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile leaves appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
