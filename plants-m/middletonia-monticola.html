<p>Middletonia monticola, commonly known as the mountain middletonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in flat-topped umbels, and bloom during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Middletonia monticola is considered a conservation concern.</p>
