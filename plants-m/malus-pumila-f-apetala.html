                    <h1>Malus pumila f. apetala</h1>
<p>Malus pumila f. apetala, commonly known as the apple tree with no petals, is a unique variant of the apple tree characterized by its lack of petal formation.</p>
<p>This botanical feature distinguishes it from typical apple varieties, which usually have showy petals. The plant retains the other typical characteristics of the Malus genus, including its fruiting habit and leaf structure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value or as a genetic resource for breeding programs.</p>
<p>Its floral morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical studies and horticultural research.</p>
