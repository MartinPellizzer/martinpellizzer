                    <h1>Mimosa staminea</h1>
<p>Mimosa staminea, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically woody and covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Mimosa staminea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
