                    <h1>Melica sarmentosa var. glabrior</h1>
<p>Melica sarmentosa var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth匍匐grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in moist, often disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties within the species.</p>
