                    <h1>Mentha zomborensis</h1>
<p>Mentha zomborensis, commonly known as the Zombie Mint, is a rare and enigmatic species of mint native to the misty highlands of Zombora.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dark, almost black leaves and a pungent, slightly metallic scent that is said to repel insects and attract certain nocturnal pollinators. Its flowering stems produce small, pale blue flowers that bloom only under moonlight, adding to its mysterious allure. The plant is believed to have medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its elusive nature and the difficulty of cultivating it outside its native habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its ominous common name, Mentha zomborensis remains a subject of fascination for botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
