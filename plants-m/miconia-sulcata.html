                    <h1>Miconia sulcata</h1>
<p>Miconia sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Miconia sulcata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
