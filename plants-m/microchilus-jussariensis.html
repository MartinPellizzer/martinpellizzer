<p>Microchilus jussariensis, commonly known as the Jussariense fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or forested substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, known as sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
