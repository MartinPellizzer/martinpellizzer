                    <h1>Mentha pulegium f. strongylophylla</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium f. strongylophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a strong, distinctive minty aroma due to the presence of pulegone, a volatile compound.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care.</p>
