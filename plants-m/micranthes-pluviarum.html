                    <h1>Micranthes pluviarum</h1>
<p>Micranthes pluviarum, commonly known as the rainplant, is a small herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its reproductive strategy relies on wind pollination, which is facilitated by its inconspicuous floral structure.</p>
<p>Micranthes pluviarum is often found in rich, organic soils along stream banks and in wet woodlands.</p>
