                    <h1>Miconia polyneura</h1>
<p>Miconia polyneura, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Miconia polyneura is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
