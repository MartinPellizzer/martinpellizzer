                    <h1>Maranta closonii</h1>
<p>Maranta closonii, commonly known as the "Prayer Plant," is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that change color with the time of day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves fold upwards at night and unfold in the morning, a unique adaptation to conserve moisture and protect against predators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
