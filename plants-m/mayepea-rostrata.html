                    <h1>Mayepea rostrata</h1>
<p>Mayepea rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated mayepea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive rostrated (beak-like) calyx that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mayepea rostrata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
