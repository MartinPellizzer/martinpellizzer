                    <h1>Mespilus monogyna f. horrida</h1>
<p>Mespilus monogyna f. horrida, commonly known as the bristly medlar, is a horticultural form of the medlar tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture on the fruit and stems, which distinguishes it from the typical medlar. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, pome-like fruits in the autumn. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit characteristics.</p>
