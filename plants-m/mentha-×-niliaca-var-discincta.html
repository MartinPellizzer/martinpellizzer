<p>Mentha × niliaca var. discincta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hybrid mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha longifolia and Mentha spicata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of its relatives, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain menthol and other compounds, giving it a strong, minty fragrance and making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
