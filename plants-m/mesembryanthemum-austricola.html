                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum austricola</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum austricola, commonly known as the Australian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in dry conditions makes it an excellent example of a drought-resistant succulent.</p>
