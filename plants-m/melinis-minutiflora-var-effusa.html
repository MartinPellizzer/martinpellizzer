                    <h1>Melinis minutiflora var. effusa</h1>
<p>Melinis minutiflora var. effusa, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form a thick mat, making it an effective ground cover. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
