                    <h1>Mikania elliptica</h1>
<p>Mikania elliptica, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>The fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
