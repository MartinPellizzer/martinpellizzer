                    <h1>Madronella viridis</h1>
<p>Madronella viridis, commonly known as the green madrona, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and berries are used in traditional Native American medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
