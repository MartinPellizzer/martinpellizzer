                    <h1>Microbahia</h1>
<p>Microbahia, commonly known as the "bushy groundcover," is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked but essential for its reproductive cycle. Microbahia thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover for erosion control and habitat for small organisms.</p>
