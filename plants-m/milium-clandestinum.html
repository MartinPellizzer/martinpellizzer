                    <h1>Milium clandestinum</h1>
<p>Milium clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden millet, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, producing tiny grains that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native habitat.</p>
