<p>Medicago nummularia, commonly known as narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in grasslands, road sides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Medicago nummularia is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings.</p>
