<p>Microlepia manohara, commonly known as the Manohara water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in the spread of the plant within its habitat.</p>
<p>Microlepia manohara plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
