<p>Mammillaria bachmannii, commonly known as the Bachmann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in white, woolly spines that help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>Mammillaria bachmannii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
