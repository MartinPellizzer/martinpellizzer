<p>Malaxis mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, slender spikes of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature common in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
