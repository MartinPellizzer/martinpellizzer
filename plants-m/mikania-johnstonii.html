                    <h1>Mikania johnstonii</h1>
<p>Mikania johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's mile-a-minute weed, is a fast-growing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is known for its aggressive growth habit, often spreading rapidly through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas where it has been introduced.</p>
