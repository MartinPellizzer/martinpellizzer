                    <h1>Mimosa lacustris</h1>
<p>Mimosa lacustris, commonly known as the water mimosa, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as lakes and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful pioneer species and a potential invasive plant in certain regions.</p>
