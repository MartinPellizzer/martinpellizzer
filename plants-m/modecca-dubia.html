                    <h1>Modecca dubia</h1>
<p>Modecca dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of hardwood trees. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Modecca dubia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
