                    <h1>Mimosa manzanilloana</h1>
<p>Mimosa manzanilloana, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold shutâ€”a response known as thigmonastic movement. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Mimosa manzanilloana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
