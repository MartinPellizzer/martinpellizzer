<p>Muscaria rhodanica, commonly known as the red-staining fly agaric, is a species of hallucinogenic mushroom belonging to the genus *Amanita*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by a bright red cap with white warts and a distinctive volva at the base of its stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in woodland areas, especially in temperate regions during late summer and early autumn. The mushroom contains psychoactive compounds such as muscimol and ibotenic acid, which affect the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not safe for consumption and is often avoided in foraging activities.</p>
