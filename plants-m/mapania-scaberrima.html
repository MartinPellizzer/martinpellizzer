                    <h1>Mapania scaberrima</h1>
<p>Mapania scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, dark green leaves that are often covered in small, raised dots. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
