                    <h1>Macrosiphonia petraea</h1>
<p>Macrosiphonia petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is composed of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterium and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant exhibits a dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, leathery texture. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
