                    <h1>Mystacinus mystacinus</h1>
<p>Mystacinus mystacinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It has long, slender roots that anchor it to tree bark and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
