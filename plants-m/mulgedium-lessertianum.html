                    <h1>Mulgedium lessertianum</h1>
<p>Mulgedium lessertianum, commonly known as the silverleaf mulgedium, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its lance-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
