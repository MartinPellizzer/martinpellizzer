<p>cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed megalochlamys, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and conical, spiky capitula that bear yellow to orange composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions to avoid root rot.</p>
