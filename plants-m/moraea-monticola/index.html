<p>Moraea monticola is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. This plant is known for its vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species.
