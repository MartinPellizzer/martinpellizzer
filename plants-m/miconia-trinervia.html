                    <h1>Miconia trinervia</h1>
<p>Miconia trinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Miconia trinervia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
