<p>Mammillaria nana subsp.</p>
<p>duwei, commonly known as the dwarf hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
