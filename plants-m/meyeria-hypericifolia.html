                    <h1>Meyeria hypericifolia</h1>
<p>Meyeria hypericifolia, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense ground covers in suitable conditions.</p>
