                    <h1>Microsisymbrium lasiophyllum var. inalienum</h1>
<p>Microsisymbrium lasiophyllum var. inalienum, commonly known as the Inalienable Bristlepod, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with dense, bristly foliage and small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are typically hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
