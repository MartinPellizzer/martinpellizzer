                            <h1>Mahonia Nevinii</h1>
<p>Mahonia nevinii is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is known for its striking blue-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires special conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
