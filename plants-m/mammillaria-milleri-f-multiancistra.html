<p>Mammillaria milleri f. multiancistra, commonly known as the multibract mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rounded stem covered in white, woolly spines and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its multiple bracts, which give it its specific epithet. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appearance.</p>
