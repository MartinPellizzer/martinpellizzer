                    <h1>Mammillaria radiosa f. arizonica</h1>
<p>Mammillaria radiosa f. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
