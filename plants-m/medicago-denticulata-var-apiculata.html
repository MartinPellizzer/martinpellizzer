                    <h1>Medicago denticulata var. apiculata</h1>
<p>Medicago denticulata var. apiculata, commonly known as the slender medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along waterways. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
