<p>Melocactus caesius subsp.</p>
<p>lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's melon cactus, is a compact, cylindrical cactus native to the Andes of South America. It features a ribbed, spiny stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
