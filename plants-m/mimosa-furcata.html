                    <h1>Mimosa furcata</h1>
<p>Mimosa furcata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Mimosa furcata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings.</p>
