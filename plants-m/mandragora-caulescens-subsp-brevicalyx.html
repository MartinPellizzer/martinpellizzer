<p>Mandragora caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed mandrake, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive, lobed shape, while its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is primarily found in its natural habitat.</p>
