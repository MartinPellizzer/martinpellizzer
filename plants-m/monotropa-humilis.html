                    <h1>Monotropa humilis</h1>
<p>Monotropa humilis, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Monotropa humilis is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory.</p>
