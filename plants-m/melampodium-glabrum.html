                    <h1>Melampodium glabrum</h1>
<p>Melampodium glabrum, commonly known as the blackfoot daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow to orange daisy-like flowers. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's name comes from the Greek words "melas" meaning black and "podos" meaning foot, referring to the dark, velvety appearance of its stems.</p>
