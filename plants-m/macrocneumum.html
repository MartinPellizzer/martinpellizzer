<p>Macrocneumum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically broad and rounded. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with small, delicate rhizomes that help anchor it in the substrate.</p>
<p>Macrocneumum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
