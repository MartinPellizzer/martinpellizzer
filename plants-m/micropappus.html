                    <h1>Micropappus</h1>
<p>Micropappus, commonly known as the desert star or goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and the presence of a pappus, a structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Micropappus species often have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
