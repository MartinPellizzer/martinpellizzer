<p>Microstylis dempoensis, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small-styled grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Microstylis dempoensis is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
