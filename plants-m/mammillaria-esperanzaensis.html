<p>Mammillaria esperanzaensis, commonly known as the Esperanza Mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to light green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
