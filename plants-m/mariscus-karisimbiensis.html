                    <h1>Mariscus karisimbiensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus karisimbiensis, commonly known as the Karisimbi marshmallow, is a rare flowering plant native to the montane regions of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and nutrient-poor environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
