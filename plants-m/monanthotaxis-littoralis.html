                    <h1>Monanthotaxis littoralis</h1>
<p>Monanthotaxis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal monanthotaxis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
