                    <h1>Microsorum sylvaticum</h1>
<p>Microsorum sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually.</p>
<p>The fronds are often divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
