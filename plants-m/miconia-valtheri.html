<p>Miconia valtheri, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. Miconia valtheri is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
