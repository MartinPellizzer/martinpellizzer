<p>Mimosa hassleriana subsp.</p>
<p>microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are small and bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as the leaves fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species.</p>
