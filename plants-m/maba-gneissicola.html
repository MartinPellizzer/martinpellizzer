                    <h1>Maba gneissicola</h1>
<p>Maba gneissicola, commonly known as the gneiss rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species that thrives in rocky, gneissic substrates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals, typical of many orchid species. It is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and requires specific moisture and light conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
