<p>Munnozia liaboides, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
