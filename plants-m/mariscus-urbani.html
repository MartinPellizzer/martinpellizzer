<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mariscus urbani is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
