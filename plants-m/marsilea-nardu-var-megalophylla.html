<p>Marsilea nardu var. megalophylla, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being broad and floating on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
