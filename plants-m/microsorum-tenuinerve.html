<p>Microsorum tenuinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water, though it can also be found in moist terrestrial environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a distinct, narrow vein pattern that gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Microsorum tenuinerve is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic conditions.</p>
