                    <h1>Microlepia marginata var. villosa</h1>
<p>Microlepia marginata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'villosa' refers to the hairy texture of its fronds, a key identifying feature.</p>
