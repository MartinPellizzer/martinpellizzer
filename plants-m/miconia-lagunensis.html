<p>Miconia lagunensis, commonly known as the Guianese miconia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia lagunensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem, though its spread can disrupt native plant communities.</p>
