                    <h1>Megalastrum kallooi</h1>
<p>Megalastrum kallooi, commonly known as the Kalloo's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
