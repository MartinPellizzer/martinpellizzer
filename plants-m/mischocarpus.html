                    <h1>Mischocarpus</h1>
<p>Mischocarpus, commonly known as the copal tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae.</p>
<p>These trees are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The fruit is a globose, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant produces a resinous sap known as copal.</p>
<p>Mischocarpus species are valued for their timber, ornamental qualities, and the use of their resin in traditional and modern applications.</p>
