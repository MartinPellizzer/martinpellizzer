<p>Moutabea acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's moutabea, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moutabea acostae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological studies.</p>
