<p>Masdevallia rosea subsp.</p>
<p>echinata, commonly known as the spiny masdevallia, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant rose-pink petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a subtle sheen.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as a miniature epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are short-lived but striking, often appearing in clusters during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
