                    <h1>Melaleuca leucadendra var. coriacea</h1>
<p>Melaleuca leucadendra var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
