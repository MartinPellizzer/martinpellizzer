                    <h1>Mimosa retortunium</h1>
<p>Mimosa retortunium, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa retortunium is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and unique movement.</p>
