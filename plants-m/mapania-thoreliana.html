                    <h1>Mapania thoreliana</h1>
<p>Mapania thoreliana, commonly known as the Thorelian's mapania, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
