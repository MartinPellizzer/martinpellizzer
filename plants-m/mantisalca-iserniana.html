                    <h1>Mantisalca iserniana</h1>
<p>Mantisalca iserniana, commonly known as the Isernia mantis orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that resemble the wings of a praying mantis, giving it its common name. Its blooms, which can be white, pink, or purple, are typically produced in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mantisalca iserniana is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
