<p>Mollugo denticulata, commonly known as the toothed mossyweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help retain moisture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Mollugo denticulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
