                    <h1>Myrmecodia armata</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia armata, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the plant from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
