<p>Minuartia campestris subsp.</p>
<p>aequalis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Its succulent stems help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in alpine and maritime regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
