<p>Microlicia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Microlicia serpyllifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
