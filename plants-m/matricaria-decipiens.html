                    <h1>Matricaria decipiens</h1>
<p>Matricaria decipiens, commonly known as chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant grows up to 30 cm tall, with linear, grass-like leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. Chamomile is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in herbal medicine and aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its deceptive appearance, as it resembles other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>
