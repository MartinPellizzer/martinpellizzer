<p>Melica caerulea, commonly known as blue brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually blue or purplish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Melica caerulea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
