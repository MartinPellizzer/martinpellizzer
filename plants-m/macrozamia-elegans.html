                    <h1>Macrozamia elegans</h1>
<p>Macrozamia elegans, commonly known as the elegant cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
