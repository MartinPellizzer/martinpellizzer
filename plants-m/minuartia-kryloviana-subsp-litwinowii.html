<p>Minuartia kryloviana subsp.</p>
<p>litwinowii, commonly known as the Siberian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, contributing to the ecological stability of these extreme habitats.</p>
