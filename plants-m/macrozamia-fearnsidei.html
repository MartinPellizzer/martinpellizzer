                    <h1>Macrozamia fearnsidei</h1>
<p>Macrozamia fearnsidei, commonly known as the Fearnside cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its seeds are enclosed in a thick, woody sarcocarp, which can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Macrozamia fearnsidei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
