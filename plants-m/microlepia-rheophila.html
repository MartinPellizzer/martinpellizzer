<p>Microlepia rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found along stream banks and in humid forests. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wet soil substrates.</p>
<p>Microlepia rheophila plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
