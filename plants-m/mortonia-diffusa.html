                    <h1>Mortonia diffusa</h1>
<p>Mortonia diffusa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It features slender, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its reproductive system relies on spore dispersal, typical of ferns, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
