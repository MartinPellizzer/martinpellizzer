<p>Mollugo spathulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a common sight in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soil.</p>
