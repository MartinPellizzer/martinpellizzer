<p>Melampyrum delphinense, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that surround its small, yellowish flowers. Native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
