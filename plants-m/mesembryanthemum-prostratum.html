<p>Mesembryanthemum prostratum, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, prostrate stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often covering the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum prostratum is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
