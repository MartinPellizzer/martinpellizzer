<p>Marsilea distorta, commonly known as the distorted water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, four-leaf clover-like structures that are often distorted or asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically submerged, with small, scale-like fronds that aid in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Marsilea distorta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
