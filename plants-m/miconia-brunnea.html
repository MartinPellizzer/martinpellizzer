                    <h1>Miconia brunnea</h1>
<p>Miconia brunnea, commonly known as the black miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Miconia brunnea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its prolific seed dispersal and dense growth habit.</p>
