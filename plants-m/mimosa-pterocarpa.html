                    <h1>Mimosa pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa pterocarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells called pulvini. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
