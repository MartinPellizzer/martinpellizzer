<p>Monophyllorchis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
