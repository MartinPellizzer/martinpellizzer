<p>Monandraira, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. Monandraira has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and birds, making it an important part of the local ecosystem.</p>
