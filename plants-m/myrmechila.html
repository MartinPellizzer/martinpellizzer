<p>Myrmechila, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and white, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Myrmechila is native to Australia and is often found in woodland and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for various native birds and insects.</p>
