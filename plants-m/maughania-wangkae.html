                    <h1>Maughania wangkae</h1>
<p>Maughania wangkae, commonly known as the Wangkae cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Maughania wangkae is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution and ecology of cycad species in the region.</p>
