                    <h1>Marojejya insignis</h1>
<p>Marojejya insignis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique and ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a thick, woody trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are adapted to specific pollination mechanisms. Marojejya insignis is considered a relic of the prehistoric flora and is highly valued for its ecological and scientific significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also listed as critically endangered.</p>
