<p>Musa × paradisiaca subsp.</p>
<p>troglodytarum, commonly known as the cave banana, is a subspecies of the banana plant characterized by its unique adaptation to subterranean environments. It possesses thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and water, enabling survival in dark, humid cave systems.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad and robust, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in low-light conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a structure that facilitates pollination by cave-dwelling insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and ecological niche.</p>
