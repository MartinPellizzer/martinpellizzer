                    <h1>Miconia cremadena</h1>
<p>Miconia cremadena, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds.</p>
