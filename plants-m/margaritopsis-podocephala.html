<p>Margaritopsis podocephala, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a short rhizome with a single, erect stem that bears a single flower cluster. Its leaves are often small, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Margaritopsis podocephala is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
