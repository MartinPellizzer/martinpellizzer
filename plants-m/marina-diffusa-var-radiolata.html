                    <h1>Marina diffusa var. radiolata</h1>
<p>Marina diffusa var. radiolata, commonly known as the Radiolate Sea Fig, is a rare coastal plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems can store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, saline conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected coastal reserves.</p>
