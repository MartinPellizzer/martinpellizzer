                            <h1>Milium Capillare</h1>
<p>Goosegrass, scientifically known as Milium capillare, is a common weed found in lawns and disturbed soils across temperate regions. It thrives in moist environments and is often mistaken for grass due to its slender, grass-like appearance. Despite its invasive tendencies, goosegrass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects. Its tiny, spike-like flowers appear in clusters, making it a unique subject for botanical study. Though often viewed as a nuisance, goosegrass has ecological value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
