                    <h1>Minuartia pseudoimbricata</h1>
<p>Minuartia pseudoimbricata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It often grows on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and among stones, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
