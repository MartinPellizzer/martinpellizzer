<p>Myristica beddomei subsp.</p>
<p>beddomei, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that produces aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often leathery and have a distinct scent. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and is of conservation concern.</p>
