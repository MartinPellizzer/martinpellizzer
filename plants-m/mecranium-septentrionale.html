<p>Mecranium septentrionale, commonly known as the northern mecranium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
