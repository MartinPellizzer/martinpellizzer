<p>Miconia capitellata, commonly known as the "Brazilian cherry" or "red miconia," is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Miconia capitellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers.</p>
