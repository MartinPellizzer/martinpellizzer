                    <h1>Myristica subglobosa</h1>
<p>Myristica subglobosa, commonly known as the globular nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by unique, three-lobed fruits that enclose the aromatic seeds used for culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a close relative of the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, and its ecological importance in tropical ecosystems.</p>
