                    <h1>Melliodendron xylocarpum var. roseolum</h1>
<p>Melliodendron xylocarpum var. roseolum, commonly known as the rose-colored ironwood, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant features compound leaves with glossy, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat.</p>
