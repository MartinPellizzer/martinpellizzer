                    <h1>Microstylis incurviforceps</h1>
<p>Microstylis incurviforceps, commonly known as the curved-stylus orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, slender stems and intricate, often fragrant flowers with a unique, recurved lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by small insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
