                    <h1>Marianthus granulatus</h1>
<p>Marianthus granulatus, commonly known as the granulated marianthus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, granular texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Marianthus granulatus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
