                    <h1>Miconia triantha</h1>
<p>Miconia triantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracteate flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread in the region. Miconia triantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
