<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with specialized structures for attaching to and extracting nutrients from its host.</p>
