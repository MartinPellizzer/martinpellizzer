                    <h1>Melica californica</h1>
<p>Melica californica, commonly known as California wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as streambanks and meadows, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
