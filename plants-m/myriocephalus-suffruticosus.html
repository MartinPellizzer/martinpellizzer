<p>Myriocephalus suffruticosus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Myriocephalus suffruticosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
