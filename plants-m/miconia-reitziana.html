<p>Miconia reitziana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing numerous seeds.
