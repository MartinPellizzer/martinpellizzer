                    <h1>Mimosa humivagans</h1>
<p>Mimosa humivagans, commonly known as the sticky mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its stems are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Mimosa humivagans is often found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in prairie habitats.</p>
