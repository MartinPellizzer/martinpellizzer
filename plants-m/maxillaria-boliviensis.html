<p>Maxillaria boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian maxillaria, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports several leaves and flower spikes. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Maxillaria boliviensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
