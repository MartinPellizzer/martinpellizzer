                    <h1>Mazus stachydifolius</h1>
<p>Mazus stachydifolius, commonly known as the sticky mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
