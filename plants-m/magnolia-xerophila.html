                    <h1>Magnolia xerophila</h1>
<p>Magnolia xerophila, commonly known as the desert magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
