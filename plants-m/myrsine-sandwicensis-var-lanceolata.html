<p>Myrsine sandwicensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Koa ‘Akiapola‘au, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate,革质 (leathery) leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
