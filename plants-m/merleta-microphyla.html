<p>Merleta microphyla, commonly known as the tiny leaf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Merleta microphyla is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
