                    <h1>Micrampelis glutinosa</h1>
<p>Micrampelis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky climbing plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores. Small white to pale yellow flowers are produced in clusters, and the plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique adhesive properties and climbing habit make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
