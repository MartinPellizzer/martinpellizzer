                    <h1>Mimosa tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Mimosa tenuiflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open savannas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational demonstrations.</p>
