<p>Mundulea millettii, commonly known as the spinifex tree, is a small, drought-resistant shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Mundulea millettii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its ecosystem.</p>
