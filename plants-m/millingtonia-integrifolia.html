<p>Millingtonia integrifolia, commonly known as the satinwood or white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are entire and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas.</p>
<p>Millingtonia integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities.</p>
