                    <h1>Miconia mendoncaei</h1>
<p>Miconia mendoncaei, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are typically smaller and less commonly consumed than the commercial starfruit. Miconia mendoncaei is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
