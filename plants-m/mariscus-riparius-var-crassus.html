                    <h1>Mariscus riparius var. crassus</h1>
<p>Mariscus riparius var. crassus, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its robust growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
