                    <h1>Minuartia densiflora</h1>
<p>Minuartia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually scale-like or very narrow, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Minuartia densiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
