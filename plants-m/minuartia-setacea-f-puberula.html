                    <h1>Minuartia setacea f. puberula</h1>
<p>Minuartia setacea f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to rocky or alpine environments in Europe and Asia. The leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a pubescent (hairy) surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces.</p>
