                    <h1>Mitracarpus haitiensis</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian mitracarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It produces small, dry fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, and its ornamental value has led to some horticultural interest.</p>
<p>However, it remains relatively obscure in botanical studies compared to more widespread members of its family.</p>
