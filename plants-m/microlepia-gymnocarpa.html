<p>Microlepia gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microlepia gymnocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
