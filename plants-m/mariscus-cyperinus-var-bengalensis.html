                    <h1>Mariscus cyperinus var. bengalensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus cyperinus var. bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is native to wetland environments in South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, often saline soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in marshes, tidal flats, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
