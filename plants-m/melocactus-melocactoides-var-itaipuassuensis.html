<p>Melocactus melocactoides var. itaipuassuensis, commonly known as the Itaipuassuensis melocactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that often develops a swollen base, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in areas with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
