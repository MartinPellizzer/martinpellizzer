                    <h1>Mammillaria jozef-bergeri</h1>
<p>Mammillaria jozef-bergeri, commonly known as the Jozef-Berger's mammillaria, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with white to pale green tubercles, which are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
