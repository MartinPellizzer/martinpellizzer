The plant produces dense spikes of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
