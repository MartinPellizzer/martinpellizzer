                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum hirtum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum hirtum, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care.</p>
