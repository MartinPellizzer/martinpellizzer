                <h1>Marsilea vestita</h1>
<p>Marsilea vestita, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Marsilea vestita is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
