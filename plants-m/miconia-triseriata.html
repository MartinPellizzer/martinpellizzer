                    <h1>Miconia triseriata</h1>
<p>Miconia triseriata, commonly known as the three-lobed miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
