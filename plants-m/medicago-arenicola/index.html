                            <h1>Medicago Arenicola</h1>
<p>Medicago arenicola is a resilient flowering plant commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and inland deserts. This legume has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Despite its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
