<p>Matucana haynii subsp.</p>
<p>herzogiana, commonly known as the Herzog's matucana, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of dark green, narrow leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
