                    <h1>Marsilea macrocarpa var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Marsilea macrocarpa var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected water clover, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, clover-like leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant's leaves are typically submerged, with some floating leaves that help in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures include small, floating spore cases that release spores into the water.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more intricate leaf dissection compared to other Marsilea species.</p>
