<p>Medicago papillosa subsp.</p>
<p>papillosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is used in forage and cover crops.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is capable of nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
