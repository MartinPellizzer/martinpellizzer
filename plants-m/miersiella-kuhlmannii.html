                    <h1>Miersiella kuhlmannii</h1>
<p>Miersiella kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark yellowish-green thallus, which is typically covered with a thin, continuous cortex. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, primarily from the genus Xanthoria. It thrives in dry, sunny environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree bark in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the lichen community.</p>
