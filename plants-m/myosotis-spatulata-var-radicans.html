                    <h1>Myosotis spatulata var. radicans</h1>
<p>Myosotis spatulata var. radicans, commonly known as the spreading forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Myosotis genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
