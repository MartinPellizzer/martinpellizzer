                    <h1>Montia calcicola</h1>
<p>Montia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils, often found in desert or sagebrush habitats. The plant has small, fleshy, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are adapted for water storage. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Montia calcicola is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of specific ecological conditions.</p>
