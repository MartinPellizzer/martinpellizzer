                    <h1>Minyranthes heterophylla</h1>
<p>Minyranthes heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water shield, is a aquatic plant found in freshwater wetlands and shallow lakes.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology varies depending on environmental conditions, hence its common name.</p>
