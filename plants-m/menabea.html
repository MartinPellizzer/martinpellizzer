                    <h1>Menabea</h1>
<p>Menabea, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Madagascar, is a unique aquatic plant with striking blue and purple flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate. Its flowers open in the early morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Menabea plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
