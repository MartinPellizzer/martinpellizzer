<p>Melampyrum lineare f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it the specific epithet "stenophyllum.".</p>
<p>It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
