                    <h1>Manfreda</h1>
<p>Manfreda, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Agavaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and rocky environments. Manfreda species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a powdery coating to reduce water loss. They produce striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts and xeriscaping gardeners.</p>
