<p>Monteverdia fugax, commonly known as the fleeting monteverdia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant has a short blooming period, typically in the spring, making it a fleeting spectacle in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a slightly succulent texture, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Monteverdia fugax is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
