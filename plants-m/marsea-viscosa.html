<p>Marsea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky marsea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Marsea viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to dry climates.</p>
