                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum incurvatum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum incurvatum, commonly known as the curled iceplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that curl inward when dry, a feature that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum incurvatum is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
