<p>Marginaria fallax, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Marginaria fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or arid environments.</p>
