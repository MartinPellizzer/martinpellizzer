<p>Macropanax dispermus, commonly known as the two-seeded arum, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, which is a distinguishing feature contributing to its scientific name. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Macropanax dispermus is critically important for conservation efforts in its native ecosystem.</p>
