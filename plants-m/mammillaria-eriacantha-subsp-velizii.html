<p>Mammillaria eriacantha subsp.</p>
<p>velizii, commonly known as the Veliz's milk barrel cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular stem with white, woolly areoles that bear short, white bristles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
