                    <h1>Micromeria fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Micromeria fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Micromeria fruticulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
