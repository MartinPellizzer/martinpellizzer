                    <h1>Metabasis</h1>
<p>Metabasis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a cluster of bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Metabasis is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but has distinct botanical traits.</p>
