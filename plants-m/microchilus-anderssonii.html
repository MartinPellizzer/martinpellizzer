<p>Microchilus anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in cool, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
