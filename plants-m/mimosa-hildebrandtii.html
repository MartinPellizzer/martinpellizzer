<p>Mimosa hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold together when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Mimosa hildebrandtii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
