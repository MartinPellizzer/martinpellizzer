                    <h1>Mondo japonicum var. griffithii</h1>
<p>Mondo japonicum var. griffithii, commonly known as the golden mondo grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a distinctive golden hue along the leaf edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the standard mondo grass, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
