                    <h1>Miconia shaferi</h1>
<p>Miconia shaferi, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are usually glossy and can be quite broad, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
