<p>Mediocalcar longipes, commonly known as the long-footed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mediocalcar longipes plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in coastal and desert scrub habitats.</p>
