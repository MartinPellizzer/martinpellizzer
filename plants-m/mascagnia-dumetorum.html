                    <h1>Mascagnia dumetorum</h1>
<p>Mascagnia dumetorum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low water conditions. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Mascagnia dumetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
