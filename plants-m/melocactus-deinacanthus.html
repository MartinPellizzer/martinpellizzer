<p>Melocactus deinacanthus, commonly known as the golden melon cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, globose stem covered with dense, spiny areoles and bright yellow to orange spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round, green fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
