                    <h1>Melanaton</h1>
<p>Melanaton, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, followed by berries that start green and ripen to a deep black. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
