                    <h1>Myristica rumphii var. florentis</h1>
<p>Myristica rumphii var. florentis, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits containing the aromatic seeds used as spices. The seeds, known as nutmeg, are enclosed within a toxic, reddish aril, and the tree also yields mace, a spice derived from the aril's outer covering.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its economic importance in the spice trade and its ecological role in tropical forests.</p>
