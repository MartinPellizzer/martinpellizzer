<p>Misopates nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or pink berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stem, which attaches to the host tree. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Misopates nanum is typically found in temperate regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
