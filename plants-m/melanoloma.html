                    <h1>Melanoloma</h1>
<p>Melanoloma, commonly known as a type of melanoma, is a malignant skin tumor that arises from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by irregularly shaped, dark-colored lesions that can appear on sun-exposed areas of the body. Botanically, it is not a plant but a cancerous growth, so it does not have the typical botanical features such as roots, stems, or leaves. However, its study is important in botany-related fields such as plant pathology and phytochemistry.</p>
<p>Melanoloma is often associated with UV radiation exposure and can be a serious health concern if not detected early.</p>
