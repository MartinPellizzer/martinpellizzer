                    <h1>Macleania subsessilis</h1>
<p>Macleania subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives on a variety of host trees, including oaks and hickories. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
