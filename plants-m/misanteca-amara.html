                <h1>Misanteca amara</h1>
<p>Misanteca amara, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a perennial plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance.</p>
<p>The plant's name reflects both its bitterness and its association with the night, as it thrives in shady, moist environments.</p>
