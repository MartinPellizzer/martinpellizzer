                    <h1>Mammillaria pretiosa var. cristata</h1>
<p>Mammillaria pretiosa var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate mammillaria, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, crown-like growth pattern, known as a "cristate" form, which results from a genetic mutation. The plant features short, spiny stems covered in white or pale green areoles, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and unusual appearance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
