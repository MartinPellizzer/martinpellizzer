                    <h1>Mimosa sicyocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa sicyocarpa, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flattened, pod-like fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa sicyocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
