                    <h1>Mitrastylus parkeri</h1>
<p>Mitrastylus parkeri, commonly known as the mountain mistywood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with dense, dark green foliage that provides habitat for various small animals and insects. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid, shaded environment it inhabits.</p>
<p>Mitrastylus parkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native rainforest ecosystems.</p>
