                    <h1>Microlepia puberula var. pilosior</h1>
<p>Microlepia puberula var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
