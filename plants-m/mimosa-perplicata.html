<p>Mimosa perplicata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa perplicata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique movement and aesthetic appeal.</p>
