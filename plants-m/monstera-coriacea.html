<p>Monstera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaf monstera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that are often rough to the touch due to their thick, leathery texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves can reach up to 1 meter in length and are known for their distinctive, almost shield-like shape.</p>
<p>Monstera coriacea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush foliage.</p>
