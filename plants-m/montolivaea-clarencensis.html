                    <h1>Montolivaea clarencensis</h1>
<p>Montolivaea clarencensis, commonly known as the Clarencian bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of southern France.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils along the cliffs and shores. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Montolivaea clarencensis is considered critically endangered and is protected under various conservation programs.</p>
