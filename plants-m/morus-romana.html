                    <h1>Morus romana</h1>
<p>Morus romana, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the upper surface and white on the underside. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called syconia, which are typically pink to red in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its role in the production of silk, as its leaves are a primary food source for silkworms.</p>
