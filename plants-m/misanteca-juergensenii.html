                    <h1>Misanteca juergensenii</h1>
<p>Misanteca juergensenii, commonly known as the Jergensen's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its berries are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Misanteca juergensenii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity through its interactions with animals and its role in the forest canopy.</p>
