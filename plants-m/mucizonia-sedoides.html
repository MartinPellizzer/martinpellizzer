<p>Mucizonia sedoides, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a robust stem with rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces seeds enclosed in a tough, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Mucizonia sedoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
