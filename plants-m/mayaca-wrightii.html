                    <h1>Mayaca wrightii</h1>
<p>Mayaca wrightii, commonly known as Wright's mayaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Mayaca wrightii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support local biodiversity.</p>
