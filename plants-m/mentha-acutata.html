<p>Mentha acutata, commonly known as sharp mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>

The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha acutata has a strong, sharp mint aroma due to its high concentration of volatile oils, particularly menthone and pulegone.</p>
