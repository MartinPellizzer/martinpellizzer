                    <h1>Medicago microdon</h1>
<p>Medicago microdon, commonly known as the small medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, globular pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Medicago microdon is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and soil health.</p>
