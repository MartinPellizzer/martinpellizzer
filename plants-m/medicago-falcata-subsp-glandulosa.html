<p>Medicago falcata subsp.</p>
<p>glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular goatweed, is a perennial forage plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its adaptation to arid environments.</p>
