                    <h1>Mariscus phaeocephalus</h1>
<p>Mariscus phaeocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed mariscus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive dark purple to black flower heads, which give it its common name. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mariscus phaeocephalus is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
