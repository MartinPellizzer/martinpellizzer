                    <h1>Mogiphanes flavescens</h1>
<p>Mogiphanes flavescens, commonly known as the golden flame cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, yellowish-brown spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and enabling survival in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Mogiphanes flavescens is well adapted to low-water conditions, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
