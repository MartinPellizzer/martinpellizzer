<p>Melica ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>bauhini, commonly known as the silky meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue along the edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its common name.</p>
