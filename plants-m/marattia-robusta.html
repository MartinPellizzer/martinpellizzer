                    <h1>Marattia robusta</h1>
<p>Marattia robusta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Marattia robusta plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
