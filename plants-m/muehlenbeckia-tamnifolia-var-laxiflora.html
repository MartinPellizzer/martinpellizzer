<p>Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia var. laxiflora, commonly known as the silver hair plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems covered in dense, silvery-white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and also hairy, contributing to its overall silvery hue. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
