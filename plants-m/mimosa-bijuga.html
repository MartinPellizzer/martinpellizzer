                    <h1>Mimosa bijuga</h1>
<p>Mimosa bijuga, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Mimosa bijuga is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine.</p>
