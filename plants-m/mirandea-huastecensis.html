<p>Mirandea huastecensis, commonly known as the Huastec mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying plant-parasite relationships.</p>
