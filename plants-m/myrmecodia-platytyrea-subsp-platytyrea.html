<p>Myrmecodia platytyrea subsp.</p>
<p>platytyrea, commonly known as the shield tree or honeycomb plant, is a unique member of the Bignoniaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, honeycomb-like structures on its stems, which are formed by the growth of fungal mycelium.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants.</p>
