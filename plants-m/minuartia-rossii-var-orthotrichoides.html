<p>Minuartia rossii var. orthotrichoides, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, crust-like growth habit. The plant is typically green to yellowish in color, with a dense, leaf-like structure that helps it retain moisture. It is often found growing on bare rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme habitats.</p>
