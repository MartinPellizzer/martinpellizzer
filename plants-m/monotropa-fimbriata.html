<p>Monotropa fimbriata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the roots of trees. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often remain evergreen throughout the year.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is sometimes called the "dancing ghost" due to its ethereal appearance.</p>
