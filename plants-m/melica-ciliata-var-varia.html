<p>Melica ciliata var. varia, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine cilia, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
