                    <h1>Melocactus crassicostatus</h1>
<p>Melocactus crassicostatus, commonly known as the thick-shelled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered with dense, white spines that provide protection from both herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Its thick, ribbed structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, desert environment.</p>
<p>The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
