                    <h1>Microchilus utriculatus</h1>
<p>Microchilus utriculatus, commonly known as the bladder snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is characterized by its small, shell-like body covered in a calcareous mantle. This plant-like organism is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. The shell serves as both a protective structure and a means of gas exchange.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
