<p>Melaleuca williamsii subsp.</p>
<p>synoriensis, commonly known as the Northern Territory melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, rough, and often greyish bark, which exudes a strong scent when broken.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of the Northern Territory.</p>
