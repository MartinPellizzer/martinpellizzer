                    <h1>Melodorum chloroneurum</h1>
<p>Melodorum chloroneurum, commonly known as the blue-green orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique combination of blue and green hues in its petals and sepals, which are often described as iridescent. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the dappled light beneath the canopy. Its flowers are small but numerous, arranged in dense clusters that add to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range.</p>
