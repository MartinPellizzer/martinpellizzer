                    <h1>Myrmecodia lamii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia lamii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia lamii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest.</p>
