                    <h1>Myricaria germanica var. squamosa</h1>
<p>Myricaria germanica var. squamosa, commonly known as the squamosa myricaria, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense covering of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological resilience.</p>
