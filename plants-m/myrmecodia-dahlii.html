                    <h1>Myrmecodia dahlii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia dahlii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia dahlii is prized in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
