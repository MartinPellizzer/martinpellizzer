                    <h1>Myrtus communis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Myrtus communis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Myrtus communis. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited to coastal areas due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils.</p>
