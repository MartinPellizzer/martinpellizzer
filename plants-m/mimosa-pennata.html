                    <h1>Mimosa pennata</h1>
<p>Mimosa pennata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Mimosa pennata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
