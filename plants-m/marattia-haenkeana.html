                    <h1>Marattia haenkeana</h1>
<p>Marattia haenkeana, commonly known as the Haenke's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of the Lephtaliopteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
