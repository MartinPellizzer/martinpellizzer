                    <h1>Mammillaria autumnalis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny, tuberculate stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the autumn season, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Mammillaria autumnalis is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
