                    <h1>Medicago helix var. spinosa</h1>
<p>Medicago helix var. spinosa, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and distinctive spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
