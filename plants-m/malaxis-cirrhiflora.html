                    <h1>Malaxis cirrhiflora</h1>
<p>Malaxis cirrhiflora, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are fibrous, and it has a rhizome that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light conditions, with narrow leaves and a compact growth habit.</p>
