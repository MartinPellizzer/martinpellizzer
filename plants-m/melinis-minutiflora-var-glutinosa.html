<p>Melinis minutiflora var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a sticky, waxy substance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
