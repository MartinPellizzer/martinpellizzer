<p>Mesosphaerum lachnosphaerium, commonly known as the smooth-sphere liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. The plant's leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a compact rosette, which helps reduce water loss. It produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum lachnosphaerium plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
