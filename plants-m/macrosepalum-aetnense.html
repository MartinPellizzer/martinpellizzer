                    <h1>Macrosepalum aetnense</h1>
<p>Macrosepalum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated sepals and petals that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red and orange. The plant thrives in the nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the volcano. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
