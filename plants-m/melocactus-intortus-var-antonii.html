                    <h1>Melocactus intortus var. antonii</h1>
<p>Melocactus intortus var. antonii, commonly known as the twisted melon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraled stems that twist and curl as it grows, forming a compact, globular shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens due to its striking appearance.</p>
