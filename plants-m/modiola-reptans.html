<p>Modiola reptans, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Modiola reptans plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
