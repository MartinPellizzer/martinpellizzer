<p>Malaxis monophyllos subsp.</p>
<p>brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded environments with moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a subtle fragrance, and are clustered in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations to its wetland environment and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
