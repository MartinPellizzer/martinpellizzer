                    <h1>Meconopsis integrifolia var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Meconopsis integrifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically on tall, slender stems. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, adapted to the cold, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat sensitivity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens but remains rare in the wild.</p>
