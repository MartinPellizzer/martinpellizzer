<p>Medicago tribuloides var. truncatula, commonly known as the narrowleaf burclover, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as a food source for various insects and livestock.</p>
