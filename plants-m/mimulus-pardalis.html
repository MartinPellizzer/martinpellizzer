<p>Mimulus pardalis, commonly known as the golden mimic, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble those of the common yellow water lily, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.</p>
<p>Mimulus pardalis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its abundant nectar-rich blooms.</p>
