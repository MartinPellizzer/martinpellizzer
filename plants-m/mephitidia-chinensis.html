                    <h1>Mephitidia chinensis</h1>
<p>Mephitidia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong, aromatic resin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and mammals. It is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The Chinese yew is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
