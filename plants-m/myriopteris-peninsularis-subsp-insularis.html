<p>Myriopteris peninsularis subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
