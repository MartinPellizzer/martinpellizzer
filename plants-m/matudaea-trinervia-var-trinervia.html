<p>Matudaea trinervia var. trinervia, commonly known as the mountain spider-orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct three-veined structure, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
