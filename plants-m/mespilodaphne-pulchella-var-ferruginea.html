<p>Mespilodaphne pulchella var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-flowered mespilodaphne, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and distinctive, rust-colored floral bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
