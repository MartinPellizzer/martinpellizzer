                    <h1>Marmaroxylon ramiflorum</h1>
<p>Marmaroxylon ramiflorum, commonly known as the desert sand-wood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
