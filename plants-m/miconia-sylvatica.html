<p>Miconia sylvatica, commonly known as the evergreen miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits.
