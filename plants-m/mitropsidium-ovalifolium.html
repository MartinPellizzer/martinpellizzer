<p>Mitropsidium ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
