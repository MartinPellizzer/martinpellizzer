<p>Masdevallia ortalis, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, and the inflorescence is a raceme of small, showy blooms.</p>
<p>Masdevallia ortalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
