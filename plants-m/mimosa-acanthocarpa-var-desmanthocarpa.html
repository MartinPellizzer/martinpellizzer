<p>Mimosa acanthocarpa var. desmanthocarpa, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems with small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
