                    <h1>Multidentia saxicola</h1>
<p>Multidentia saxicola, commonly known as the rock mullein, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
