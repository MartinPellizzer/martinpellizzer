                    <h1>Madorella dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Madorella dissitiflora, commonly known as the crested flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered in a dense, rounded shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
