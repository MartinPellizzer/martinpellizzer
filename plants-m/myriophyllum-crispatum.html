                    <h1>Myriophyllum crispatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum crispatum, commonly known as the curly pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often curled or crisped at the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic life. It produces small, green flowers that float on the water surface, which are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum crispatum is often used in pond restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water clarity.</p>
