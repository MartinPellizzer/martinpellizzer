<p>Minuartia mutabilis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
