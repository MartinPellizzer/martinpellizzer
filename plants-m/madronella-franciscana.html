                    <h1>Madronella franciscana</h1>
<p>Madronella franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan madrona, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the coast, where it is adapted to coastal climates with high salt spray. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some areas.</p>
