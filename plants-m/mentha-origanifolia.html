                    <h1>Mentha origanifolia</h1>
<p>Mentha origanifolia, commonly known as lemon mint, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves emit a strong, lemony scent when crushed, due to the presence of high concentrations of menthone and other volatile oils.</p>
<p>Mentha origanifolia is often used in herbal teas and culinary applications for its refreshing flavor and aromatic properties.</p>
