                    <h1>Marsilea drummondii var. sericea</h1>
<p>Marsilea drummondii var. sericea, commonly known as the silky water clover, is a aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It has small, floating leaves that are divided into four leaflets, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaf surfaces, which give it its varietal name.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
