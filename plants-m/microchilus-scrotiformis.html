<p>Microchilus scrotiformis, commonly known as the bladder bladder or bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family.</p>
<p>Microchilus scrotiformis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival.</p>
