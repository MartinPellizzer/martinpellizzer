                    <h1>Marsilea strigosa</h1>
<p>Marsilea strigosa, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used as a decorative element in ponds and water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, floating spores that are released into the water, allowing for widespread dispersal.</p>
<p>Marsilea strigosa is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts.</p>
