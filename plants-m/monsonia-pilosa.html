                    <h1>Monsonia pilosa</h1>
<p>Monsonia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly monsonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
