                    <h1>Mitracarpus frigidus var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus frigidus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous frosty mitracarpus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its fruit is a schizocarp, splitting into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It is typically found in rocky, alpine regions where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
