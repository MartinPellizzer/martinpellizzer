<p>Moniera caprarioides, commonly known as the climbing dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange color and tendril-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and can be found growing on various woody plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
