<p>Mammillaria elongata var. erecta, commonly known as the tall hedgehog cactus, is a compact cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, elongated tubercles that give it a distinctive spiny appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate, it is ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
