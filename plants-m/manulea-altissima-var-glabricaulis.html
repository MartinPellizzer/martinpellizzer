<p>Manulea altissima var. glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed manulea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairless texture. The plant produces delicate, pale green flowers that bloom during the cooler months, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
