                    <h1>Myrmecodia vivipara</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia vivipara, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical epiphytic species belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces viviparous structures called "pseudo-galls" that contain fully developed offspring, which can detach and establish new plants. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia vivipara thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
