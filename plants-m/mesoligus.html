<p>Mesoligus, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it reflect sunlight in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Mesoligus is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
