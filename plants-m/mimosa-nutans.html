                    <h1>Mimosa nutans</h1>
<p>Mimosa nutans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, spiny pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Mimosa nutans thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats.</p>
