                    <h1>Myroxylon dussii</h1>
<p>Myroxylon dussii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its rich color and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Myroxylon dussii thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and requires a warm, moist climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
