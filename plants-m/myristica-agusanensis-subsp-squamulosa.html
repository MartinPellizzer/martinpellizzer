<p>Myristica agusanensis subsp.</p>
<p>squamulosa, commonly known as the Agusan nutmeg, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, oily seeds that resemble those of the more well-known nutmeg.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests and is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential for conservation and its role in the region's biodiversity.</p>
