                    <h1>Melica secunda var. interrupta</h1>
<p>Melica secunda var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often lie close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its interrupted flowering pattern, where some spikelets are absent, giving it its common name.</p>
