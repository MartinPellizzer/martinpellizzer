                    <h1>Merkusia depauperata</h1>
<p>Merkusia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its ecological niche and its role in the study of orchid evolution.</p>
