                    <h1>Myricaria germanica var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Myricaria germanica var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate myricaria, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, reducing water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
