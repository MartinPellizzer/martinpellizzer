                    <h1>Myristica fatua var. sangowoensis</h1>
<p>Myristica fatua var. sangowoensis, commonly known as the Sangowo nutmeg, is a rare and less-studied variant of the nutmeg tree native to the Indonesian island of Sangowo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown seeds that resemble those of the more well-known nutmeg. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is valued for its unique spice, which is used in traditional medicine and culinary applications.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
