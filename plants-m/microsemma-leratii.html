<p>Microsemma leratii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved microsemma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Microsemma leratii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
