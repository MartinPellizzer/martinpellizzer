                    <h1>Merkusia humilis</h1>
<p>Merkusia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf merkusia, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
