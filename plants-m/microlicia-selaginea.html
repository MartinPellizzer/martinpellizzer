                    <h1>Microlicia selaginea</h1>
<p>Microlicia selaginea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like appearance, with small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks or branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Microlicia selaginea is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
