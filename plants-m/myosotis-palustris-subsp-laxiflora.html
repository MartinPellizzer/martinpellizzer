<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>laxiflora, commonly known as the bog forget-me-not, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers with five petals, typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
