<p>Mortoniopteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a distinctive visual appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
