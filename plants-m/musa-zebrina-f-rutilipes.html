                    <h1>Musa zebrina f. rutilipes</h1>
<p>Musa zebrina f. rutilipes, commonly known as the golden zebra plant, is a hybrid banana plant characterized by its striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves feature a mix of green, white, and yellow patterns, creating a visually appealing appearance. The plant is a member of the Musaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value rather than its fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution in the leaves.</p>
