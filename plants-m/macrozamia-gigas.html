                    <h1>Macrozamia gigas</h1>
<p>Macrozamia gigas, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, palm-like trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
