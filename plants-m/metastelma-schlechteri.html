                    <h1>Metastelma schlechteri</h1>
<p>Metastelma schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's metastelma, is a rare and little-studied member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and brightly colored, ranging from pink to red, with five lobes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
