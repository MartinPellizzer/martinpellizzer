                    <h1>Molinia caerulea proles depauperata</h1>
<p>Molinia caerulea proles depauperata, commonly known as the poor grass moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of spikelets that are often blue-green in color. It is characterized by its reduced inflorescence compared to the typical form of Molinia caerulea.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to specific environmental conditions.</p>
