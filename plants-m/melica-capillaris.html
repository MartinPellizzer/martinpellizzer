<p>Melica capillaris, commonly known as slender brome, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Melica capillaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
