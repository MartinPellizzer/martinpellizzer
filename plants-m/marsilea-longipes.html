<p>Marsilea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed water clover, is a aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
