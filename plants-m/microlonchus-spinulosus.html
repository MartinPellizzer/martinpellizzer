                    <h1>Microlonchus spinulosus</h1>
<p>Microlonchus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in membranous, inflated seed coats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, spinose hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Microlonchus spinulosus is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
