<p>Miconia circumscissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
