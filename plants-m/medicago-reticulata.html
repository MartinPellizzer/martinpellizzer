                    <h1>Medicago reticulata</h1>
<p>Medicago reticulata, commonly known as the honey vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving fertility for subsequent crops.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems and seed pods contribute to its role in forage and wildlife habitat.</p>
