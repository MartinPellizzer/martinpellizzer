                    <h1>Micrasepalum eritrichoides</h1>
<p>Micrasepalum eritrichoides, commonly known as the small-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Micrasepalum eritrichoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
