                    <h1>Metastelma eliasianum</h1>
<p>Metastelma eliasianum, commonly known as the Eliasian metaphytes, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
