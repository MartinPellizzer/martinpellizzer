<p>Megyathus acetabulosum, commonly known as the bladderleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Megyathus acetabulosum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and mountain meadows.</p>
