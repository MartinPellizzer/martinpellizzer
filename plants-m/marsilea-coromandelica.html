<p>Marsilea coromandelica, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that float on the water surface, with delicate, thread-like roots submerged in the water. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including India, and is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on stalks and release spores into the water for propagation.</p>
<p>Marsilea coromandelica plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
