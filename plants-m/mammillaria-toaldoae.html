<p>Mammillaria toaldoae, commonly known as the Toaldo's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
