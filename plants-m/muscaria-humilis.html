                    <h1>Muscaria humilis</h1>
<p>Muscaria humilis, commonly known as the common puffball, is a small, edible mushroom with a distinctive white, spongy cap that turns yellowish as it matures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Agaricaceae and is characterized by its lack of gills, instead having a porous, sponge-like structure beneath its cap. The fruiting body typically grows up to 5 cm in diameter and is often found in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is an important species in fungal ecology, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest soils.</p>
<p>However, it should not be confused with toxic look-alikes, as some species within the same genus can be harmful to consume.</p>
