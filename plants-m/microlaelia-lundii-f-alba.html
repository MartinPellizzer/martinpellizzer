                    <h1>Microlaelia lundii f. alba</h1>
<p>Microlaelia lundii f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered microlaelia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>This hybrid form exhibits pure white petals, a stark contrast to the typical pink or red hues of its parent species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from October to February.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
