<p>Mammillaria grandis, commonly known as the giant mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its dense, spiny structure helps it retain water and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Mammillaria grandis is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience.</p>
