<p>Myrtus rhopaloides, commonly known as the coastal myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries are dark blue or black when ripe and are edible, though they are often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Myrtus rhopaloides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
