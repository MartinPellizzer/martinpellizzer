                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys var. californica</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys var. californica, commonly known as the California ghostplant, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as coniferous forests and is often found growing through the foliage of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for forest health.</p>
