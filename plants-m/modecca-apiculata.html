                    <h1>Modecca apiculata</h1>
<p>Modecca apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Modecca apiculata is often found in xeric environments, such as sandy or limestone soils, and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
