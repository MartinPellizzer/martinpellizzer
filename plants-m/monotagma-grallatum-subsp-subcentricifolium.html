<p>Monotagma grallatum subsp.</p>
<p>subcentricifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds. It attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while also photosynthesizing to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit and ecological role, it plays an important part in the ecosystems where it is found.</p>
