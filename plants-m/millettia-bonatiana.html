                    <h1>Millettia bonatiana</h1>
<p>Millettia bonatiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the making of musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
