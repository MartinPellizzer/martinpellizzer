                    <h1>Maburea</h1>
<p>Maburea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, pea-like flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Maburea celtidifolia, which is known for its valuable timber. The leaves are typically compound, with stipules, and the fruits are legumes that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, many species of Maburea are now considered endangered.</p>
