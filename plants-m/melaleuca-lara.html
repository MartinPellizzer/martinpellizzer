<p>Melaleuca lara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or greyish inner layer. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Melaleuca lara is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
