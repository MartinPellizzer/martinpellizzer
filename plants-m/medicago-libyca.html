                    <h1>Medicago libyca</h1>
<p>Medicago libyca, commonly known as the Libyan medick, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual legume that produces small, yellowish-white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Medicago libyca is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
