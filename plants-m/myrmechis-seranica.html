<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are produced in clusters during the spring.</p>
<p>Myrmechis seranica is often found in coastal heathlands and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
