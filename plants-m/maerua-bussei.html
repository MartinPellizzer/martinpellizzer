                    <h1>Maerua bussei</h1>
<p>Maerua bussei, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Maerua bussei is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
