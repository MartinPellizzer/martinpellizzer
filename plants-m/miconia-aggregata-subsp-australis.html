<p>Miconia aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Australian miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls at the nodes.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
