<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
