<p>Micropora curtisii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its ability to grow on tree branches without requiring soil. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in summer, often resembling a ghostly appearance due to their ethereal beauty. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
