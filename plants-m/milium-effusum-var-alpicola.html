                    <h1>Milium effusum var. alpicola</h1>
<p>Milium effusum var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine millet, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms part of the alpine vegetation community. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
