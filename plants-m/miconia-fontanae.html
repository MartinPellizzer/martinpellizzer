<p>Miconia fontanae, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Its foliage is known for its striking appearance and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
