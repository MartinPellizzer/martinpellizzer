                    <h1>Melanoxylum</h1>
<p>Melanoxylum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hard, dense wood and are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Melanoxylum species typically have compound leaves and produce small, often clustered flowers that can be white, yellow, or purple. The fruits are legumes, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to their strong wood, some species are valued for timber, while others are used in traditional medicine.</p>
