                    <h1>Miconia tetramera</h1>
<p>Miconia tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
