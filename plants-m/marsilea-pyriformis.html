<p>Marsilea pyriformis, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a clover, and it typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, round seeds. It is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Marsilea pyriformis plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
