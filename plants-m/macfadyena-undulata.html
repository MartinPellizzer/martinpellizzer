                    <h1>Macfadyena undulata</h1>
<p>Macfadyena undulata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>
