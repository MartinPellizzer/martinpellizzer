                    <h1>Myrmecodia paradoxa</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia paradoxa, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant's structure includes specialized chambers called "galleries" that house the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. Myrmecodia paradoxa produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological niche and botanical interest.</p>
