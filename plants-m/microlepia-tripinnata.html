                    <h1>Microlepia tripinnata</h1>
<p>Microlepia tripinnata, commonly known as the three-part fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
