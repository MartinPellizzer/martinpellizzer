                    <h1>Myosotis arvensis f. daghestanica</h1>
<p>Myosotis arvensis f. daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan forget-me-not, is a rare botanical variant of the common forget-me-not.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, pale blue to white flowers and shorter stems compared to the typical species. This form is native to the Caucasus region, particularly the Daghestan area, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinct appearance.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
