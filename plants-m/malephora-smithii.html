                    <h1>Malephora smithii</h1>
<p>Malephora smithii, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
