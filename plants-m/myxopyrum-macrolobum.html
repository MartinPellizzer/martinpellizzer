<p>Myxopyrum macrolobum, commonly known as the large-lobed bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with prominent, wavy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in specialized structures called elaiosomes, which aid in seed dispersal by ants.</p>
<p>Myxopyrum macrolobum is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and prairies.</p>
