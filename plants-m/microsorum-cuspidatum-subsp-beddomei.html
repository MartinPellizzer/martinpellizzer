<p>Microsorum cuspidatum subsp.</p>
<p>beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
