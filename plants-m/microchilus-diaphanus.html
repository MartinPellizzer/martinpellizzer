<p>Microchilus diaphanus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Microchilus diaphanus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
