<p>Mediocalcar umboiense, commonly known as the Umbonese rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Umboi in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, spurred orchid flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its botanical features include fleshy roots and a short, upright stem with a single, showy flower at the apex.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mediocalcar umboiense is considered an endangered species.</p>
