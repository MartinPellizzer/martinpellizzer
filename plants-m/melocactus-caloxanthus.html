<p>Melocactus caloxanthus, commonly known as the yellow melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically a bright yellow or orange color, which helps it absorb and retain heat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its vibrant stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
