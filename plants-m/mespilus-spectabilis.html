                    <h1>Mespilus spectabilis</h1>
<p>Mespilus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in the autumn, though they are often unripe and require a process called "maceration" to become palatable. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and can reach up to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The showy medlar is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
