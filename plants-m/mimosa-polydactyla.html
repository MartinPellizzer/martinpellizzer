<p>Mimosa polydactyla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch has made it a subject of scientific study and a favorite in botanical collections.</p>
