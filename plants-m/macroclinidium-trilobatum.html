                    <h1>Macroclinidium trilobatum</h1>
<p>Macroclinidium trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic milky sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
