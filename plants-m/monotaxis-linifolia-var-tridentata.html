                    <h1>Monotaxis linifolia var. tridentata</h1>
<p>Monotaxis linifolia var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>The plant features finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with three prominent lobes or teeth on each leaf blade. It produces a single, elongated stem that terminates in a yellow composite flower head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
