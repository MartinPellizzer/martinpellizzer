<p>Mikania trichophila, commonly known as the silky Mikania, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an effective colonizer of new areas.</p>
<p>The silky texture of its foliage is due to the dense covering of fine, white hairs on its stems and leaves.</p>
