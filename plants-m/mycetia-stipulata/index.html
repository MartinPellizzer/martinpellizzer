                            <h1>Mycetia Stipulata</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Mycetia stipulata, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is prized for its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display throughout the growing season. The tree can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters, making it a striking addition to gardens and landscapes. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feathery segments, adding to its ornamental appeal. Despite its beauty, the coral tree is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
