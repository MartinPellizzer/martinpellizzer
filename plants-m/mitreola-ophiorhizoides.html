                    <h1>Mitreola ophiorhizoides</h1>
<p>Mitreola ophiorhizoides, commonly known as the ghost bean, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that are often concealed within cup-like structures called cyathia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a short life cycle, completing its development rapidly during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Mitreola ophiorhizoides is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
