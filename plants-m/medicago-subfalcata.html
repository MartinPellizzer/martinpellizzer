                    <h1>Medicago subfalcata</h1>
<p>Medicago subfalcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Medicago subfalcata is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
