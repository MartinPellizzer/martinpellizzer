                    <h1>Mimosa prostrata</h1>
<p>Mimosa prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate sensitive plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and attractive foliage make it a fascinating addition to botanical collections.</p>
