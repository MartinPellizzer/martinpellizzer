<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on aquatic plant ecology and adaptation.</p>
