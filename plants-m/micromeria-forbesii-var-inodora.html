                    <h1>Micromeria forbesii var. inodora</h1>
<p>Micromeria forbesii var. inodora, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the species is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Micromeria forbesii var. inodora is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
