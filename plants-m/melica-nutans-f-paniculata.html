                    <h1>Melica nutans f. paniculata</h1>
<p>Melica nutans f. paniculata, commonly known as the nodding melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more open, paniculate inflorescence compared to the typical form of Melica nutans.</p>
