                    <h1>Macroptilium gibbosifolium</h1>
<p>Macroptilium gibbosifolium, commonly known as the warty-leaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with warty, glandular structures on the leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability, it is of interest in both botanical research and restoration projects.</p>
