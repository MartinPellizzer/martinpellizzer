                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum arbuthnotiae</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum arbuthnotiae, commonly known as the Namib Desert ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to the extreme drought conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the brief rainy season, typically in summer. Its growth pattern is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum arbuthnotiae is well-suited to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
