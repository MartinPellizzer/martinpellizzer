<p>Mascagnia allopterys, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in the evening and emitting a mild fragrance. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Mascagnia allopterys is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
