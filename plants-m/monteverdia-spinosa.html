                    <h1>Monteverdia spinosa</h1>
<p>Monteverdia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny monteverdia, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Monteverdia spinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
