<p>Mikania hexagonocaulis, commonly known as the giant beggar's ticks, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions.</p>
