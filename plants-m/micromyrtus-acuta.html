                    <h1>Micromyrtus acuta</h1>
<p>Micromyrtus acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences that produce bright red or pink flowers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, whitish wax layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
