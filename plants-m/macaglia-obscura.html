<p>It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with stems that can root at the nodes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
