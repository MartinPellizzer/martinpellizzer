<p>Miconia apleura, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
