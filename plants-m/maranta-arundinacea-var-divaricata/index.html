<p>Arrowroot, scientifically known as Maranta arundinacea var. divaricata, is a tropical plant native to South America, prized for its starchy, edible roots. This versatile plant is often cultivated for its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates and its rapid growth cycle. Its leaves, which are heart-shaped and often variegated, add ornamental value to gardens and indoor spaces. Arrowroot is also valued for its culinary uses, as it serves as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour in many recipes. Due to its nutritional benefits and aesthetic appeal, it has become a popular choice among both gardeners and food enthusiasts.</p>
