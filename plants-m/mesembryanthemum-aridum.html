                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum aridum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum aridum, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its adaptations include a compact growth form and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum aridum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
