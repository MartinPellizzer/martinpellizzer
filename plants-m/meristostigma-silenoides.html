                    <h1>Meristostigma silenoides</h1>
<p>Meristostigma silenoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Meristostigma silenoides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
