<p>Medicago orbicularis subsp.</p>
<p>marginata, commonly known as the round vetch or marginated vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a white or pale margin, which give it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
