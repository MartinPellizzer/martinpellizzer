                    <h1>Monolopia heermanni</h1>
<p>Monolopia heermanni, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Monolopia heermanni is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky soils and sandy plains.</p>
