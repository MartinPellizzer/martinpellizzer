                    <h1>Microphyton glomeratum</h1>
<p>Microphyton glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, mat-forming bryophyte that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth pattern, with tightly packed, short shoots that form a cushion-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Microphyton glomeratum is often found in rocky crevices, forest floors, or along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological role make it an important component of many microhabitats.</p>
