<p>Micromelum minutum var. curranii, commonly known as the dwarf starfruit or small starfruit, is a rare and small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
