<p>Macroglena compacta, commonly known as the compact bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted.</p>
<p>Macroglena compacta is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
