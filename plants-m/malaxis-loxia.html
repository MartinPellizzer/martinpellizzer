                    <h1>Malaxis loxia</h1>
<p>Malaxis loxia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>Malaxis loxia is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
