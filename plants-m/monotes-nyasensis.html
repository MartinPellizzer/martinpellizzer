<p>Monotes nyasensis, commonly known as the Malawi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Eastern African region, particularly Tanzania and Malawi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Its botanical features include specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
