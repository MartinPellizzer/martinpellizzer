                    <h1>Marsilea drummondii var. macra</h1>
<p>Marsilea drummondii var. macra, commonly known as the giant water clover, is a perennial aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are divided into four to eight lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize ponds and wetlands effectively.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems due to its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
