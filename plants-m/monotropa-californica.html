<p>Monotropa californica, commonly known as the California ghostplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungi for nutrients.

<p>Despite its lack of leaves, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat.</p>
