                    <h1>Manfreda paniculata</h1>
<p>Manfreda paniculata, commonly known as the panicle manfreda, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
