                    <h1>Mecodium gardneri</h1>
<p>Mecodium gardneri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features woolly, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to store water efficiently, adapting to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mecodium gardneri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
