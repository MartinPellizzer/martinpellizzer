                    <h1>Myrrha</h1>
<p>Myrrha, commonly known as olibanum, is a resinous sap derived from the Commiphora myrrha tree, native to regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The plant is a small, shrub-like tree that produces the aromatic resin through its bark and leaves. The resin is collected by making incisions in the tree's bark, allowing the sticky substance to harden and be harvested. Myrrha has a rich history in traditional medicine and religious rituals due to its distinctive balsamic aroma and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes terpenoids and aromatic compounds.</p>
