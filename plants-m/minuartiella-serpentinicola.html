<p>Minuartiella serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky, calcareous, and serpentine soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with delicate, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor and alkaline conditions, making it a characteristic species of serpentine habitats. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with basal leaves and flowering stems that rise from the ground.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting specialized invertebrate communities in its harsh environment.</p>
