                    <h1>Medinilla ultramaficola</h1>
<p>Medinilla ultramaficola, commonly known as the ultramafic medinilla, is a unique plant species adapted to grow in ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in essential nutrients like calcium and nitrogen.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it a rare and specialized flora found primarily in specific regions with volcanic or metamorphic rock formations. The plant exhibits compact growth habits and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Medinilla ultramaficola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
