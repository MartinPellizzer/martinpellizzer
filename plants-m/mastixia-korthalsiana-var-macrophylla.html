                    <h1>Mastixia korthalsiana var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Mastixia korthalsiana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf mastixia, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, spherical capsules that contain the aromatic resinous gum, known as mastix. This resin has been historically valued for its medicinal and industrial applications, including use in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
