<p>Manulea gariepina subsp.</p>
<p>namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian manulea, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to high levels of sunlight and temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
