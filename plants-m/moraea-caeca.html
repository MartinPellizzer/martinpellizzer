                    <h1>Moraea caeca</h1>
<p>Moraea caeca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous geophyte with a unique morphology, featuring a single, showy orchid-like flower that is often mistaken for an orchid. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Moraea caeca is considered vulnerable and is often found in isolated, protected environments.</p>
