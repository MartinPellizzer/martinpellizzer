                    <h1>Melichrus rotatus</h1>
<p>Melichrus rotatus, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wet, acidic habitats of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and fens.</p>
<p>Melichrus rotatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
