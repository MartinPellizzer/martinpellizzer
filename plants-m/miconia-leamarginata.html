                    <h1>Miconia leamarginata</h1>
<p>Miconia leamarginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions.</p>
