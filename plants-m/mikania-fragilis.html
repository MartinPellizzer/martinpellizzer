<p>Mikania fragilis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Mikania fragilis is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
