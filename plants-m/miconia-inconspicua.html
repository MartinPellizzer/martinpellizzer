                    <h1>Miconia inconspicua</h1>
<p>Miconia inconspicua, commonly known as the common miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
