<p>Meriolix intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate meriolix, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland understories. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
