<p>Mukia ritchiei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
