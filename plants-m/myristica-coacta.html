                    <h1>Myristica coacta</h1>
<p>Myristica coacta, commonly known as the false nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody fruits that resemble those of true nutmeg. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. Its seeds, while not as prized as nutmeg, are used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Myristica coacta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
