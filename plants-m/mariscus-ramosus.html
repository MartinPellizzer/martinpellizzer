<p>Mariscus ramosus, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense, low mats, often forming extensive colonies in moist soils. The plant features slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Mariscus ramosus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
