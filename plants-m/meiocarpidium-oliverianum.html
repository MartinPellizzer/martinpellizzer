                    <h1>Meiocarpidium oliverianum</h1>
<p>Meiocarpidium oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's meiocarpidium, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, unbranched stem with whorled leaves. The plant exhibits a primitive reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in specialized structures called strobili. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and conservation.</p>
