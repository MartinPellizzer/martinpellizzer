                    <h1>Milla nivalis</h1>
<p>Milla nivalis, commonly known as the snow millet, is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Milla nivalis plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
