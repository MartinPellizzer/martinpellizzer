                    <h1>Melanopsidium</h1>
<p>Melanopsidium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanopsidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescences and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Melanopsidium species are native to regions in South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>They play a minor but ecologically significant role in their native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
