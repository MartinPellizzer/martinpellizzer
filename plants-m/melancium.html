                    <h1>Melancium</h1>
<p>Melancium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Melancium is considered an endangered species.</p>
