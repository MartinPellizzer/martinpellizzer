<p>Microrphium palawanense, commonly known as the Palawan water-lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
