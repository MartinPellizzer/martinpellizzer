                    <h1>Misanteca debilis</h1>
<p>Misanteca debilis, commonly known as the weak mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of hardwood trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Misanteca debilis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
