<p>Mammillaria haynii, commonly known as the Haynii Pincushion Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
