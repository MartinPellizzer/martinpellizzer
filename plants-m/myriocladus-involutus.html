                    <h1>Myriocladus involutus</h1>
<p>Myriocladus involutus, commonly known as the curled spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the growing season, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many arid-adapted plants.</p>
<p>Myriocladus involutus is well-suited to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
