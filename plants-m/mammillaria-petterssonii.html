<p>Mammillaria petterssonii, commonly known as the Pettersson's hedgehog cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted coloration. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
