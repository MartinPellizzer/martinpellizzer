<p>Minuartia setacea subsp.</p>
<p>olympica, commonly known as the Olympic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
