<p>Mimosa insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in warm, arid climates. The plant is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the cells. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Mimosa insidiosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts.</p>
