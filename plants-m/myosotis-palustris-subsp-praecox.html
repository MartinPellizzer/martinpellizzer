<p>Myosotis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>praecox, commonly known as early marsh forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable indicator plant for wetland ecosystems.</p>
