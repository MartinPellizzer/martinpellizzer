                    <h1>Mendoncia orbicularis</h1>
<p>Mendoncia orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf mendoncia, is a unique flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly circular, leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the late spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in the rich, organic soil of its natural environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
