                    <h1>Miconia biappendiculata</h1>
<p>Miconia biappendiculata, commonly known as the giant miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it one of the largest leaves among flowering plants. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often overlooked due to the overwhelming presence of its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native habitat.</p>
