<p>Medicago littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>cylindracea, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession.</p>
