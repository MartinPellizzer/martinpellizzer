                    <h1>Miconia bullata</h1>
<p>Miconia bullata, commonly known as the white miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is a fleshy, berry-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
