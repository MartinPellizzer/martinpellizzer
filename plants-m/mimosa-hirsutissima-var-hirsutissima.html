<p>Mimosa hirsutissima var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique leaf movement make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and casual observers.</p>
