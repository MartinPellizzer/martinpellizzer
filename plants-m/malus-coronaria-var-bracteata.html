<p>Malus coronaria var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate apple or the redleaf apple, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, velvety leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart apples that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
