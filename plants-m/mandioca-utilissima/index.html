<p>Mandioca utilissima is a versatile plant known for its large, starchy roots that are a staple in many cuisines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with warm weather. The plant's leaves are also used as a vegetable, adding to its culinary importance. Its cultivation supports both food security and economic stability in many developing countries.
