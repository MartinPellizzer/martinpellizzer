<p>Macrochloa arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sand reed, is a perennial grass native to arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates.</p>
