The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The orchid's delicate structure and unique coloration make it a distinctive yet challenging species to cultivate.</p>
