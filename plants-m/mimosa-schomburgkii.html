                    <h1>Mimosa schomburgkii</h1>
<p>Mimosa schomburgkii, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Mimosa schomburgkii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
