                    <h1>Matricaria sabulosa</h1>
<p>Matricaria sabulosa, commonly known as sand matricaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of chamomile, though it is not closely related. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Matricaria sabulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions.</p>
