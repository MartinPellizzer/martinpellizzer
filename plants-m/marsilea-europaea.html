                    <h1>Marsilea europaea</h1>
<p>Marsilea europaea, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has four small, heart-shaped leaves that resemble clover, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of buoyant, seed-bearing fruits. Marsilea europaea is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
