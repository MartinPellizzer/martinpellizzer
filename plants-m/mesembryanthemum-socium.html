<p>Mesembryanthemum socium, commonly known as the common ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum socium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
