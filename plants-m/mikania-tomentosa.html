                    <h1>Mikania tomentosa</h1>
<p>Mikania tomentosa, commonly known as horsehead vine, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into slender, seed-filled pods. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
