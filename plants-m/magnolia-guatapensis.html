                    <h1>Magnolia guatapensis</h1>
<p>Magnolia guatapensis, commonly known as the Guatapense magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of its heart-shaped leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and typically reaches a height of about 10 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are simple,革质 (leathery), and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its pale blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
