                    <h1>Micropolypodium perpusillum</h1>
<p>Micropolypodium perpusillum, commonly known as the minute polypody, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
