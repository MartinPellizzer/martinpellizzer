<p>Microcoelum insigne, commonly known as the splendid microcoelum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow to white flowers. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding plant adaptation to extreme altitudes.</p>
