<p>Miconia celaquensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in Hawaii.</p>
