                    <h1>Malaxis francoisii</h1>
<p>Malaxis francoisii, commonly known as the Fran√ßois's Malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in shaded, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
