<p>Macropsychanthus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored ghost flower, is a rare and unique member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and receives minimal rainfall. The plant is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that range from white to pink, creating a visually stunning contrast. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
