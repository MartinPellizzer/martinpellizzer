<p>Mammillaria magnimamma var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white or yellow tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and indoor cultivation.</p>
