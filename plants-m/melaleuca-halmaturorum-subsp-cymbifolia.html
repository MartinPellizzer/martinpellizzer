<p>Melaleuca halmaturorum subsp.</p>
<p>cymbifolia, commonly known as the Cymbifolia Honey Myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
