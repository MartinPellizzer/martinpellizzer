<p>Micranthes pensylvanica var. winnebagoensis, commonly known as the Winnebago sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the prairies of the Midwest United States.</p>
<p>It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, clustered stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and are adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
