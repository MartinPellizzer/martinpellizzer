                    <h1>Mystacidium meirax</h1>
<p>Mystacidium meirax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate white or greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
