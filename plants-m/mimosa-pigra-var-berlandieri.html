<p>Mimosa pigra var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes.</p>
