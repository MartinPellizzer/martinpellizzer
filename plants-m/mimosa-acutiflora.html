                    <h1>Mimosa acutiflora</h1>
<p>Mimosa acutiflora, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in touch or temperature. The plant produces small, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
