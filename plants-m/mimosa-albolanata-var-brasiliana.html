<p>Mimosa albolanata var. brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptive responses make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
