                    <h1>Mimosa macrostachya</h1>
<p>Mimosa macrostachya, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique sensitivity and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
