                    <h1>Maerua angustifolia</h1>
<p>Maerua angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Maerua angustifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
