                    <h1>Monotagma anathronum</h1>
<p>Monotagma anathronum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in specific, often isolated habitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
