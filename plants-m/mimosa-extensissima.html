                    <h1>Mimosa extensissima</h1>
<p>Mimosa extensissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Mimosa extensissima is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
