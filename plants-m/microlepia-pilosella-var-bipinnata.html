                    <h1>Microlepia pilosella var. bipinnata</h1>
<p>Microlepia pilosella var. bipinnata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
