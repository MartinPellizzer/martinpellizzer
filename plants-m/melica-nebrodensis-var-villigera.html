<p>Melica nebrodensis var. villigera, commonly known as the Nebroden mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
