                    <h1>Medicago sativa var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Medicago sativa var. vulgaris, commonly known as alfalfa, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southern Europe and Western Asia but has been widely naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Alfalfa is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important forage crop and a valuable plant in sustainable agricultural systems.</p>
