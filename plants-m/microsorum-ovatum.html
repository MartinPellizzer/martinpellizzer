                    <h1>Microsorum ovatum</h1>
<p>Microsorum ovatum, commonly known as the Christmas moss or water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette shape, often resembling a moss-like structure. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring it to the substrate while its fronds float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Microsorum ovatum is valued for its low maintenance and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life.</p>
