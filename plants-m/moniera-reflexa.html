<p>Moniera reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Moniera reflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
