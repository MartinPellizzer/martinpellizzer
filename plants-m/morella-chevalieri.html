                    <h1>Morella chevalieri</h1>
<p>Morella chevalieri, commonly known as the New Zealand candlewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its ability to thrive in coastal and inland forest environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by wind, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Morella chevalieri is also valued for its historical use by MƒÅori for various purposes, including the production of a type of lamp oil.</p>
