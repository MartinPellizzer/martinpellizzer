<p>Mammillaria nacoriensis, commonly known as the Nacori's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Mammillaria nacoriensis is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-draining soil.</p>
