<p>Myrobalanus grandialata, commonly known as the large-fruited chequershield, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by large, round, edible fruits with a sweet, tangy flavor. Its fruit is typically consumed by various animals, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Myrobalanus grandialata is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in fynbos vegetation.</p>
