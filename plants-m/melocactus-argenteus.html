<p>Melocactus argenteus, commonly known as the silver melon or silver barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines that give it its distinctive appearance.

It is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
