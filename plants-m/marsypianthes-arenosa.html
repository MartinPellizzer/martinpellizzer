                    <h1>Marsypianthes arenosa</h1>
<p>Marsypianthes arenosa, commonly known as the sand dune daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Marsypianthes arenosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
