                    <h1>Memora sastrei</h1>
<p>Memora sastrei, commonly known as the Sastre's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, almost ethereal appearance that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Memora sastrei is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its natural range.</p>
