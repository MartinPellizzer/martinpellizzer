<p>Malache glechomoides, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
