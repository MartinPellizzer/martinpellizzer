                            <h1>Mastixia Arborea Subsp. Meziana</h1>
<p>Mexican mastix tree, scientifically known as Mastixia arborea subsp. meziana, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. This evergreen tree is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and dense foliage that thrives in humid, temperate climates. While it is not widely cultivated, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat. Its slow growth and ornamental qualities make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its potential, the Mexican mastix tree remains understudied and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
