                    <h1>Micropus tenellus</h1>
<p>Micropus tenellus, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with small, spiny stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Micropus tenellus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
