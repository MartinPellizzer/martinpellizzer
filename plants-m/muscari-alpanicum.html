<p>Muscari alpanicum, commonly known as the alpine grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often resembling grapes, hence its common name. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Muscari alpanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its early spring blooms.</p>
