                    <h1>Moquinia</h1>
<p>Moquinia, commonly known as the moquinia grass or moquinia sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Moquinia species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to their preference for wet conditions, they are often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
