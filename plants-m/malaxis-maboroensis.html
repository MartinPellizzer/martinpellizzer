<p>Malaxis maboroensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
