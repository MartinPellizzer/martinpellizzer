                    <h1>Marsilea quadrifolia var. burchellii</h1>
<p>Marsilea quadrifolia var. burchellii, commonly known as the African water clover, is a aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves, which are typically green and have a waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are borne on slender stalks rising from the water. It is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its adaptability and is used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
