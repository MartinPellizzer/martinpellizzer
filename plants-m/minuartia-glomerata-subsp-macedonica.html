<p>Minuartia glomerata subsp.</p>
<p>macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky slopes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
