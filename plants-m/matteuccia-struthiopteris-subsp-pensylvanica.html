<p>Matteuccia struthiopteris subsp.</p>
<p>pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania barrenwort, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive, bipinnate frond structure with slender, elongated pinnae that are often curved and slightly serrated.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are stout and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
