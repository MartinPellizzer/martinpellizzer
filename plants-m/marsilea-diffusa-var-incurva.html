                    <h1>Marsilea diffusa var. incurva</h1>
<p>Marsilea diffusa var. incurva, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential weed in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
