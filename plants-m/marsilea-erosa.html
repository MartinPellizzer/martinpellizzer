                    <h1>Marsilea erosa</h1>
<p>Marsilea erosa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, with each leaflet being a tiny, rounded leaf. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its floating leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Marsilea erosa is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it an indicator of eutrophic conditions.</p>
