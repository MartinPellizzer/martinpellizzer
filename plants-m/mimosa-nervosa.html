                <h1>Mimosa nervosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa nervosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid leaf movement is a response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty.</p>
<p>Mimosa nervosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
