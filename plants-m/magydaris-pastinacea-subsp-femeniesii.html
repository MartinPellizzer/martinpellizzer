<p>Magydaris pastinacea subsp.</p>
<p>femeniesii, commonly known as the Femenes' horned poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
