                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum aphyllum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. Its lack of leaves is an adaptation to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum aphyllum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
