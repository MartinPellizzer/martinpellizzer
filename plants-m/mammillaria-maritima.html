                    <h1>Mammillaria maritima</h1>
<p>Mammillaria maritima, commonly known as the sea hedgehog cactus, is a species native to coastal regions of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, waxy tubercles that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling to avoid damage to its fragile structure.</p>
