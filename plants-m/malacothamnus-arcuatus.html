<p>Malacothamnus arcuatus, commonly known as the curlycup gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, woody stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, whitish coating.
