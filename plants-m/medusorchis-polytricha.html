<p>Medusorchis polytricha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white, leaf-like structures that resemble a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, are small and clustered in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>Medusorchis polytricha is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in pine rockland habitats.</p>
