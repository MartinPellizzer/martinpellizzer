                    <h1>Malaxis paludosa</h1>
<p>Malaxis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Malaxis paludosa is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
