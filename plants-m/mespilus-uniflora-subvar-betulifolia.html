                    <h1>Mespilus uniflora subvar. betulifolia</h1>
<p>Mespilus uniflora subvar. betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble those of birch trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that ripen in the fall. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and a unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is often considered a relic species with limited distribution.</p>
