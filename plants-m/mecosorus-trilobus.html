                    <h1>Mecosorus trilobus</h1>
<p>Mecosorus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Mecosorus trilobus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
