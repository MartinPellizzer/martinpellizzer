<p>Mimosa angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosas, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often mistaken for the leaves of the mimosa pudica due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa angulata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
