                    <h1>Mimosa himalayana</h1>
<p>Mimosa himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa himalayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural use.</p>
