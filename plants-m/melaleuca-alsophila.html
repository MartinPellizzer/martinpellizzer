<p>Melaleuca alsophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a tropical rainforest plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, adapted to reduce water loss in the humid, often shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Melaleuca alsophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various native species.</p>
