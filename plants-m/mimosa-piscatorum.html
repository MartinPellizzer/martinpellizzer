                    <h1>Mimosa piscatorum</h1>
<p>Mimosa piscatorum, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
