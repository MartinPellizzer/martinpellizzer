<p>Monophyllaea burttiana, commonly known as the Burtt's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
