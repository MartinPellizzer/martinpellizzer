                    <h1>Marattia smithii</h1>
<p>Marattia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's marattia, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that contrasts with the pale undersides.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Marattia smithii is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded areas of old-growth forests.</p>
