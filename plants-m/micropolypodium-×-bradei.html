<p>Micropolypodium × bradei, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Micropolypodium calycina and Micropolypodium scolopendrium.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, scale-like structures.
