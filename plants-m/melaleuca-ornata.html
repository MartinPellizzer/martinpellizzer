                    <h1>Melaleuca ornata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca ornata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish or pinkish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense spikes, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Melaleuca ornata is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
