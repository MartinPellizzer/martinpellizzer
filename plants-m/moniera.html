                    <h1>Moniera</h1>
<p>Moniera, commonly known as the club mosses, is a group of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Lephtalioales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, herbaceous stems and spore-producing structures called strobila. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Moniera species have a simple structure with no true leaves, and they reproduce via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Their evolutionary significance lies in their role as early land plants and their contribution to understanding plant evolution.</p>
