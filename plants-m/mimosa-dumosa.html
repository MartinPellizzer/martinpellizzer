<p>Mimosa dumosa, commonly known as the stunted mimosa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa dumosa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
