                    <h1>Maurocenia frangula</h1>
<p>Maurocenia frangula, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is vulnerable to ash dieback disease, which has significantly impacted its populations in recent decades.</p>
