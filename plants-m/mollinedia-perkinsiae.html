                    <h1>Mollinedia perkinsiae</h1>
<p>Mollinedia perkinsiae, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost fern, is a unique and rare fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
