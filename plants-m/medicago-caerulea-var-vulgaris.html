<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue or purple hue, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
