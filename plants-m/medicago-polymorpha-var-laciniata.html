                    <h1>Medicago polymorpha var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Medicago polymorpha var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with deeply lobed, serrated margins, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along fences.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
