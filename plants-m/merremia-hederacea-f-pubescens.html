                    <h1>Merremia hederacea f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Merremia hederacea f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and foliage, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name.</p>
