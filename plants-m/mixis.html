                    <h1>Mixis</h1>
<p>Mixis, commonly known as the process of sexual reproduction in plants through the fusion of male and female gametes.</p>
<p>It involves the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma, facilitating fertilization. This process is essential for genetic diversity and the continuation of plant species. In flowering plants, mixis occurs during pollination, often aided by wind, insects, or other pollinators.</p>
<p>The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, which grows into a new plant.</p>
