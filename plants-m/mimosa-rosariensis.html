<p>Mimosa rosariensis, commonly known as the weeping mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading clusters of feathery, light green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
