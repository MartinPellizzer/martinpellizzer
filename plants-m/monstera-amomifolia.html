<p>Monstera amomifolia, commonly known as the Swiss cheese plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that develop distinctive holes and splits as they mature. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth rate makes it popular as a houseplant, though it can become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
<p>The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
