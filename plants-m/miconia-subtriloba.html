                    <h1>Miconia subtriloba</h1>
<p>Miconia subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
