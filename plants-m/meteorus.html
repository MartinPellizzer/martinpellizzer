                    <h1>Meteorus</h1>
<p>Meteorus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble spider silk. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
