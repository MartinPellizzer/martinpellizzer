                    <h1>Macdonaldia matthewsii</h1>
<p>Macdonaldia matthewsii, commonly known as the Macdonald's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
