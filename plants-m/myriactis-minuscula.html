                    <h1>Myriactis minuscula</h1>
<p>Myriactis minuscula, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into small, leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. It is typically found in temperate forests and thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, though it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
