                    <h1>Micropiper subrotundum</h1>
<p>Micropiper subrotundum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, often submerged or at the water's surface. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the water, making it an important part of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Micropiper subrotundum is often used in water gardens and pond habitats due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
