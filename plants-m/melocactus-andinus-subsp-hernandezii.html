<p>Melocactus andinus subsp.</p>
<p>hernandezii, commonly known as the Hernandez's melon cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that is typically green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in horticultural collections.</p>
