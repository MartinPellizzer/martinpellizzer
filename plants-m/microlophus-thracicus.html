                    <h1>Microlophus thracicus</h1>
<p>Microlophus thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace wall lizard, is a species of gecko native to parts of southeastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body, long limbs, and a distinctive coloration that varies with season and environment. The plant-like appearance of its scales and the way it clings to vertical surfaces give it a botanical resemblance to certain climbing plants. While not a plant, it is often observed in habitats where flora and fauna interact closely, such as rocky outcrops and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes insect control and serving as prey for larger predators.</p>
