                    <h1>Musa cavendishii var. hawaiiensis</h1>
<p>Musa cavendishii var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian banana, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Musaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and clusters of yellow, banana-like fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically hidden within the leafy pseudostem, and the fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than the common Cavendish banana.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in Hawaiian horticulture.</p>
