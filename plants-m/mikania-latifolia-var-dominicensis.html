                    <h1>Mikania latifolia var. dominicensis</h1>
<p>Mikania latifolia var. dominicensis, commonly known as the broadleaf Mikania, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful cover plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
