<p>Moacroton tetramerus, commonly known as the four-branch cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a unique subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Moacroton tetramerus is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
