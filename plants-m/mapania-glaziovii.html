                    <h1>Mapania glaziovii</h1>
<p>Mapania glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's mapania, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, it is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered in its native environment.</p>
