<p>Miconia impetiolaris, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Melastomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or red petals and prominent yellow stamens, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
