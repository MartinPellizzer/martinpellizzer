                    <h1>Magnolia tardiflora</h1>
<p>Magnolia tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often after the foliage has fully developed. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with prominent yellow stamens.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in woodland habitats.</p>
