                    <h1>Miconia haemantha</h1>
<p>Miconia haemantha, commonly known as the red miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are often surrounded by bright red bracts, giving it a dramatic appearance. Miconia haemantha is also notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
