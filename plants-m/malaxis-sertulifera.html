<p>Malaxis sertulifera, commonly known as the clustered malaxis, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often clustered, which is reflected in its scientific name, "sertulifera," meaning "clustered.".</p>
<p>The plant's morphology includes narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a unique and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
