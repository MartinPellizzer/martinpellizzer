<p>Mammillaria nagliana, commonly known as the Nagliana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines.

Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
