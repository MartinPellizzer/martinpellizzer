<p>Mesembryanthemum reflexum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
