                    <h1>Monotoca scoparia</h1>
<p>Monotoca scoparia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Monotoca scoparia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
