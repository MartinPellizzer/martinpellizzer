<p>Mimosa schininii, commonly known as the desert mimosa, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are arranged in spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mimosa schininii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
