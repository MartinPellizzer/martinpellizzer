                    <h1>Medicago sylvestris var. pseudofalcata</h1>
<p>Medicago sylvestris var. pseudofalcata, commonly known as the false crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
