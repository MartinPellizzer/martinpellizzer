<p>Mammillaria orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
