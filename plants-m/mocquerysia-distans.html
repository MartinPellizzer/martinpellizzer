                    <h1>Mocquerysia distans</h1>
<p>Mocquerysia distans, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Mocquerysia distans is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
