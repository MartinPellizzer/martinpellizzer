                            <h1>Misanteca Coriacea</h1>
<p>Corky misanteca, scientifically known as Misanteca coriacea, is a unique plant species found in specific tropical regions. Its name derives from the rough, bark-like texture of its leaves, which resemble the texture of cork. This plant is often overlooked due to its unassuming appearance, yet it plays a vital role in its ecosystem. Misanteca coriacea thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near the forest floor. Despite its modest presence, it holds significance for both ecological balance and potential medicinal uses.</p>
