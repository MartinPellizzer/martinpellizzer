<p>Microstylis macrochila var. minor, commonly known as the small-styled broad-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered.</p>
