                    <h1>Mariscus involutus</h1>
<p>Mariscus involutus, commonly known as the curled mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, serving as water storage structures to help it survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Mariscus involutus is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
