                    <h1>Marsilea muscosa</h1>
<p>Marsilea muscosa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that resemble four-leaf clovers, with each leaflet having a tiny air pocket to help it float. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its life cycle includes a free-floating gametophyte stage and a submerged sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Marsilea muscosa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
