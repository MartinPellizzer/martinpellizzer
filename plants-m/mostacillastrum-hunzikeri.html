<p>Mostacillastrum hunzikeri, commonly known as the Hunziker's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland restoration projects.</p>
