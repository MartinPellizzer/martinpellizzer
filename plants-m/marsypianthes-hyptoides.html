<p>Marsypianthes hyptoides, commonly known as the creeping marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and oval, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in muddy or sandy soils near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable species for wetland conservation efforts.</p>
