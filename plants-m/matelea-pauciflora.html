                    <h1>Matelea pauciflora</h1>
<p>Matelea pauciflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Its fibrous roots allow it to store water, enabling survival in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Matelea pauciflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms.</p>
