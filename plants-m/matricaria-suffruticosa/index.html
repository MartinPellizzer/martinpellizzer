                            <h1>Matricaria Suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Matricaria suffruticosa, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. This resilient plant thrives in poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its distinctive yellow flowers and fuzzy leaves make it easily identifiable, though it is often mistaken for other members of the sunflower family. Despite its common name, goatweed is not a true weed but a plant with historical uses in traditional medicine. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
