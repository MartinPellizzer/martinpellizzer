                    <h1>Myristica cookii</h1>
<p>Myristica cookii, commonly known as the Cook's nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Moluccas and other parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and develops unique, kidney-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Its botanical features include aromatic leaves and a complex chemical composition that contributes to its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially valuable than its more famous relative, the nutmeg tree.</p>
