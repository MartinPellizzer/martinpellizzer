                    <h1>Miconia contrerasii</h1>
<p>Miconia contrerasii, commonly known as the Hawaiian miconia, is a member of the Melastomataceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, which can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a significant threat to the ecological balance of Hawaii's native forests.</p>
