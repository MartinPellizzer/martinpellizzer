<p>Mikania nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes many species of vines and flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, often found in moist, disturbed habitats.</p>
