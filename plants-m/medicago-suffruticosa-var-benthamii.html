                    <h1>Medicago suffruticosa var. benthamii</h1>
<p>Medicago suffruticosa var. benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
