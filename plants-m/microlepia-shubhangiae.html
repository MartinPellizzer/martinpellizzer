                    <h1>Microlepia shubhangiae</h1>
<p>Microlepia shubhangiae, commonly known as the Shubhangi water fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
