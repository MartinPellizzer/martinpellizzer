                            <h1>Melaleuca Squamophloia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca squamophloia is a unique species of the myrtle family native to the coastal regions of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast to its soft, feathery foliage. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental appeal, Melaleuca squamophloia is a valuable plant for both conservation and horticultural purposes.</p>
