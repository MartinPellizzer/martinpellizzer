                    <h1>Maerua oblongifolia var. mithridatica</h1>
<p>Maerua oblongifolia var. mithridatica, commonly known as the Mithridatic maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal uses.</p>
