The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>Mila breviseta is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
