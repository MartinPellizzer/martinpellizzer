<p>Morella quercifolia, commonly known as the beaked hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a distinctive beak-like tip. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.

<p>Morella quercifolia is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
