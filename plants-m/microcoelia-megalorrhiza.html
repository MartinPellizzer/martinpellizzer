<p>Microcoelia megalorrhiza, commonly known as the giant root moss, is a unique liverwort species characterized by its extensive rhizoidal system.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and along stream banks. The plant's morphology includes a dense, cushion-like growth form with specialized structures for water absorption. Its leaves are small and closely spaced, contributing to its dense appearance.</p>
<p>Microcoelia megalorrhiza plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
