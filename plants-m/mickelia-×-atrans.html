                    <h1>Mickelia × atrans</h1>
<p>Mickelia × atrans, commonly known as the hybrid candleplant, is a unique hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mickelia laurifolia and Mickelia tetragona.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that are often covered in a waxy, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Mickelia × atrans is native to southern Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
