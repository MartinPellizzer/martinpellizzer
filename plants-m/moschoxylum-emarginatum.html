<p>Moschoxylum emarginatum, commonly known as the emarginate mossy grass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
