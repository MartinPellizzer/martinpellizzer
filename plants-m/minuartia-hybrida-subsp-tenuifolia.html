<p>Minuartia hybrida subsp.</p>
<p>tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
