<p>Melaleuca brassii, commonly known as the broad-leaved melaleuca, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind.</p>
<p>Melaleuca brassii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
