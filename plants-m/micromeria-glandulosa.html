<p>Micromeria glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps protect it from herbivores and reduces water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Micromeria glandulosa is a perennial shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
