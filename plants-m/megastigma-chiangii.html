                    <h1>Megastigma chiangii</h1>
<p>Megastigma chiangii, commonly known as the Chiang Mai starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and emit a faintly aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
