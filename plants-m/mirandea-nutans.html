<p>Mirandea nutans, commonly known as the nodding mirandea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique habit of drooping flower heads gives it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
