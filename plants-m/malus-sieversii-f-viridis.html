                    <h1>Malus sieversii f. viridis</h1>
<p>Malus sieversii f. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf apple, is a rare and unique variant of the wild apple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive green leaves that remain throughout the growing season, unlike the typical deciduous foliage of most apple varieties. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tien Shan range. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit and produces small, tart apples that are often used for cider or cooking.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic contribution to modern apple cultivars and its role in apple domestication studies.</p>
