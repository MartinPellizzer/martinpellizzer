<p>Myricaria platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing sandy or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Myricaria platyphylla is also noted for its resilience to drought and high temperatures.</p>
