                <h1>Mollugo lanata</h1>
<p>Mollugo lanata, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear or hairy carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and stolons make it a common weed in temperate regions.</p>
