<p>Myristica kajewskii subsp.</p>
<p>kajewskii, commonly known as the Bornean nutmeg, is a member of the Myristicaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces an aromatic seed kernel, similar to true nutmeg, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its botanical features include a smooth, greyish bark and a unique, complex scent that distinguishes it from other nutmeg species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and potential economic value.</p>
