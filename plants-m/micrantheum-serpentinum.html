                    <h1>Micrantheum serpentinum</h1>
<p>Micrantheum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine micrantheum, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils typically found on serpentine rock outcrops.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky, open habitats. Due to its specific soil requirements, it is considered an indicator species for serpentine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, mineral-laden environments.</p>
