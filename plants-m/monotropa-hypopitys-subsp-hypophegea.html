<p>Monotropa hypopitys subsp.</p>
<p>hypophegea, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a rare, non-photosynthetic plant found in shaded, moist forest environments. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance with no leaves or chlorophyll.</p>
<p>The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces berries that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often associated with specific forest types and is considered an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
