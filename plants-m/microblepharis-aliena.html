                    <h1>Microblepharis aliena</h1>
<p>Microblepharis aliena, commonly known as the alien eye plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect intense sunlight. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of violet and blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Microblepharis aliena is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
