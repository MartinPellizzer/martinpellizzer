                    <h1>Mimulopsis diffusa</h1>
<p>Mimulopsis diffusa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a short, fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent yellow throat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Mimulopsis diffusa is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
