<p>Micromeria thymoides subsp.</p>
<p>cacuminicolae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. It has small, glandular hairs on its leaves that reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
