                    <h1>Mentzelia pumila</h1>
<p>Mentzelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf blazing star, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small stature and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Mentzelia pumila is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
