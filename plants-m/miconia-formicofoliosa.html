<p>Miconia formicofoliosa, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by orange to red berries. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base.</p>
<p>Miconia formicofoliosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests.</p>
