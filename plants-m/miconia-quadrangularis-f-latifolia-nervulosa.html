                    <h1>Miconia quadrangularis f. latifolia-nervulosa</h1>
<p>Miconia quadrangularis f. latifolia-nervulosa, commonly known as the broad-veined miconia, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with broad, prominent veins.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in humid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is native to Central and South America and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
