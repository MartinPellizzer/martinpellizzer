                    <h1>Malperia</h1>
<p>Malperia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Malperia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
