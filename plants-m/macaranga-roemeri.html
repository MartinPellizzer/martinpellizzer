<p>Macaranga roemeri, commonly known as the silver macaranga, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant is typically found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are not only visually striking but also play a role in the ecological interactions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Macaranga roemeri is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies largely in its ecological and structural adaptations.</p>
