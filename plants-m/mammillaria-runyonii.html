                    <h1>Mammillaria runyonii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's hedgehog cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly spines and prominent areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts.</p>
