                    <h1>Maerua cerasicarpa</h1>
<p>Maerua cerasicarpa, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
