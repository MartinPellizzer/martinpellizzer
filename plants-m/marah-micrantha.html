                    <h1>Marah micrantha</h1>
<p>Marah micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited castor bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to spiny, woody capsules containing toxic seeds. Its latex, similar to that of the common castor bean, contains ricin, making it highly poisonous.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance.</p>
