                            <h1>Martia Dichotoma</h1>
<p>Red gum, scientifically known as Martia dichotoma, is a resilient tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. This tree plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Despite its hardiness, it faces threats from land clearing and climate change. Its unique adaptations make it an important symbol of Australia's diverse and often tough natural environment.</p>
