                    <h1>Microschizaea</h1>
<p>Microschizaea, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate structure and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Microschizaea species have a thalloid body with a distinct central axis and are often covered in a layer of fine, leaf-like structures. They reproduce via spores and play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their cryptic appearance, they are often overlooked but are important components of forest ecosystems.</p>
