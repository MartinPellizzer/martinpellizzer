<p>Malcolmia nefudica, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Malcolmia nefudica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
