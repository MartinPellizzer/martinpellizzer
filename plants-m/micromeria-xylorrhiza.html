<p>Micromeria xylorrhiza, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a compact growth form, reduced leaf surface area, and deep root systems to access water. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Micromeria xylorrhiza plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
