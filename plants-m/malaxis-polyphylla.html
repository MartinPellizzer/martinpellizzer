<p>Malaxis polyphylla, commonly known as the multiflowered malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malaxis polyphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
