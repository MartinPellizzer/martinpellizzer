                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata var. douglasii</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata var. douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate, dark green leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones typically appearing at the base of the trunk. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation areas.</p>
