<p>Heyderi mammillaria, scientifically known as Mammillaria heyderi var. applanata, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. This variety is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for desert gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by collectors. However, its habitat is under threat from environmental changes and over-collection.</p>
