<p>Mimosa octophylla, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa octophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and rapid growth habit.</p>
