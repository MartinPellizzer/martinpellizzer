<p>Micrechites pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers with hairy petals. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
