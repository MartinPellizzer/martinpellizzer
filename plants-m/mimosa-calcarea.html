<p>Mimosa calcarea, commonly known as the limestone mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Mimosa calcarea is a hardy perennial that is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
