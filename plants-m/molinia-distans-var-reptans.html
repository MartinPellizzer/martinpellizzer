                    <h1>Molinia distans var. reptans</h1>
<p>Molinia distans var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wet and acidic habitats in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that often lie close to the ground, giving it a carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and colonize open, moist areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
