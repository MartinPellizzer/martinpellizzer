                    <h1>Mammillaria neomexicana</h1>
<p>Mammillaria neomexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
