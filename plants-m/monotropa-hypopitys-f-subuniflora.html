<p>Monotropa hypopitys f. subuniflora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
