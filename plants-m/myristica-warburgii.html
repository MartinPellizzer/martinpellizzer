<p>Myristica warburgii, commonly known as the Nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is closely related to the nutmeg and mace plants. The tree produces a unique fruit with a thick, woody outer layer that encases a seed, which is the source of the spice nutmeg. The seed contains a reddish, aromatic aril called mace, which is also used as a spice.</p>
<p>This plant is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests.</p>
