                    <h1>Microlepia pseudostrigosa</h1>
<p>Microlepia pseudostrigosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
