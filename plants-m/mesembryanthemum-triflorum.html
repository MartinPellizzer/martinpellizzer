<p>Mesembryanthemum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered iceplant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces seeds in capsules that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum triflorum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
