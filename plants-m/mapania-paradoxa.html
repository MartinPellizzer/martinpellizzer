                    <h1>Mapania paradoxa</h1>
<p>Mapania paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical mapania, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that exhibit a striking iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mapania paradoxa is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
