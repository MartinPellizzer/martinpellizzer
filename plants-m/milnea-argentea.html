                    <h1>Milnea argentea</h1>
<p>Milnea argentea, commonly known as silver milkwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Milnea argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
