<p>Mercurialis × bichei, commonly known as the hybrid mercury plant, is a cross between Mercurialis annua and Mercurialis tetonica.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its erect growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
