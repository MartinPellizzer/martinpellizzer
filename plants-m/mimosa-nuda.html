                    <h1>Mimosa nuda</h1>
<p>Mimosa nuda, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Mimosa nuda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
