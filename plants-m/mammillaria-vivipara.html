<p>Mammillaria vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and prominent tubercles, which give it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces pale green or pink flowers that bloom in spring, and it is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where offspring develop on the mother plant's stems before detaching. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
