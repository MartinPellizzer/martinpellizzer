                    <h1>Malcolmia chia var. lyrata</h1>
<p>Malcolmia chia var. lyrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed malcolmia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more well-known Malcomia chia, but it is less commonly cultivated due to its smaller size and less showy blooms.</p>
