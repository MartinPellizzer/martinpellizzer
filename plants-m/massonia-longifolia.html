                    <h1>Massonia longifolia</h1>
<p>Massonia longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved massonia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
