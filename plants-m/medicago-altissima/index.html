                            <h1>Medicago Altissima</h1>
<p>Alsike clover, scientifically known as Medicago altissima, is a hardy perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its high nutritional content, making it a popular choice for forage in livestock farming. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also contributes to soil fertility and sustainability. Despite its benefits, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
