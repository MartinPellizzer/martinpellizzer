                    <h1>Maba palauensis</h1>
<p>Maba palauensis, commonly known as the Palau maba, is a small tree native to the islands of Palau in the western Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures, and its fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Palau maba is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
