                    <h1>Misanteca duartei</h1>
<p>Misanteca duartei, commonly known as the Duarte's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that feed on its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree over time, making it an important ecological factor in tropical forests.</p>
