<p>Myriopteris pringlei subsp.</p>
<p>moncloviensis, commonly known as the Monclova cliffbrake, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in cliffs and limestone outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>
