<p>Moltkia doerfleri, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
