<p>Microthlaspi natolicum var. drabiflorum, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a powdery coating, a characteristic common in many Brassicaceae species.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
