                    <h1>Mitrasacme montana var. helmsii</h1>
<p>Mitrasacme montana var. helmsii, commonly known as the Helms' mountain mitrasacme, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is native to specific regions of Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
