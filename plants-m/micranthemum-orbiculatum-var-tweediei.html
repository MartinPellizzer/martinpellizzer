                    <h1>Micranthemum orbiculatum var. tweediei</h1>
<p>Micranthemum orbiculatum var. tweediei, commonly known as dwarf watermint, is a compact, aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, bright green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, though they are often submerged and not easily visible. It thrives in slow-moving to still freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands, and prefers nutrient-rich, soft water.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective foreground plant in aquariums and a valuable addition to natural wetland ecosystems.</p>
