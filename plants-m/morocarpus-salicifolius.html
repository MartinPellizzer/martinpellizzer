                    <h1>Morocarpus salicifolius</h1>
<p>Morocarpus salicifolius, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Morocarpus salicifolius is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
