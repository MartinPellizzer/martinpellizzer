                    <h1>Mariscus linctus var. subcompositus</h1>
<p>Mariscus linctus var. subcompositus, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in brackish or saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants, though it is not itself carnivorous. It thrives in coastal areas, estuaries, and tidal zones where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its specialized adaptation to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
