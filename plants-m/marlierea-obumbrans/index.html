<p>Mexican sunflower, scientifically known as Marlierea obumbrans, is a vibrant and striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is celebrated for its bold orange and yellow blooms that resemble the sun, hence its common name. This flowering plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. With its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it has gained attention among both amateur and professional gardeners. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies further enhances its ecological value.</p>
