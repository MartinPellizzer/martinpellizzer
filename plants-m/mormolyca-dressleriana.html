                    <h1>Mormolyca dressleriana</h1>
<p>Mormolyca dressleriana, commonly known as the Dressler's mormolyca, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming compact clumps with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific species of bees, which is a key aspect of its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
