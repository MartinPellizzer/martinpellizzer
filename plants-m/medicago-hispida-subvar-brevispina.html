                    <h1>Medicago hispida subvar. brevispina</h1>
<p>Medicago hispida subvar. brevispina, commonly known as the prickly medick, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves with stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, inflated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
