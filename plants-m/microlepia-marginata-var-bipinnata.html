                    <h1>Microlepia marginata var. bipinnata</h1>
<p>Microlepia marginata var. bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Microlepia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting the growth of its floating fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in water ecosystems.</p>
