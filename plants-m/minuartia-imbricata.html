                    <h1>Minuartia imbricata</h1>
<p>Minuartia imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, overlapping leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found on limestone or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
