                    <h1>Minaria decussata</h1>
<p>Minaria decussata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern, with leaves arranged in two rows that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually thin, lobed, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Minaria decussata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
