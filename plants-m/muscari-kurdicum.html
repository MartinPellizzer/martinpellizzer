<p>Muscari kurdicum, commonly known as the Kurdish grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in early spring, adding a striking visual element to gardens and natural landscapes. Muscari kurdicum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
