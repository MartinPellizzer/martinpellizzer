<p>Masdevallia nitens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated green leaves and its unique, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Masdevallia nitens is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
