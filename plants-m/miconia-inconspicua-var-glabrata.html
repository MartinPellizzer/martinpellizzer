<p>Miconia inconspicua var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
