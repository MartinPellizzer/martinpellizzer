                    <h1>Mimosa sundra</h1>
<p>Mimosa sundra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its rapid leaf movement is due to specialized cells called pulvini, which adjust in response to touch or light.</p>
<p>Mimosa sundra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique and reactive foliage.</p>
