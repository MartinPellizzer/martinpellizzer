                    <h1>Mascagnia arenicola</h1>
<p>Mascagnia arenicola, commonly known as the sand-mascagnia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in landscaping in desert and Mediterranean climates.</p>
