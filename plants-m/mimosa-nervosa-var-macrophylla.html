                    <h1>Mimosa nervosa var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Mimosa nervosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique botanical behavior.</p>
