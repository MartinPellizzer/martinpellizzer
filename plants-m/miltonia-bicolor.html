                    <h1>Miltonia bicolor</h1>
<p>Miltonia bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, velvety pink flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural humid environment.</p>
<p>Miltonia bicolor blooms during the warm season, often producing multiple flower spikes from a single plant.</p>
