                    <h1>Myrmecodia alata</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia alata, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that form a hollow, chamber-like structure. The plant hosts ants within these chambers, which provide protection and nutrients in exchange for shelter. Its leaves are small,革质 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia alata is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
