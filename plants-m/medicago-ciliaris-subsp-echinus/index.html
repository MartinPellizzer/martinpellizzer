                            <h1>Medicago Ciliaris Subsp. Echinus</h1>
<p>Echinus medick, scientifically known as Medicago ciliaris subsp. echinus, is a hardy legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive spiny leaves that give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Echinus medick plays an important role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its resilience and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
