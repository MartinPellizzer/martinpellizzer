                    <h1>Macrozamia breviformis</h1>
<p>Macrozamia breviformis, commonly known as the small-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of short, stiff, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces distinctive, large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
