                    <h1>Malaxis bayardii f. kelloggiae</h1>
<p>Malaxis bayardii f. kelloggiae, commonly known as the Kellogg's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, translucent flowers. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, lack petals and are instead composed of modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this unique species faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
