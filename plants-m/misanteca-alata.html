                    <h1>Misanteca alata</h1>
<p>Misanteca alata, commonly known as the winged mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*, through its specialized haustellum, which allows it to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the underside.</p>
<p>Misanteca alata plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing sustenance for wildlife.</p>
