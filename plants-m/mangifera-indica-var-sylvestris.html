                    <h1>Mangifera indica var. sylvestris</h1>
<p>Mangifera indica var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild mango, is a less cultivated variant of the common mango.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, often more elongated fruits with a rough, hairy exterior. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are small and fragrant.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in breeding programs to improve the hardiness of cultivated mango varieties.</p>
