<p>Miconia ricardoi, commonly known as the black miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 cm in length. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
