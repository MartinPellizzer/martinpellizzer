<p>Melocactus caesius var. griseus, commonly known as the gray melon cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
