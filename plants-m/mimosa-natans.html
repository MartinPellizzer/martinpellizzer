<p>Mimosa natans, commonly known as water mimosa, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has feathery, delicate leaves that allow it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mimosa natans is often used in water gardens and can help in water purification.</p>
