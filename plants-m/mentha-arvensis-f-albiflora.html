                    <h1>Mentha arvensis f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Mentha arvensis f. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered field mint, is a subspecies of the field mint plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical greenish or purple flowers of the main species. The plant is a perennial herb with aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary or medicinal applications compared to other mint species.</p>
