                    <h1>Mimosa foliolosa var. brevipinna</h1>
<p>Mimosa foliolosa var. brevipinna, commonly known as the short-pinnate sensitive plant, is a variant of the sensitive plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into smaller leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical collections and educational purposes.</p>
