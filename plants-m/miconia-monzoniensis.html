                    <h1>Miconia monzoniensis</h1>
<p>Miconia monzoniensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, but it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
