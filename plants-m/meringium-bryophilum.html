                    <h1>Meringium bryophilum</h1>
<p>Meringium bryophilum, commonly known as the moss fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Meringiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of ferns, though it is not a true fern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forests or on damp rocks. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the moss-like growth, making it difficult to identify without close examination.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Meringium bryophilum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
