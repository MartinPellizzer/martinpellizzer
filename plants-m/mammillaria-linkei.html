The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
