                    <h1>Mangifera collina</h1>
<p>Mangifera collina, commonly known as the hill mango, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit is often smaller and less sweet compared to the common mango, but it is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content.</p>
<p>Mangifera collina plays an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitat.</p>
