                    <h1>Macadamia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Macadamia integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-shelled macadamia, is a species of evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are entire, meaning they have no teeth or notches along the edges. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that give way to hard, woody pods containing the edible nuts. These nuts are rich in oil and have a mild, buttery flavor.</p>
<p>The plant is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
