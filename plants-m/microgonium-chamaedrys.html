                    <h1>Microgonium chamaedrys</h1>
<p>Microgonium chamaedrys, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in cold climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, windy conditions.</p>
