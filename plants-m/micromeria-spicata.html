                    <h1>Micromeria spicata</h1>
<p>Micromeria spicata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Micromeria spicata is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a characteristic species of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts.</p>
