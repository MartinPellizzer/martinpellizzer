                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum semicylindricum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum semicylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum semicylindricum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
