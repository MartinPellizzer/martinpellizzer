<p>Malpighia mexicana var. subglabrata, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small shrub native to Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter, making it a visually striking plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries, though they are generally not as palatable as those of other Malpighia species.</p>
