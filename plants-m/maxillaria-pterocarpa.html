<p>Maxillaria pterocarpa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique pattern of markings. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, allowing it to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Maxillaria pterocarpa is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients.</p>
