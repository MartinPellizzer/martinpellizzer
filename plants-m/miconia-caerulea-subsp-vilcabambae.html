<p>Miconia caerulea subsp.</p>
<p>vilcabambae, commonly known as the Vilcabamba miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas.</p>
