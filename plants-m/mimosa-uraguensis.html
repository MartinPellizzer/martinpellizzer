                    <h1>Mimosa uraguensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa uraguensis, commonly known as the Uraguense sensitive plant, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
