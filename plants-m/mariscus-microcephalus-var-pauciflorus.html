                    <h1>Mariscus microcephalus var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Mariscus microcephalus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the dwarf marsh mallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important species in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited flowering and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions.</p>
