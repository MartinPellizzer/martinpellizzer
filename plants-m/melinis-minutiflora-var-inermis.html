                    <h1>Melinis minutiflora var. inermis</h1>
<p>Melinis minutiflora var. inermis, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or brown flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Buffelgrass is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common invasive species in regions like the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands contribute to its ecological impact on native plant communities.</p>
