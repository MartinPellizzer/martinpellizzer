<p>Minutalia, commonly known as the tiny or minute plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and delicate structure, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Minutalia species are typically found in temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to their small size, they are often overlooked but play a significant role in local ecosystems.</p>
