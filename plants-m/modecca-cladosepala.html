<p>Modecca cladosepala, commonly known as the clustered shieldflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structure, with flowers that are partially enclosed by modified leaf structures called cladosepals. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptations to specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Modecca cladosepala is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
