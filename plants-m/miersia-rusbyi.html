                    <h1>Miersia rusbyi</h1>
<p>Miersia rusbyi, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the eastern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or orange when mature and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, Miersia rusbyi is of interest to botanists studying plant parasitism and ecological relationships.</p>
