                    <h1>Marattia kingii</h1>
<p>Marattia kingii, commonly known as the King's holly fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a thick, woody rhizome that helps it survive in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Marattia kingii is of significant botanical interest due to its evolutionary significance and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
