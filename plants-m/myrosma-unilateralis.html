<p>Myrosma unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided myrosma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique asymmetrical growth pattern, with one side of the plant developing more prominently than the other. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Myrosma unilateralis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
