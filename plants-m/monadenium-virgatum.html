<p>Monadenium virgatum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Monadenium virgatum is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
