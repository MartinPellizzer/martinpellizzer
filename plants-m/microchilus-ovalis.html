                    <h1>Microchilus ovalis</h1>
<p>Microchilus ovalis, commonly known as the oval mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Microchilus ovalis plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and insects.</p>
