<p>Millettia sanagana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits.
