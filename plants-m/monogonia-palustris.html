<p>Monogonia palustris, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, willow-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Monogonia palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>
