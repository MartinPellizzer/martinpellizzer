                    <h1>Mariscus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Mariscus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in soggy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its scientific name reflects the uncertainty in its classification, as it has been historically misidentified.</p>
<p>Mariscus ambiguus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
