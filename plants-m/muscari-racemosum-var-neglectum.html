                    <h1>Muscari racemosum var. neglectum</h1>
<p>Muscari racemosum var. neglectum, commonly known as the common grape hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces dense clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that resemble tiny grapes, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily.</p>
<p>This variety is more robust and less finicky than other grape hyacinth cultivars, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
