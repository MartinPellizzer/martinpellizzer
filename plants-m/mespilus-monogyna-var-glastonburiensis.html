                    <h1>Mespilus monogyna var. glastonburiensis</h1>
<p>Mespilus monogyna var. glastonburiensis, commonly known as the Glastonbury Thorn, is a rare and ancient variety of the common medlar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that ripen in the autumn, though they are typically not consumed due to their astringent taste.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its historical significance and is often found in old gardens and woodland edges.</p>
