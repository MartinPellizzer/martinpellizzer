                    <h1>Melocactus onychacanthus</h1>
<p>Melocactus onychacanthus, commonly known as the black-tipped melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a dark, almost black, waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its dark foliage. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having spines that provide shade and protection.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens.</p>
