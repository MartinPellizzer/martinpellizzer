                    <h1>Muluorchis ramosa</h1>
<p>Muluorchis ramosa, commonly known as the ramose orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude forests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rich, humus-laden soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Muluorchis ramosa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
