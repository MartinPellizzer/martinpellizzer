                    <h1>Mollugo verticillata var. scrobiculata</h1>
<p>Mollugo verticillata var. scrobiculata, commonly known as the carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a persistent weed in cultivated settings.</p>
