                    <h1>Marcetia decussata</h1>
<p>Marcetia decussata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they cross each other in pairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Marcetia decussata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
