<p>Mollugo nudicaulis var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers throughout the growing season, which are followed by elliptical, translucent seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptive morphology and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
