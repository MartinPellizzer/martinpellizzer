                    <h1>Menonvillea parvula</h1>
<p>Menonvillea parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered menonvillea, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces a single inflorescence with several tiny blooms, each featuring three petals and three sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Menonvillea parvula is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
