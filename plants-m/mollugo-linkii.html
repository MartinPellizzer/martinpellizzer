                    <h1>Mollugo linkii</h1>
<p>Mollugo linkii, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Molluginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in arid and saline environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Mollugo linkii produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, enabling it to colonize new areas along the coastline.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
