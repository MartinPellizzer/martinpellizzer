                    <h1>Melaleuca undulata var. minor</h1>
<p>Melaleuca undulata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and peeling, papery bark that reveals a smooth, pale inner layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
