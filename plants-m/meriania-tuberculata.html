                    <h1>Meriania tuberculata</h1>
<p>Meriania tuberculata, commonly known as the waxy leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
