<p>Microtoena megacalyx, commonly known as the giant calyx orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy floral structures and distinctive calyx-like bracts that encase the flower. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation.</p>
