                    <h1>Mazus</h1>
<p>Mazus, commonly known as the "lucky plant" or "lucky grass," is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white. Mazus thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats over time.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Mazus*, is derived from the Latin word for "mazus," which refers to its resemblance to the ancient plant *Mazus ramosus*.</p>
