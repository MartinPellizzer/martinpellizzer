                    <h1>Microlepia inaequalis var. minor</h1>
<p>Microlepia inaequalis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser microlepia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'minor' distinguishes it from the typical variety by its smaller size and more compact growth habit.</p>
