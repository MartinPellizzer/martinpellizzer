                    <h1>Myrmecophila thomsoniana var. minor</h1>
<p>Myrmecophila thomsoniana var. minor, commonly known as the Thomson's ant plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which provides a habitat for ants. The plant's structure supports a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
