                    <h1>Mentha arenaria</h1>
<p>Mentha arenaria, commonly known as sand mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in whorled clusters, and its aromatic leaves emit a minty scent when crushed. Mentha arenaria is characterized by its creeping growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a ground cover in ecological restoration projects.</p>
