                    <h1>Mapouria ornithophila</h1>
<p>Mapouria ornithophila, commonly known as the bird's nest plant, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that resemble a bird's nest. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Mapouria ornithophila is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
