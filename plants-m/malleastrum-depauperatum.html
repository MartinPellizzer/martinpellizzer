                    <h1>Malleastrum depauperatum</h1>
<p>Malleastrum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces delicate pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a soft color to its habitat. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Malleastrum depauperatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
