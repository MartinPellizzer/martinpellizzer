                    <h1>Macrothelypteris hirtirachis</h1>
<p>Macrothelypteris hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
