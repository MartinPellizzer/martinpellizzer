<p>Microlepia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Microlepia nepalensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
