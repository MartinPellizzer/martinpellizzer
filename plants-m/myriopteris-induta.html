<p>Myriopteris induta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves.</p>
<p>Myriopteris induta is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and its ability to thrive in humid, acidic soils.</p>
