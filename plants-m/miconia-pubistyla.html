<p>Miconia pubistyla, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators.</p>
