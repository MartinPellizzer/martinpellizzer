                    <h1>Malaxis xerophila</h1>
<p>Malaxis xerophila, commonly known as the dryland malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a short spur, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
