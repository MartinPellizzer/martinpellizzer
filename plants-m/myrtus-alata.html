                    <h1>Myrtus alata</h1>
<p>Myrtus alata, commonly known as the silver myrtle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, waxy coating on its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries. Myrtus alata is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
