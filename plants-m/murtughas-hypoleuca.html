                    <h1>Murtughas hypoleuca</h1>
<p>Murtughas hypoleuca, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers during the cooler months. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
