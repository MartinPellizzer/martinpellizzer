<p>Mesadenia reniformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf or kidney vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and trail along supports.</p>
<p>Mesadenia reniformis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shady conditions.</p>
