                    <h1>Mandragora tibetica</h1>
<p>Mandragora tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan mandrake, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers and red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
