<p>Montia alsinoides, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a small annual herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
