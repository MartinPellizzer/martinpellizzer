<p>Miconia splendens, commonly known as the golden miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a velvety texture and a striking metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
