                    <h1>Megacarpaea iliensis</h1>
<p>Megacarpaea iliensis, commonly known as the Ili Valley giant cypress, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research.</p>
