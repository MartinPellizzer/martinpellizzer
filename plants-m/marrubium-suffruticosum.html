<p>Marrubium suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping horehound, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling stem that often forms dense mats, with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and sandy plains.</p>
<p>Marrubium suffruticosum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties.</p>
