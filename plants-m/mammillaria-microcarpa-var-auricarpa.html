<p>Mammillaria microcarpa var. auricarpa, commonly known as the golden ear cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem with prominent, white to pale yellow tubercles that give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden setting.</p>
