<p>Missiessya hypoleuca, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, waxy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should not be ingested by humans or pets.</p>
