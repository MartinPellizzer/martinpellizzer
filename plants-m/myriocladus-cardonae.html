<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
