                    <h1>Medicago lappacea var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Medicago lappacea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited goatweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
