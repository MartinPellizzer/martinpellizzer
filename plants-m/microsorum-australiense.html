<p>Microsorum australiense, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum australiense plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
