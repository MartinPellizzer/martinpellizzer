                    <h1>Mucuna humblotii</h1>
<p>Mucuna humblotii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable in agricultural systems.</p>
<p>However, the seeds contain toxic alkaloids, requiring caution in cultivation and use.</p>
