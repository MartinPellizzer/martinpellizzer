                    <h1>Mimosa dealbata</h1>
<p>Mimosa dealbata, commonly known as the silver mimosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking silver-white color in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, pale pink seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
