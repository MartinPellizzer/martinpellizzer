                    <h1>Marsilea hirsuta var. exarata</h1>
<p>Marsilea hirsuta var. exarata, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sori that are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its hairy texture and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens.</p>
