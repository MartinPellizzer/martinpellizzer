<p>Mentha stolonifera, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its horizontal stolons, which allow it to spread rapidly across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or blue, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are aromatic, with a strong minty scent, and it is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Mentha stolonifera is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
