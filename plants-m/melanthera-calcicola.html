                    <h1>Melanthera calcicola</h1>
<p>Melanthera calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, alkaline environments. Its leaves often have a bladders-like structure, which may aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Melanthera calcicola is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in the presence of calcium-rich substrates.</p>
