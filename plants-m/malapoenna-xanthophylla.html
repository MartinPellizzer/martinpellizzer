<p>Malapoenna xanthophylla, commonly known as the yellowleaf malapoenna, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which is due to the presence of carotenoids in its leaves.

It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
