                    <h1>Monactis subdeltoidea</h1>
<p>Monactis subdeltoidea, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Monactis subdeltoidea plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
