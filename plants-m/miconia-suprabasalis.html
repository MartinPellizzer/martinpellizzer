                    <h1>Miconia suprabasalis</h1>
<p>Miconia suprabasalis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Miconia* tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
