<p>Menodora pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Menodoreaceae and is characterized by its compound, pinnatisected leaves that give it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in certain horticultural settings.</p>
