<p>Mediocalcar versteegii subsp.</p>
<p>vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude and volcanic substrates.</p>
