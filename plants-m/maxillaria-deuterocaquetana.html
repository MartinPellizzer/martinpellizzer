<p>Maxillaria deuterocaquetana, commonly known as the Caquet√° orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Amazon rainforest of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip that is intricately patterned. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
