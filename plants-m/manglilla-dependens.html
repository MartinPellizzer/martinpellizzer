<p>Manglilla dependens, commonly known as the hanging mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It exhibits a unique growth habit with its branches and leaves hanging from the branches of mangrove trees, forming a dense, tangled mass. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant odor that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Manglilla dependens plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
