<p>Marathrum tortuosum, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a unique species of moss that exhibits intricate spiral growth patterns.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems that curl into tight spirals. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its structure allows it to efficiently absorb and retain water, which is essential for its survival in such habitats.</p>
<p>The spiral morphology of Marathrum tortuosum is not only aesthetically striking but also plays a functional role in its ecological adaptation.</p>
