<p>Melocactus roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima melon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces a single, elongated, yellowish-green fruit that is edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing at the top of the plant during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat in remote and ecologically sensitive areas, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
