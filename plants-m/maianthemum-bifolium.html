                    <h1>Maianthemum bifolium</h1>
<p>Maianthemum bifolium, commonly known as the white false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, though the name "bifolium" suggests it may have two leaflets in some instances. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
