                    <h1>Melancium campestre var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Melancium campestre var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate field melancium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its intermediate characteristics between the two parent species, Melancium campestre and Melancium alpinum.</p>
