                    <h1>Microula mustangensis</h1>
<p>Microula mustangensis, commonly known as the Mustang microula, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which helps it blend with its desert environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
