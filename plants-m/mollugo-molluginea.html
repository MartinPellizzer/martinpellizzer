<p>Mollugo molluginea, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed.</p>
<p>Mollugo molluginea is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
