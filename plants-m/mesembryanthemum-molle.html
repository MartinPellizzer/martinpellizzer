                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum molle</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum molle, commonly known as the woolly bush or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care.</p>
