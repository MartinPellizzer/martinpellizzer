                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum transvaalense</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum transvaalense, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
