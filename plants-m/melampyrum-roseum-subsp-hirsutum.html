<p>Melampyrum roseum subsp.</p>
<p>hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine, short hairs. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, often resembling small, delicate candles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
