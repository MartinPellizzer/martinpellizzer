                    <h1>Mimosa filicina</h1>
<p>Mimosa filicina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and educational settings.</p>
