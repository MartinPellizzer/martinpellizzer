                    <h1>Macrothelypteris paludosa</h1>
<p>Macrothelypteris paludosa, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
