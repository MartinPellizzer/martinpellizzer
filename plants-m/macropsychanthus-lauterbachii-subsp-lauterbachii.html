<p>Macropsychanthus lauterbachii subsp.</p>
<p>lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions, often after rainfall.</p>
<p>The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a delicate, almost ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of arid ecosystem health.</p>
