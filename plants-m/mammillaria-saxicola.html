<p>Mammillaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock mammillaria, is a compact cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
