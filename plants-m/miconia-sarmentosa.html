<p>Miconia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
