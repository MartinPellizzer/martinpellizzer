                    <h1>Mimosa calodendron var. leprosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa calodendron var. leprosa, commonly known as the white mimosa, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to shed its leaves in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty.</p>
