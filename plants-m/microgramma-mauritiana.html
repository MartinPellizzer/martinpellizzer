<p>Microgramma mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Microgramma mauritiana is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
