                    <h1>Microcoelia corallina</h1>
<p>Microcoelia corallina, commonly known as the coral lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal environments, particularly on rock surfaces exposed to salt spray and tidal action. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to substrates, allowing it to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its reproductive structures are microscopic, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores.</p>
<p>Microcoelia corallina plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
