<p>Macrocarpaea calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain several seeds.</p>
