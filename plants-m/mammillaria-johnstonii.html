                    <h1>Mammillaria johnstonii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short stems near the top of the plant. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
