<p>Manihot esculenta var. nodosa, commonly known as the swollen manioc or bitter manioc, is a variant of the manioc plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its swollen, starchy roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain toxic cyanogenic glycosides. The leaves are typically large and heart-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct odor. The plant is cultivated for its edible roots, which require processing to remove harmful compounds before consumption.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the diet and agriculture of many communities in the tropics.</p>
