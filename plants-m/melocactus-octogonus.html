<p>Melocactus octogonus, commonly known as the eight-spined melon cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, columnar stem and a distinctive crown of spines, typically numbering eight, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise spiky appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
