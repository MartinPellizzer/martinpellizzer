<p>Minuartia fasciculata subsp.</p>
<p>funkii, commonly known as the rock louse, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub or coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
