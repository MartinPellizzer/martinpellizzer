                    <h1>Melica jacquemontii f. scabra</h1>
<p>Melica jacquemontii f. scabra, commonly known as the scabrous meadowgrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in its native environment.</p>
