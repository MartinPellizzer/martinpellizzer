<p>Myriocarpa obscura, commonly known as the ghost bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a thick, leathery pod that can persist in the soil for years, allowing the plant to regenerate after periods of drought.</p>
