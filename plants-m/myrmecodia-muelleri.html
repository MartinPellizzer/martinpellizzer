                    <h1>Myrmecodia muelleri</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia muelleri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, which in turn protect it from herbivores and help with nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are small and opposite, and it produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its fascinating ecological interactions.</p>
