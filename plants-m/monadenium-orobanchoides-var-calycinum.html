                    <h1>Monadenium orobanchoides var. calycinum</h1>
<p>Monadenium orobanchoides var. calycinum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
