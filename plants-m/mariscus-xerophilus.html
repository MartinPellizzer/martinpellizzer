                    <h1>Mariscus xerophilus</h1>
<p>Mariscus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert marigold, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments.</p>
