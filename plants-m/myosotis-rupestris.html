<p>Myosotis rupestris, commonly known as the rock forget-me-not, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Myosotis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
