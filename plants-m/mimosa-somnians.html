                    <h1>Mimosa somnians</h1>
<p>Mimosa somnians, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by feathery pods that split open when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and a fascinating addition to gardens.</p>
