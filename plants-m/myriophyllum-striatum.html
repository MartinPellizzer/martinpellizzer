                    <h1>Myriophyllum striatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum striatum, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is rooted in the substrate and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are often flexible and can form dense underwater stands, contributing to water clarity by reducing wave action.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum striatum is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
