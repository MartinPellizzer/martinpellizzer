<p>Yellow sweetclover, scientifically known as Medicago lupulina subsp. secundiflora, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern regions of North America. This plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, making it easily identifiable in various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides, pastures, and forest edges. Yellow sweetclover plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and supporting pollinators. However, it can also become invasive in certain environments, requiring careful management.</p>
