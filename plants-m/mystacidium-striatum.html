<p>Mystacidium striatum, commonly known as the striped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant exhibits a distinctive striped pattern on its surface, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Mystacidium striatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
