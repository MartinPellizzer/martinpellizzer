This species is endemic to a small region, making it highly vulnerable to habitat loss. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered plant by conservationists. Studying Microchirita sahyadriensis provides valuable insights into the biodiversity of the Western Ghats and the need for conservation efforts.</p>
