<p>Mimosa altoparanensis, commonly known as the Parana mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often compound leaves. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonastic response. It produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to seasonal wetlands and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
