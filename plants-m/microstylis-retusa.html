<p>Microstylis retusa, commonly known as the smooth-styled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Microstylis retusa is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
