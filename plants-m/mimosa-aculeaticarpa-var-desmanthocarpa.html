<p>Mimosa aculeaticarpa var. desmanthocarpa, commonly known as the velvet mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its sensitive leaves, which fold shut when touched, a trait shared with other mimosa species.</p>
