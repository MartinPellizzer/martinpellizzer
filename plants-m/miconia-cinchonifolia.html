<p>Miconia cinchonifolia, commonly known as the red miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
