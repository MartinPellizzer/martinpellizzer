                    <h1>Mitrospora recurvata</h1>
<p>Mitrospora recurvata, commonly known as the recurved mitrospora, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Microascaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark, and globose to subglobose ascospores, which are typically 14â€“20 micrometers in diameter. The plant forms its spores within ascocarps, which are cup-shaped and often reddish-brown in color. It is commonly found on decaying wood and other organic substrates in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its microscopic size and specific habitat, it is not widely studied but plays a role in the decomposition process in its ecosystem.</p>
