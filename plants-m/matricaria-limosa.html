                    <h1>Matricaria limosa</h1>
<p>Matricaria limosa, commonly known as the swamp chamomile, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, branching stem covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that resemble those of chamomile, though they are typically less showy. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Matricaria limosa is often found in riparian zones and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
