<p>Myrciaria cauliflora, commonly known as the araçá-do-brejo, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are rich in vitamin C and are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a strong aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Myrciaria cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties.</p>
