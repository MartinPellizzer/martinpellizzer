<p>Mimosa dolens var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and unique leaf behavior make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections.</p>
