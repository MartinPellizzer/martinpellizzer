                    <h1>Malaxis palmicola</h1>
<p>Malaxis palmicola, commonly known as the palm-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are long and strap-like, resembling palm fronds, which is reflected in its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Malaxis palmicola is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
