                    <h1>Melpomene caput-gorgonis</h1>
<p>Melpomene caput-gorgonis, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns sea star, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Astropectinidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often colorful body, which can range from red to orange and yellow. This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, typically inhabiting shallow reef environments. The plant-like appearance of its arms, which can resemble flowers, has led to its common name.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true plant but a member of the echinoderm phylum, and it plays an important ecological role in its marine habitat.</p>
