                    <h1>Maranta ornata</h1>
<p>Maranta ornata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage that changes color in response to light conditions. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is thought to help conserve moisture. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically during the summer months.</p>
<p>Maranta ornata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
