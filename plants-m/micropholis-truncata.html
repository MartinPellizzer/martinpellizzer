                    <h1>Micropholis truncata</h1>
<p>Micropholis truncata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, truncate-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Micropholis truncata is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
