<p>Minuartia mutabilis subsp.</p>
<p>balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to extreme climatic conditions and is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience.</p>
