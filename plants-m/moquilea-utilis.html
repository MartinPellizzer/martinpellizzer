                    <h1>Moquilea utilis</h1>
<p>Moquilea utilis, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Moquilea utilis is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance as a food source for desert wildlife.</p>
