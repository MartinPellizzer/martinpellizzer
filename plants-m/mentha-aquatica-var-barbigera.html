                    <h1>Mentha aquatica var. barbigera</h1>
<p>Mentha aquatica var. barbigera, commonly known as the water mint, is a variant of the water mint species native to moist, often aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typical of the mint family. It thrives in wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows.</p>
<p>Its essential oils, like those of other mints, contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
