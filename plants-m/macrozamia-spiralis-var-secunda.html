                    <h1>Macrozamia spiralis var. secunda</h1>
<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. secunda, commonly known as the spiral cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
