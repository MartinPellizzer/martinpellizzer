                    <h1>Microthelys intagana</h1>
<p>Microthelys intagana, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Microthelys intagana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
