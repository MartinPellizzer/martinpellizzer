                    <h1>Meconopsis nipalensis</h1>
<p>Meconopsis nipalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet flowers, which bloom in spring and are often surrounded by velvety, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Its flowers are relatively small, usually less than 5 cm in diameter, but they are highly ornamental and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Meconopsis nipalensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
