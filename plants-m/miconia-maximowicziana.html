<p>Miconia maximowicziana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a distinctive, fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
