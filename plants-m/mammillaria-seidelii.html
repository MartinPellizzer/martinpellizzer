<p>Mammillaria seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
