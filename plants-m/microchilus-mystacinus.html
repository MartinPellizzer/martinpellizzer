                    <h1>Microchilus mystacinus</h1>
<p>Microchilus mystacinus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, making it difficult to identify. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
