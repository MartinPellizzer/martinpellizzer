                    <h1>Monochoria plantaginea</h1>
<p>Monochoria plantaginea, commonly known as the water croton, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Monochoria plantaginea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
