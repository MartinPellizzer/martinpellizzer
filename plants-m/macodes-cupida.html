                    <h1>Macodes cupida</h1>
<p>Macodes cupida, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to the forests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Macodes cupida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
