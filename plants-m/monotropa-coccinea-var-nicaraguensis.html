                    <h1>Monotropa coccinea var. nicaraguensis</h1>
<p>Monotropa coccinea var. nicaraguensis, commonly known as the red ghost plant, is a hemiparasitic vine native to Central America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other vegetation. The plant produces small, red, bell-shaped flowers that are often mistaken for berries due to their appearance. Its unique morphology and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
