                    <h1>Myristica markgraviana</h1>
<p>Myristica markgraviana, commonly known as the Maluku nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen belonging to the Myristicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Moluccas (formerly the Spice Islands) in Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and develops aromatic, ellipsoid fruits that contain a single seed. Its seeds are encased in a reddish outer layer and a white, oily inner part, both of which are used in traditional medicine and as spices.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its essential oils, which have been historically used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent.</p>
