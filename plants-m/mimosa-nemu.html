                    <h1>Mimosa nemu</h1>
<p>Mimosa nemu, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa nemu is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and delicate appearance.</p>
