                    <h1>Meristostylus brachycalyx</h1>
<p>Meristostylus brachycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-calyx mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Its growth is restricted to specific regions in Australia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
