<p>Misanteca schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds.</p>
