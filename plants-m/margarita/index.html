                            <h1>Margarita</h1>
<p>The margarita plant, also known as the margarita flower, is a striking member of the nightshade family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is known for its vibrant blue and purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its unique appearance and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both fascination and caution. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
