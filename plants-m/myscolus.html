                    <h1>Myscolus</h1>
<p>Myscolus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Myscolus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
