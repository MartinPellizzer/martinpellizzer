                    <h1>Miconia spicellata</h1>
<p>Miconia spicellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, orange-red fruits. Miconia spicellata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems, though its spread can have negative ecological impacts.</p>
