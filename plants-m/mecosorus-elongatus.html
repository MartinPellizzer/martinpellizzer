<p>Mecosorus elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, creeping stems that form dense, carpet-like mats on moist, shaded forest floors. The plant exhibits a simple yet robust structure, with leafy shoots that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are typically borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Mecosorus elongatus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
