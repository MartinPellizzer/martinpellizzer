                    <h1>Miconia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Miconia epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not closely related to true ferns. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Miconia epiphytica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
