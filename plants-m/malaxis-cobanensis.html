                    <h1>Malaxis cobanensis</h1>
<p>Malaxis cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Malaxis cobanensis is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
