<p>Microsorum jinfoshanense, commonly known as the Jinfoshan sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant along the substrate.</p>
<p>Microsorum jinfoshanense is valued in both horticulture and ecological restoration due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to improve water quality.</p>
