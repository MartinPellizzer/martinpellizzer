<p>Mollugo pentaphylla, commonly known as bladder campion, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures in its leaves, which can store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Mollugo pentaphylla is often used in gardens as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
