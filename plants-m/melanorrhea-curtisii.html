                    <h1>Melanorrhea curtisii</h1>
<p>Melanorrhea curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several countries.</p>
