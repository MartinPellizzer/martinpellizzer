<p>Marsilea gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seeded water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette shape, with each leaflet resembling a small clover leaf. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that develop into distinctive, seedless fruits called glochidia, which are often used as food by certain aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and reproductive strategy make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
