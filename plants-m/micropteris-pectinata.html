<p>Micropteris pectinata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are adorned with a distinctive, cinnamon-brown fiddlehead at the base. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Micropteris pectinata is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
