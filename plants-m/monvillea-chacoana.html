<p>Monvillea chacoana, commonly known as the Chacoan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the dry Chaco region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
