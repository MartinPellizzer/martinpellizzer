<p>Mammilloydia, commonly known as the star cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and the presence of tubercles, which are small, rounded bumps on the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Mammilloydia species are native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are well adapted to dry environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems.</p>
