                    <h1>Macropsychanthus wilsonii</h1>
<p>Macropsychanthus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and small, pale blue or white petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for alpine ecosystems and its potential for medicinal research.</p>
