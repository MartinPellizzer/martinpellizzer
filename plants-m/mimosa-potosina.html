                    <h1>Mimosa potosina</h1>
<p>Mimosa potosina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its growth habit is upright, with stems that can reach up to 3 feet in height under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>Mimosa potosina thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
