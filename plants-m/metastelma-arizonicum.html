<p>Metastelma arizonicum, commonly known as Arizona ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
