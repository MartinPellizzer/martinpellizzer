                    <h1>Mentha aquatica f. lobeliana</h1>
<p>Mentha aquatica f. lobeliana, commonly known as narrow-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Mentha aquatica. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
