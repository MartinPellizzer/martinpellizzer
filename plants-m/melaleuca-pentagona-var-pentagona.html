<p>Melaleuca pentagona var. pentagona, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which appear in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
