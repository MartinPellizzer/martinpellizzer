                    <h1>Micrantheum triandrum</h1>
<p>Micrantheum triandrum, commonly known as the small-flowered triandrum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with its flowering stems arising from the base of the plant. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Micrantheum triandrum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
