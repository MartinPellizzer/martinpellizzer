                    <h1>Malaxis aporophylla</h1>
<p>Malaxis aporophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small, white or pale green flowers bloom in clusters, often with a distinct, faintly fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Malaxis aporophylla is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
