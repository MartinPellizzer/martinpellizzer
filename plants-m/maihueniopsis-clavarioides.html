                    <h1>Maihueniopsis clavarioides</h1>
<p>Maihueniopsis clavarioides, commonly known as the Andean coral fungus, is a unique lichen-forming species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its coral-like, branching thallus structure. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its growth is typically slow, and it often forms dense mats on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
