                    <h1>Machaerina borneense</h1>
<p>Machaerina borneense, commonly known as the Bornean machaerina, is a flowering plant native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a fragrant scent. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the tropical rainforest environment.</p>
<p>Machaerina borneense is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it thrives in the humid and shaded conditions of the understory.</p>
