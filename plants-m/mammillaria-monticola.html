<p>Mammillaria monticola, commonly known as the Mexican globose cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a crown of radial spines. The plant features prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the spines.</p>
<p>Mammillaria monticola is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
