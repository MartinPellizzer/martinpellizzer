                    <h1>Melaleuca ferrea</h1>
<p>Melaleuca ferrea, commonly known as broad-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a reddish inner layer. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. Its small, fragrant white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and appear in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>Melaleuca ferrea is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
