                    <h1>Mimosa leptocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa leptocarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Mimosa leptocarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility.</p>
