                    <h1>Mystacidium infundibulare</h1>
<p>Mystacidium infundibulare, commonly known as the funnel-shaped liverwort, is a thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded rocky surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It produces small, stalked capsules for spore dispersal, which are typically clustered at the tips of the thallus.</p>
<p>Mystacidium infundibulare is often found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
