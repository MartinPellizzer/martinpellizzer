                    <h1>Mildbraedia klaineana</h1>
<p>Mildbraedia klaineana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
