                    <h1>Myrmecodia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia lanceolata, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It forms a specialized symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, providing them with shelter and nourishment in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant's structure consists of a swollen stem with hollow chambers that serve as nesting sites for the ants. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are often hidden within the ant colonies, making it a fascinating example of mutualistic adaptation in botanical ecosystems.</p>
