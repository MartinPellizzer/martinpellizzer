                <h1>Mariscus fasciculiger</h1>
<p>Mariscus fasciculiger, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often arranged in clusters, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Mariscus fasciculiger is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
