<p>Masdevallia pulvinaris, commonly known as the cushion masdevallia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. The plant produces small, intricately patterned flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its pseudobulbs are short and clustered, and it has linear, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Masdevallia pulvinaris is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
