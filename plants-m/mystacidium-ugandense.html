                    <h1>Mystacidium ugandense</h1>
<p>Mystacidium ugandense, commonly known as the Uganda mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host. It is native to East Africa, particularly Uganda, and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
