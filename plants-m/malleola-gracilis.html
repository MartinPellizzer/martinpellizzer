<p>Malleola gracilis, commonly known as the slender malleola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Malleola gracilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
