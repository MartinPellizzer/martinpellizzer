                    <h1>Mimosa macrostachys</h1>
<p>Mimosa macrostachys, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a striking member of the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
