<p>Maieta neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's mayflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Maieta neblinensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
