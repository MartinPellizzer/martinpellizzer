<p>Malaxis schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its intricate, spiraled inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring or early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
