<p>Monadenium yattanum var. gladiatum, commonly known as the gladiate monadenium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth habit and features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
