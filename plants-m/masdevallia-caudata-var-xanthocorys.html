                    <h1>Masdevallia caudata var. xanthocorys</h1>
<p>Masdevallia caudata var. xanthocorys, commonly known as the yellow-streaked masdevallia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its striking yellow markings on the dorsal sepal and petals, which contrast with its typically green or brown base color. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with new growths emerging from the base of the previous growths. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a spike, often in shades of white, yellow, and green.</p>
<p>It prefers cool, high-altitude environments and requires high humidity and good air circulation to thrive.</p>
