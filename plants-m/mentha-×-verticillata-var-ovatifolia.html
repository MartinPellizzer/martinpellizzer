                    <h1>Mentha × verticillata var. ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Mentha × verticillata var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate leaves that are often broader than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typical of the Mentha genus. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in wetland areas.</p>
