<p>Mollugo hirta, commonly known as hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has small, hairy leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients. It is an annual plant, completing its life cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>Mollugo hirta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
