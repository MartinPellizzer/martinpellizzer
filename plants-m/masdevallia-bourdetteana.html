The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, misty conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
