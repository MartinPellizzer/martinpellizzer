<p>Minuartia greuteriana, commonly known as the Greuter's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Minuartia greuteriana is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme conditions.</p>
