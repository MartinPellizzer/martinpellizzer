                    <h1>Mentha sylvestris var. compacta</h1>
<p>Mentha sylvestris var. compacta, commonly known as narrow-leaf mint, is a compact, aromatic perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, bushy growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fragrant when crushed, emitting a strong minty scent due to high concentrations of menthol and other volatile oils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of essential oils.</p>
