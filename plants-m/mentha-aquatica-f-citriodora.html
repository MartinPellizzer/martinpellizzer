<p>Mentha aquatica f. citriodora, commonly known as lemon mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a fragrant, citrus-like aroma that is more pronounced than in other mint species.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, appearing in spikes during the summer months.</p>
