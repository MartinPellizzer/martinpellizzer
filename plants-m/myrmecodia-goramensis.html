                    <h1>Myrmecodia goramensis</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia goramensis, commonly known as the horned antplant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are small,革质 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia goramensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
