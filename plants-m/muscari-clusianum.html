                    <h1>Muscari clusianum</h1>
<p>Muscari clusianum, commonly known as the Persian glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its bulbs are toxic if ingested, so care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
<p>Muscari clusianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions.</p>
