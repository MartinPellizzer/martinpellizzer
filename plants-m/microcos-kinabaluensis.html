                    <h1>Microcos kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Microcos kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Borneo microcos, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, which help it adapt to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded forest areas, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
