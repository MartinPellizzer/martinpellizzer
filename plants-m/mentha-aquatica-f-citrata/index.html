<p>Citron mint, scientifically known as Mentha aquatica f. citrata, is a unique hybrid plant that combines the refreshing qualities of mint with a distinct citrus aroma. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in moist environments and is often found near streams or ponds. Its leaves are oval-shaped and emit a zesty scent when crushed, making it a popular choice for herbal teas and culinary uses. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in natural settings. Despite its delicate appearance, citron mint is hardy and adaptable, making it a versatile addition to gardens and ecosystems.</p>
