<p>Marsilea brachypus, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are submerged, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Marsilea brachypus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
