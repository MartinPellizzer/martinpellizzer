                    <h1>Miconia strangulata</h1>
<p>Miconia strangulata, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and vine-like habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fig-like fruits. Its roots can encircle and strangle host trees, leading to their death, which is why it is called a strangler.</p>
<p>This aggressive growth pattern makes it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas.</p>
