                    <h1>Mapania insignis</h1>
<p>Mapania insignis, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mapania insignis is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
