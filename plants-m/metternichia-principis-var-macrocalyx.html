The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
