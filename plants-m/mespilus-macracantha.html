                    <h1>Mespilus macracantha</h1>
<p>Mespilus macracantha, commonly known as the large-fruited medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, apple-like fruits. These fruits undergo a unique ripening process, turning from green to a deep red or purple color when mature.</p>
<p>Mespilus macracantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
