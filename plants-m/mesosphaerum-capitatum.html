                    <h1>Mesosphaerum capitatum</h1>
<p>Mesosphaerum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered globular cactus, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with dense clusters of small, spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Mesosphaerum capitatum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
