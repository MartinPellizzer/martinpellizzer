                    <h1>Myrmecodia albertisii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia albertisii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like stem that serves as a habitat for ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often hidden within its leaf-like structures. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, while its aerial roots form symbiotic relationships with ants.</p>
<p>Myrmecodia albertisii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
