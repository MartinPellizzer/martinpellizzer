<p>Mapania radulosa, commonly known as the Florida panther lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, elongated seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mapania radulosa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
