                    <h1>Minuartia tenuifolia subvar. viscidula</h1>
<p>Minuartia tenuifolia subvar. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its adaptations to harsh, dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaping.</p>
