<p>Manilkara fouilloyana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree bears round, smooth, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single, large, white seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
