<p>Malaxis inexspectata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
