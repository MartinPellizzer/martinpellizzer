                    <h1>Maxillaria cleistogama</h1>
<p>Maxillaria cleistogama, commonly known as the closed-flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cleistogamous flowering habit, where the flowers remain closed and self-pollinate without opening. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow pseudobulbs that bear leaves and flower spikes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Maxillaria cleistogama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments.</p>
