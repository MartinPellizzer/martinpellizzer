Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
