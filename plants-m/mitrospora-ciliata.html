                    <h1>Mitrospora ciliata</h1>
<p>Mitrospora ciliata, commonly known as the velvet fungus, is a basidiomycete fungus characterized by its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>
<p>It produces small, club-shaped fruiting bodies called basidia, which are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The spores are typically released in a sticky, viscous mass, which aids in their dispersal. This fungus is often found on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed woodland environments.</p>
