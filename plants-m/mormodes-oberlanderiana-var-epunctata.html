<p>Mormodes oberlanderiana var. epunctata, commonly known as the spotted mormode, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, colorful inflorescence that features a spadix surrounded by a spathe with distinctive spots. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
