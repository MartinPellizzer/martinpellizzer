<p>Mostacillastrum vaseyi, commonly known as the Desert Grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Mostacillastrum vaseyi is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability.</p>
