<p>Mystacidium muscicola, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, leafy body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are often clustered at the tips of the thallus.</p>
