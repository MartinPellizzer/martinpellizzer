<p>Malus communis subsp.</p>
<p>sylvestris, commonly known as the wild apple, is a species native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters.</p>
<p>The plant produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sour fruits in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a wild relative of the domesticated apple (Malus domestica) and is valued for its genetic diversity.</p>
