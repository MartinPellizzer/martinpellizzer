<p>Myosotis lingulata proles stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, blue or violet flowers with five petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize suitable habitats effectively.</p>
