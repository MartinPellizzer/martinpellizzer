<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
