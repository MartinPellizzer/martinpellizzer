                    <h1>Mesembryanthus glaucus</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthus glaucus, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthus glaucus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
