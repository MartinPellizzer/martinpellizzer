<p>Melica pallida, commonly known as pale meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, leafy stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Pale meadowgrass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
