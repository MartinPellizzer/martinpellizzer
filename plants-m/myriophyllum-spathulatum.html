                    <h1>Myriophyllum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum spathulatum, commonly known as broad-leaf watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Myriophyllum spathulatum is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams, where it can form dense underwater stands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
