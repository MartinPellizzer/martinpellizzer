<p>Macroclinium subroseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), helping it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
