                    <h1>Metastelma selerianum</h1>
<p>Metastelma selerianum, commonly known as the Selerianum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a capsule that releases minute seeds, which can adhere to the bark of potential host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
