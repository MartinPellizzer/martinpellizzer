<p>Mimosa daleoides f. psammophila, commonly known as the sand mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert regions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
