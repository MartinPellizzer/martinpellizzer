                    <h1>Mimosa concordiana</h1>
<p>Mimosa concordiana, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Mimosa concordiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
