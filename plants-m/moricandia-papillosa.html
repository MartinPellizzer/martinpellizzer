<p>Moricandia papillosa, commonly known as the silky cress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces slender, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit. Moricandia papillosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
