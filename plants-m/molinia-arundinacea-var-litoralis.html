                    <h1>Molinia arundinacea var. litoralis</h1>
<p>Molinia arundinacea var. litoralis, commonly known as sea moorgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and windy environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
