<p>Medinilla alpestris, commonly known as the alpine medinilla, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the Christmas bell. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Medinilla alpestris is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
