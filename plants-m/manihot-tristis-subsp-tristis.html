<p>Manihot tristis subsp.</p>
<p>tristis, commonly known as the bittercup or bitter cassava, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, black seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its high concentration of toxic compounds, particularly hydrocyanic acid, which makes it potentially hazardous if not properly processed.</p>
