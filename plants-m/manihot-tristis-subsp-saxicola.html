<p>Manihot tristis subsp.</p>
<p>saxicola, commonly known as the rock manioc, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible roots, though it is less commonly used than other manioc species.</p>
