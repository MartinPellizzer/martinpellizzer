<p>Macropanax paucinervis, commonly known as the few-veined macropanax, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves with a minimal number of veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark berries as its fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
