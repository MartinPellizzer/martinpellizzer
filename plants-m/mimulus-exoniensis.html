<p>Mimulus exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter water primrose, is a rare aquatic plant native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Mimulus exoniensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
