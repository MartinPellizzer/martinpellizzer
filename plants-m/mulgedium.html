<p>Mulgedium, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often branching and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, making it a striking addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Mulgedium is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
