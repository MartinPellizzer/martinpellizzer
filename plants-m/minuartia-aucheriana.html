                    <h1>Minuartia aucheriana</h1>
<p>Minuartia aucheriana, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Minuartia aucheriana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
