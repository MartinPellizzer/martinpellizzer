<p>Marconia propinqua, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20â€“30 centimeters and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a cluster of fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Marconia propinqua is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
