                    <h1>Misopates orontium var. pusillus</h1>
<p>Misopates orontium var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf water crowfoot, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain buoyant seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
