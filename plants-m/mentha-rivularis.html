<p>Mentha rivularis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows near water sources such as streams, ponds, and damp soils, thriving in moist environments. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped with a serrated edge. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems, and it produces aromatic, menthol-like compounds in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Mentha rivularis is often used in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its cooling properties.</p>
