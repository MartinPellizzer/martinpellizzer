<p>Microtis media subsp.</p>
<p>eremicola, commonly known as the desert microtis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. It is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land degradation.</p>
