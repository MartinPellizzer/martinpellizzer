<p>Macradenia loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble stars, with vibrant purple and white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a compact, pseudobulbous structure and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
