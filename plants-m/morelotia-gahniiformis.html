                    <h1>Morelotia gahniiformis</h1>
<p>Morelotia gahniiformis, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or yellow, appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies.</p>
