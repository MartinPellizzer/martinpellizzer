                    <h1>Mentha × piperita var. crispa</h1>
<p>Mentha × piperita var. crispa, commonly known as peppermint crispa, is a hybrid mint species characterized by its serrated, slightly hairy leaves and strong, menthol-rich aroma.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful garden plant and a potential weed.</p>
<p>The leaves are widely used in herbal teas, aromatherapy, and as a flavoring agent due to their high concentration of menthol and other volatile oils.</p>
