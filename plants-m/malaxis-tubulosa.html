                    <h1>Malaxis tubulosa</h1>
<p>Malaxis tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular malaxis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a tubular shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Malaxis tubulosa is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
