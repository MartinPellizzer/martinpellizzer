                    <h1>Morus alba f. skeletoniana</h1>
<p>Morus alba f. skeletoniana, commonly known as the skeleton leaf mulberry, is a unique variant of the white mulberry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly reduced foliage, with leaves that are thinly veined and often appearing almost skeletal. This form results from a natural mutation or genetic variation, leading to its distinctive appearance. The plant retains the typical growth habits of the common mulberry, including rapid growth and the ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unusual and visually appealing leaf structure.</p>
