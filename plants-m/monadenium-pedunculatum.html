<p>Monadenium pedunculatum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Monadenium pedunculatum is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
