                    <h1>Mentha pulegium var. cacocea</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium var. cacocea, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant contains essential oils, particularly pulegone, which are responsible for its strong, mint-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in areas where pets or livestock are present.</p>
