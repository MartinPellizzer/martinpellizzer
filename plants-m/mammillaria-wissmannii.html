<p>Mammillaria wissmannii, commonly known as the Wissmann's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular shape with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
