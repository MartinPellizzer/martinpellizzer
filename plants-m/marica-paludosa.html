<p>Marica paludosa, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, spiny, and hairy leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a head surrounded by bracts. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in marsh environments.</p>
<p>Marica paludosa is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
