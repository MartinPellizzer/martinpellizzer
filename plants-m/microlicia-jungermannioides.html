<p>Microlicia jungermannioides, commonly known as the Jungermannioid liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Jungermanniaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like thallus with a distinct central strand of cells, which helps in water transport. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient and water absorption.</p>
<p>Microlicia jungermannioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
