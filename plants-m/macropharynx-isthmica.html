<p>Macropharynx isthmica, commonly known as the Isthmian giant orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant purple and white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in the rich, organic soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
