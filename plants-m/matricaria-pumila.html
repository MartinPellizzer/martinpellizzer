                    <h1>Matricaria pumila</h1>
<p>Matricaria pumila, commonly known as the small-flowered chamomile, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tiny, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile, though it is not closely related. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces a weakly scented essential oil similar to that of chamomile. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Matricaria pumila is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its more famous relative, Matricaria chamomilla.</p>
