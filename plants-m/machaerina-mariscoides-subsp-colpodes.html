<p>Machaerina mariscoides subsp.</p>
<p>colpodes, commonly known as the coastal machaerina, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh coastal environments.</p>
