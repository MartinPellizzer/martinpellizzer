                    <h1>Matelea maritima</h1>
<p>Matelea maritima, commonly known as sea matelea, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
