<p>Maxillariella graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a slight pinkish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens.</p>
