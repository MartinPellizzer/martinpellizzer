                    <h1>Monticalia harrietiae</h1>
<p>Monticalia harrietiae, commonly known as the Harriet's monticalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
