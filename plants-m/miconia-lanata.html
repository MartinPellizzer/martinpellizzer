                    <h1>Miconia lanata</h1>
<p>Miconia lanata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are followed by large, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Miconia lanata is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical ecosystems, though it can also be invasive in certain regions.</p>
