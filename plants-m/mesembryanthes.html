                    <h1>Mesembryanthes</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthes, commonly known as ice plants, are succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in response to sunlight. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Their leaves often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and they typically flower in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>These plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
