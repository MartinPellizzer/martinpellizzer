<p>Myriopteris scariosa, commonly known as the scaly cliff brake, is a small fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and dry slopes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Myriopteris scariosa is an important component of the understory in chaparral and pine forest ecosystems.</p>
