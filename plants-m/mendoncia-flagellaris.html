<p>Mendoncia flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive flagellated appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporangia that are clustered in groups called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Mendoncia flagellaris is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
