                    <h1>Mapouria triadica</h1>
<p>Mapouria triadica, commonly known as the three-toothed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having three pointed lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
