                    <h1>Mucuna lindro</h1>
<p>Mucuna lindro, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing dark brown seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable cover crop.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
