<p>Myosurus minimus var. breviscapus, commonly known as the short-stalked mouse-ear, is a small, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
