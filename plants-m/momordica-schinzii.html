<p>Momordica schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and squash. The plant produces distinctive, warty, green fruits that turn orange when mature, often with a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are typically consumed when young and tender.</p>
