                    <h1>Monilaria chrysoleuca</h1>
<p>Monilaria chrysoleuca, commonly known as the golden leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive yellowish-green thallus with a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
