<p>Martinezia ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's martinezia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, woody stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to arid conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Martinezia ernestii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
