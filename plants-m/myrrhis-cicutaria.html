<p>Myrrhis cicutaria, commonly known as the meadow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Myrrhis cicutaria grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>It is notable for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a deterrent to herbivores.</p>
