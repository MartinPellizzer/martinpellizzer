<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 12 inches and has compact, dense foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy.

It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Menziesia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
