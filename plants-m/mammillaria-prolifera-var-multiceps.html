<p>Mammillaria prolifera var. multiceps, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles, from which short, white bristles emerge. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique clustered growth pattern and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
