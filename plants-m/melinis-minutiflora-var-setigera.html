                    <h1>Melinis minutiflora var. setigera</h1>
<p>Melinis minutiflora var. setigera, commonly known as parthenium weed, is an invasive annual grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can rapidly colonize open areas, making it a significant ecological threat. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread and persistence in new environments.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
