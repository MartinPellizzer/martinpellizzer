                    <h1>Marsilea latzii</h1>
<p>Marsilea latzii, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like leaves that float on the water surface, with tiny, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its floating leaves aid in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Marsilea latzii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
