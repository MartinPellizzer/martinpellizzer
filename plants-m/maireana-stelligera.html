<p>Maireana stelligera, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in coastal areas with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Maireana stelligera plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
