                    <h1>Myrica parvifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Myrica parvifolia var. major, commonly known as the large-fruited wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid and coastal habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue to black berries that are clustered in small umbels. These berries are an important food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>The plant's aromatic foliage and adaptability to a range of soil types make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in its native range.</p>
