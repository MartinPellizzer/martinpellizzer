<p>Myosotis antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in cold, windy environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Myosotis antarctica plays a role in the local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its fragile habitat.</p>
