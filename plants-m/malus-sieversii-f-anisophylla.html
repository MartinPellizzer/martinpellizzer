<p>Malus sieversii f. anisophylla, commonly known as the Anisophylla form of the Siberian crabapple, is a variant of the Malus sieversii species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a mix of opposite and alternate leaf arrangement, which gives it its name. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with red or pink flowers in spring. Its leaves are usually narrower and more elongated compared to the typical species, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other apple species.</p>
