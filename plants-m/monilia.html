                    <h1>Monilia</h1>
<p>Monilia, commonly known as grey mold, is a genus of fungi that primarily affects plants, causing soft, watery rot in various parts of the host.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in cool, humid environments and thrives on decaying organic matter. The fungus produces abundant spores that spread easily through the air, water, or contaminated tools. Monilia species are notorious for infecting fruits, flowers, and leaves, often leading to significant crop losses.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to persist in the soil make it a challenging pathogen to manage in agricultural settings.</p>
