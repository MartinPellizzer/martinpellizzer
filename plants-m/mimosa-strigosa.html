                    <h1>Mimosa strigosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa strigosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>The plant's unique response to touch is due to the rapid movement of water in its leaf cells, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty.</p>
