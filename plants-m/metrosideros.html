                    <h1>Metrosideros</h1>
<p>Metrosideros, commonly known as the pohutukawa or New Zealand Christmas tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Pacific Islands and Australia.</p>
<p>These evergreen trees or shrubs are characterized by their bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often associated with coastal habitats. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the bark is often flaky or fissured. Metrosideros species are well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
