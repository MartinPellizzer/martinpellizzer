<p>Mesembryanthemum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf iceplant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates.</p>
