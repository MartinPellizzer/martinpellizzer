The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean altitude.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
