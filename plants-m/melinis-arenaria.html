                    <h1>Melinis arenaria</h1>
<p>Melinis arenaria, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Sand bluestem is drought-tolerant and often found in disturbed soils, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in sandy environments.</p>
