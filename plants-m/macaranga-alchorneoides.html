                    <h1>Macaranga alchorneoides</h1>
<p>Macaranga alchorneoides, commonly known as the white macaranga, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in ecological succession.</p>
