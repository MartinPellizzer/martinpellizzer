                    <h1>Medicago × mixta</h1>
<p>Medicago × mixta, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Medicago sativa and Medicago polymorpha.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and its yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, loamy soils. It has a deep root system that helps it tolerate drought conditions, making it suitable for dryland agriculture.</p>
<p>Medicago × mixta is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility in agricultural settings.</p>
