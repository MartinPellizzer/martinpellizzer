<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its scientific name reflects its late blooming habit, as "serotinus" means "late-blooming" in Latin.</p>
<p>The flowers are tubular with two lips, a characteristic feature of the Mimulus genus.</p>
