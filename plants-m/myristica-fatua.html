                    <h1>Myristica fatua</h1>
<p>Myristica fatua, commonly known as the wild nutmeg, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fruiting bodies that contain the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine. Its seeds, similar to nutmeg, contain essential oils and have been used for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
