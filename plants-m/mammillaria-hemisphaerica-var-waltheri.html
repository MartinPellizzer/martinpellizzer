                    <h1>Mammillaria hemisphaerica var. waltheri</h1>
<p>Mammillaria hemisphaerica var. waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's hedgehog cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a short, thick stem with areoles that produce both radial and central spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a desert garden or indoor setting.</p>
