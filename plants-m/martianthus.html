                    <h1>Martianthus</h1>
<p>Martianthus, commonly known as the starlight fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its bioluminescent fronds that glow softly in the dark.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert, it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions through specialized root systems that store water efficiently. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that reduces water loss and reflects sunlight to prevent overheating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom only under specific lunar conditions, making it a rare and elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, Martianthus is highly valued in both scientific research and botanical gardens.</p>
