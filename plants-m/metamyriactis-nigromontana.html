<p>Metamyriactis nigromontana, commonly known as the black mountain mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in montane forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's structure includes a woody stem with clusters of leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for photosynthesis. It produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
