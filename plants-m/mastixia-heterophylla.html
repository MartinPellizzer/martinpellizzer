                    <h1>Mastixia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Mastixia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf mastixia, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from oval to linear, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
