<p>Malaxis dalessandroi, commonly known as the Dalessandro's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a complex root system adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood and critically endangered species.</p>
