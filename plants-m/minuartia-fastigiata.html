                    <h1>Minuartia fastigiata</h1>
<p>Minuartia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Minuartia fastigiata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
