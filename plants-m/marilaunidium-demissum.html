<p>Marilaunidium demissum, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
