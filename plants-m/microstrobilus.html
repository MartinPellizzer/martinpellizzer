                    <h1>Microstrobilus</h1>
<p>Microstrobilus, commonly known as the microsporangiate cone, is a specialized reproductive structure found in certain gymnosperms.</p>
<p>It consists of a short axis with microsporophylls that bear microsporangia, which produce pollen grains. The microstrobilus typically develops on the plant's stem or branches and plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle. Unlike megastrobilus, which contains ovules, the microstrobilus is primarily involved in pollen production.</p>
<p>Its structure is adapted to facilitate wind pollination, a common method in gymnosperms.</p>
