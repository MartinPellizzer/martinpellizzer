                    <h1>Martiodendron elatum var. occidentale</h1>
<p>Martiodendron elatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western flax or desert flax, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in soft, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to further conserve moisture.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
