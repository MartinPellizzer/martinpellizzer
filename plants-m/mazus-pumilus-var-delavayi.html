<p>Mazus pumilus var. delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's dwarf mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
