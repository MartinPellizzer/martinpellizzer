                    <h1>Marattia burkei</h1>
<p>Marattia burkei, commonly known as the Burkes' marattia, is a rare fern species native to the eastern rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, thick rhizome system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Marattia burkei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
