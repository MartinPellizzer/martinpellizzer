<p>Monobothrium schimperi, commonly known as the African liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are typically green and covered with a layer of wax. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Monobothrium schimperi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
