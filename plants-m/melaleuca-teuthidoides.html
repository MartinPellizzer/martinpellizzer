                    <h1>Melaleuca teuthidoides</h1>
<p>Melaleuca teuthidoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a white, fibrous layer beneath. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects and birds.</p>
