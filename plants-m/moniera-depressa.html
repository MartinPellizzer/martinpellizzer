                    <h1>Moniera depressa</h1>
<p>Moniera depressa, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It has slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically less than 2 centimeters wide.</p>
<p>Moniera depressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
