<p>Mariscus kitaleensis, commonly known as the Kitale marshmallow, is a rare and unique plant native to the Lake Victoria region of Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, swampy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to wetland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
