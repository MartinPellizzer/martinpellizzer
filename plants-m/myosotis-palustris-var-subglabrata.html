                    <h1>Myosotis palustris var. subglabrata</h1>
<p>Myosotis palustris var. subglabrata, commonly known as the slender water forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue-to-purple flowers with five petals. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety subglabrata has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and pollinators.</p>
