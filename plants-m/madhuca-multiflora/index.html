                            <h1>Madhuca Multiflora</h1>
<p>Madhuca multiflora is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. It features broad, glossy leaves and produces clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree is often cultivated for its shade and as a source of nectar for bees. Its fruit, called a "madhuca," is edible and has been used in traditional cuisines. This versatile plant plays a key role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
