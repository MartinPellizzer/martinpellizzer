                    <h1>Mikaniopsis</h1>
<p>Mikaniopsis, commonly known as the creeping grass or false grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread rapidly across various habitats. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Mikaniopsis species are often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
