                    <h1>Medicago littoralis var. breviseta</h1>
<p>Medicago littoralis var. breviseta, commonly known as the coastal medic, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
