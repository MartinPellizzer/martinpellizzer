                    <h1>Melasma luridum</h1>
<p>Melasma luridum, commonly known as the lurid bane, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow under moonlight.</p>
<p>Native to the dense, humid jungles of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biological properties, it is studied for potential medicinal applications in bioluminescence research.</p>
