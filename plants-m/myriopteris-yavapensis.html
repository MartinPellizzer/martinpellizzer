<p>Myriopteris yavapensis, commonly known as Yavapai shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Myriopteris yavapensis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
