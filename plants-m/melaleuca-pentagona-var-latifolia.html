                    <h1>Melaleuca pentagona var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca pentagona var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in diverse environmental conditions.</p>
