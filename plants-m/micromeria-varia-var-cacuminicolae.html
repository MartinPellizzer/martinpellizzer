                    <h1>Micromeria varia var. cacuminicolae</h1>
<p>Micromeria varia var. cacuminicolae, commonly known as the coastal micromeria, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, glandular leaves that are adapted to thrive in arid and coastal environments. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
