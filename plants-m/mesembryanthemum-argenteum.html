                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum argenteum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum argenteum, commonly known as silver mesem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
