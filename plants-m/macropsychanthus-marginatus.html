<p>Macropsychanthus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate macropsychanthus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny, and often branched stems, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, typically appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
