<p>Mycetanthe zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Mycetanthe zippelii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures.</p>
