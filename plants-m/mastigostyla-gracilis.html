                    <h1>Mastigostyla gracilis</h1>
<p>Mastigostyla gracilis, commonly known as the slender hornwort, is a type of freshwater algae belonging to the order Charales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with long, branching filaments that bear small, spirally arranged cells. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found attached to submerged surfaces such as rocks or aquatic plants. Mastigostyla gracilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and reproductive structures are typical of its classification within the Charales.</p>
