                    <h1>Mentha pulegium var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium var. gigantea, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are also covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
