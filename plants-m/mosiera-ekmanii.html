<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Mosiera ekmanii thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
