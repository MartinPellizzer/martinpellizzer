                    <h1>Mimosa pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Mimosa pulcherrima, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and light makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
