<p>Mystacorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, delicate white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Mystacorchis is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
