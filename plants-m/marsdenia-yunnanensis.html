<p>Marsdenia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Marsdenia, is a flowering plant native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and fleshy, often hairy stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive corona structure. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid or semi-arid environment.</p>
<p>Marsdenia yunnanensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional uses in Chinese medicine.</p>
