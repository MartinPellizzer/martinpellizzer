<p>Maxillaria ctenostachys, commonly known as the feathered maxillaria, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features long, slender sepals and petals that give it a feathery appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Maxillaria ctenostachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a greenhouse or indoor setting.</p>
