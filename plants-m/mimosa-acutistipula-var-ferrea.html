                    <h1>Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea</h1>
<p>Mimosa acutistipula var. ferrea, commonly known as the ironwood mimosa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
