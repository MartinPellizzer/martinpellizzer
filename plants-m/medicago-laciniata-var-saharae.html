<p>Medicago laciniata var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan clover, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in semi-arid regions.</p>
