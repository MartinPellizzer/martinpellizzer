                    <h1>Mammillaria guerreronis var. zapilotensis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria guerreronis var. zapilotensis, commonly known as the Zapilotan mammillaria, is a compact cactus species native to the Mexican state of Guanajuato.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, white to pale yellow areoles, from which arise clusters of white, silky bristles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
