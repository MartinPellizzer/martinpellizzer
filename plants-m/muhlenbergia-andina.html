<p>Muhlenbergia andina, commonly known as Andean muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Muhlenbergia andina is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates.</p>
