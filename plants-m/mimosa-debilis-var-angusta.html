                    <h1>Mimosa debilis var. angusta</h1>
<p>Mimosa debilis var. angusta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sensitive plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The leaves are bipinnately compound, with numerous small, feather-like leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by flattened, bean-like pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
