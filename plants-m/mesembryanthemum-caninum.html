                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum caninum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum caninum, commonly known as the dog's tooth flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a response to light and temperature changes. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
