                    <h1>Mikania cumingii</h1>
<p>Mikania cumingii, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and hairy. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in clusters. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>Mikania cumingii is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
