<p>Mariscus sumatrensis var. subcompositus, commonly known as the Sumatran marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the wetlands of Sumatra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
