<p>Myrtoleucodendron globiferum, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, globe-shaped inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
