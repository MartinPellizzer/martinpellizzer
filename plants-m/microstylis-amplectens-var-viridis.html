<p>Microstylis amplectens var. viridis, commonly known as the green microstylis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and slender, greenish-yellow inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming briefly before withering, which makes it a challenging species to study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
