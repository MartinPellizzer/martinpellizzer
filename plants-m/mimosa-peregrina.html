                    <h1>Mimosa peregrina</h1>
<p>Mimosa peregrina, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational settings.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and public engagement.</p>
