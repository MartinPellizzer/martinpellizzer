                    <h1>Musa × paradisiaca var. dorsata</h1>
<p>Musa × paradisiaca var. dorsata, commonly known as the dessert banana, is a variety of the banana plant characterized by its large, elongated fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is a herbaceous perennial, with a pseudostem formed by the tightly packed leaf sheaths. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are typically clustered in a central inflorescence, with the female flowers developing into the edible fruit.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its sweet, creamy texture and is widely cultivated for both commercial and home use.</p>
