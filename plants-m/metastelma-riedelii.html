<p>Metastelma riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host trees for nutrients and water, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
