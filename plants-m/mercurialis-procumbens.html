                    <h1>Mercurialis procumbens</h1>
<p>Mercurialis procumbens, commonly known as the creeping mercury or sticky nightshade, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with hairy surfaces and often have a sticky texture due to the presence of glandular trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both animals and humans if ingested.</p>
