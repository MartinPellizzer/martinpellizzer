                    <h1>Miconia jucunda</h1>
<p>Miconia jucunda, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that are often followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for native ecosystems.</p>
