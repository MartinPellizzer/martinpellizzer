                    <h1>Meristostigma junceum</h1>
<p>Meristostigma junceum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with whorled leaves that are often narrow and linear. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Meristostigma junceum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on ancient plant lineages and ecological adaptations.</p>
