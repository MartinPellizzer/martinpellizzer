<p>Malus domestica subsp.</p>
<p>hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid apple, is a subspecies of the domesticated apple that results from crossbreeding between different apple species. It exhibits a wide range of fruit characteristics, including varying sizes, colors, and flavors, making it highly adaptable for both commercial and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The plant typically has a deciduous habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which give way to the edible fruits in the fall.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is widely used in apple breeding programs to develop new cultivars with improved traits.</p>
