                    <h1>Miconia dimorpha</h1>
<p>Miconia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form miconia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain ecosystems.</p>
