                            <h1>Mentha Insularis Subsp. Cinereovirens</h1>
<p>Island mint, scientifically known as Mentha insularis subsp. cinereovirens, is a rare and elusive plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. This subspecies of mint is distinguished by its delicate silver-green leaves and aromatic, cooling scent that lingers in the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing near rocky outcrops or along the edges of forested areas. Despite its beauty, Island mint is critically endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique plant and preserve its ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>
