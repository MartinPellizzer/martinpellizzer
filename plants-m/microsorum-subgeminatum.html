<p>Microsorum subgeminatum, commonly known as the twin-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in pairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its floating leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum subgeminatum is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>
