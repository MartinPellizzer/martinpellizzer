<p>Minuartiella dianthifolia subsp.</p>
<p>cataonica, commonly known as the Cataonic rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and alpine regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
