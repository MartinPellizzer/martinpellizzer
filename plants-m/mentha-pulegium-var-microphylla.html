                    <h1>Mentha pulegium var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Mentha pulegium var. microphylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of pulegone, a volatile compound. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has square stems with opposite leaves. It produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its potent essential oils, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine but requires caution due to its potential toxicity.</p>
