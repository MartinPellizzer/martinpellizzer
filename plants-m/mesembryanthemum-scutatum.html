                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum scutatum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum scutatum, commonly known as the "Cape gooseberry" or "Oxalis," is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum scutatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
