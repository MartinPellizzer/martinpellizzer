<p>Macropodanthus alatus, commonly known as the winged sandverbena, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Macropodanthus alatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
