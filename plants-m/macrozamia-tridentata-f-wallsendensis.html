                    <h1>Macrozamia tridentata f. wallsendensis</h1>
<p>Macrozamia tridentata f. wallsendensis, commonly known as the Wallsend cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
