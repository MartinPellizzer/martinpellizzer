                    <h1>Mastigostyla major</h1>
<p>Mastigostyla major, commonly known as the giant sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It possesses a large, umbrella-shaped body called a cnidarium, which is surrounded by numerous tentacles. These tentacles are equipped with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which are used for capturing prey. The plant-like structure of Mastigostyla major is supported by a flexible mesogloea, allowing it to sway with ocean currents.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant as it provides habitat for various small marine organisms.</p>
