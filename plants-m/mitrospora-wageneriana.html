                    <h1>Mitrospora wageneriana</h1>
<p>Mitrospora wageneriana, commonly known as the black root rot fungus, is a soilborne pathogen that primarily affects the roots of various plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sphaeropsidaceae and is characterized by its dark, powdery spore masses that develop on infected plant tissues. The fungus thrives in cool, moist conditions and can persist in the soil for several years, making it a persistent threat to agricultural crops. It causes necrosis and decay in root systems, leading to reduced plant growth and yield loss.</p>
<p>Management typically involves crop rotation, soil amendments, and the use of resistant varieties.</p>
