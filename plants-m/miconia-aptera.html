<p>Miconia aptera, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits.
