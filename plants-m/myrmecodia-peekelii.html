                    <h1>Myrmecodia peekelii</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia peekelii, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, honeycomb-like stems that provide shelter for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with ants, which contribute to its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Native to Southeast Asia, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest.</p>
