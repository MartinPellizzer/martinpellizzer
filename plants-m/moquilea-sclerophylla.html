                    <h1>Moquilea sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Moquilea sclerophylla, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Moquilea sclerophylla is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
