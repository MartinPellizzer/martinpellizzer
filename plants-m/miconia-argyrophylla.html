                    <h1>Miconia argyrophylla</h1>
<p>Miconia argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions.</p>
