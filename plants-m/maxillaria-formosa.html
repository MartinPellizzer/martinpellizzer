<p>Maxillaria formosa, commonly known as the showy maxillaria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
