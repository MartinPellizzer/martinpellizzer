                    <h1>Macroptilium ekmanianum</h1>
<p>Macroptilium ekmanianum, commonly known as the Ekman's burr legume, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological restoration.</p>
