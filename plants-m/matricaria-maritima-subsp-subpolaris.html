<p>Matricaria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>subpolaris, commonly known as polar groundcherry, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of chamomile, and it is adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and has a short growing season, typical of polar environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in tundra and coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
