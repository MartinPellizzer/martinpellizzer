                    <h1>Monotropsis odorata var. lehmaniae</h1>
<p>Monotropsis odorata var. lehmaniae, commonly known as the Lehman's Indian pipe, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically clustered at the base of its stem. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed habitats.</p>
