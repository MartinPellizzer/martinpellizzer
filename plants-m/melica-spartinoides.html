                    <h1>Melica spartinoides</h1>
<p>Melica spartinoides, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often grow in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Melica spartinoides thrives in maritime environments, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for specialized wildlife.</p>
