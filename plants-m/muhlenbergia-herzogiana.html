                    <h1>Muhlenbergia herzogiana</h1>
<p>Muhlenbergia herzogiana, commonly known as the desert muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton, adding a distinctive visual element to its appearance. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
