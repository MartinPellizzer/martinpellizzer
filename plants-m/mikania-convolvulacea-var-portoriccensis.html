<p>Mikania convolvulacea var. portoriccensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
