<p>Mimosa velloziana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mimosa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by the plant's sensitivity to touch. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique characteristics, it is often grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
