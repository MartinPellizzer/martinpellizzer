<p>Myricaria dahurica subsp.</p>
<p>squamosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-silver leaves covered in dense, scale-like hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
