                    <h1>Mirandorchis</h1>
<p>Mirandorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, leafless stem and produces its flowers directly from the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Mirandorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
