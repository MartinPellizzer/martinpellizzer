<p>Mimosopsis desmanthocarpa, commonly known as the desert mimosopsis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant has small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are compound and adapted to reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Mimosopsis desmanthocarpa is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
