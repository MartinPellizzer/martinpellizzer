                    <h1>Mollugo suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Mollugo suffruticosa, commonly known as beach sandpenny, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has fleshy, oblong leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, sandy habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow and adapted to stabilize loose sand, making it an important pioneer species in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mollugo suffruticosa is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, contributing to its ecological resilience.</p>
