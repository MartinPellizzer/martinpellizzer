                    <h1>Manfreda singuliflora</h1>
<p>Manfreda singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower manfreda, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting to its drought-prone environment. The plant produces a single, striking violet or purple flower on a tall, slender stem during the spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
