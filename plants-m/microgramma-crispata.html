                    <h1>Microgramma crispata</h1>
<p>Microgramma crispata, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Microgramma crispata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.</p>
