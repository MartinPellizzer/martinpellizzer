<p>Microlicia juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-like mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
