                    <h1>Melientha</h1>
<p>Melientha, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. The plant has a distinctive prop root system that allows it to stabilize itself in muddy or tidal soils. Melientha is often found in brackish water areas and plays a role in coastal ecosystem stabilization.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its distribution along shorelines.</p>
