                    <h1>Manihot bahiensis var. microsperma</h1>
<p>Manihot bahiensis var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded cassava, is a variant of the cassava plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more numerous seeds compared to other cassava varieties. The plant produces edible roots that are rich in carbohydrates but contain toxic compounds that must be processed before consumption. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving cassava resilience and yield.</p>
