                    <h1>Maerua hoehnelii</h1>
<p>Maerua hoehnelii, commonly known as the Hoehnel's maerua, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, often spine-tipped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Maerua hoehnelii plays a minor but important part in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range.</p>
