<p>Marsilea apposita, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble clover leaves, which are typically four-lobed and arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which contribute to its reproductive cycle. Marsilea apposita is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
