                    <h1>Mimosa divergens</h1>
<p>Mimosa divergens, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Mimosa divergens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
