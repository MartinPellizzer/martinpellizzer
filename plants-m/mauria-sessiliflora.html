                    <h1>Mauria sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Mauria sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.</p>
