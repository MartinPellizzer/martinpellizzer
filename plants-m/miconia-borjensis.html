<p>Miconia borjensis, commonly known as the Borj√©'s miconia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, violet-pink bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or tree in humid, shaded forest environments. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
