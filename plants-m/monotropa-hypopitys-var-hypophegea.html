                    <h1>Monotropa hypopitys var. hypophegea</h1>
<p>Monotropa hypopitys var. hypophegea, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Its structure consists of a single stem with a cluster of leaves at the base and a terminal inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its pale coloration and ghostly appearance, it is often referred to as a "ghost plant.".</p>
