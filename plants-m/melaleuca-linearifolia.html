                    <h1>Melaleuca linearifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of melaleuca native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically white or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a greyish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>Melaleuca linearifolia is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
