                    <h1>Mycopteris leucolepis</h1>
<p>Mycopteris leucolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive silvery sheen on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense, mat-like clusters on rocky or shaded soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
