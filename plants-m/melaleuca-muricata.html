<p>Melaleuca muricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved paperbark, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Melaleuca muricata is typically found in wetlands and along watercourses, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
