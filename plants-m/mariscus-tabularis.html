                    <h1>Mariscus tabularis</h1>
<p>Mariscus tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf mariscus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Mariscus tabularis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
