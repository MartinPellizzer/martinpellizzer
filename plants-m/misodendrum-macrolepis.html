                    <h1>Misodendrum macrolepis</h1>
<p>Misodendrum macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
