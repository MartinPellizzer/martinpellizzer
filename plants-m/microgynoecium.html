                    <h1>Microgynoecium</h1>
<p>Microgynoecium, commonly known as the female reproductive structure in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It consists of one or more carpels that fuse to form a single chamber called the gynoecium. The microgynoecium typically contains the ovary, which houses the ovules that develop into seeds. This structure is characteristic of plants in the order Malvales, such as cotton and hibiscus.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in sexual reproduction and seed production.</p>
