                    <h1>Myrodia longiflora</h1>
<p>Myrodia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered myrtle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Myrodia longiflora is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
