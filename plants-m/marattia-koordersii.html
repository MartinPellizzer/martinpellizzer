                    <h1>Marattia koordersii</h1>
<p>Marattia koordersii, commonly known as the Koorders' water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns.</p>
<p>Marattia koordersii is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns.</p>
