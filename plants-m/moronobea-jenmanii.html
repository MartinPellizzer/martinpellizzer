                    <h1>Moronobea jenmanii</h1>
<p>Moronobea jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's moronobea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent central stigma, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Moronobea jenmanii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
