                    <h1>Marianthemum betonicifolium</h1>
<p>Marianthemum betonicifolium, commonly known as the betony-leaved moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves.
