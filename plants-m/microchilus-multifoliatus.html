<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its foliage is often densely packed, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
