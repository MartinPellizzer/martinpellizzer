                    <h1>Melia azedarach var. umbraculiformis</h1>
<p>Melia azedarach var. umbraculiformis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood or umbra tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of compound leaves, which provide shade and contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by woody, spiky fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and shade-providing qualities.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of wood.</p>
