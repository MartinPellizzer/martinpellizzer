<p>Monstera tuberculata var. brevinoda, commonly known as the dwarf monstera, is a tropical vine native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more rounded compared to the larger, split leaves of its more common relatives. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, green berries that mature to a reddish hue. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets.</p>
