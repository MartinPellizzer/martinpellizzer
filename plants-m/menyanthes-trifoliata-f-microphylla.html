                    <h1>Menyanthes trifoliata f. microphylla</h1>
<p>Menyanthes trifoliata f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf water-leaf, is a rare and compact variant of the water-leaf plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in the margins of ponds or along streams. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and white, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
