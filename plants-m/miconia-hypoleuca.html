                    <h1>Miconia hypoleuca</h1>
<p>Miconia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-veined miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by ornamental fruits that are round and fleshy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions.</p>
