                    <h1>Maerua maschonica</h1>
<p>Maerua maschonica, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits containing hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The wood of Maerua maschonica is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making in local communities.</p>
