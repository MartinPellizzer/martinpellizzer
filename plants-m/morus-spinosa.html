The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as mulberries, which are typically green when immature and turn dark purple or black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>Morus spinosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance.</p>
