                    <h1>Malus britannica</h1>
<p>Malus britannica, commonly known as the British apple tree, is a species native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, round fruits known as apples. These apples are generally small, tart, and have a high acidity, making them suitable for cooking rather than eating raw.</p>
<p>Malus britannica plays an important role in the ecological and historical landscape of the UK.</p>
