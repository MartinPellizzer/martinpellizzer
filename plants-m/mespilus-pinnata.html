                    <h1>Mespilus pinnata</h1>
<p>Mespilus pinnata, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by fruit that ripens in the autumn. The fruit, known as a medlar, is typically harvested when it is partially decayed, a process called "mummification.".</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature contributes to its historical and culinary significance.</p>
