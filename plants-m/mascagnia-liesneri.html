<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
