                    <h1>Malvastrum scoparioides</h1>
<p>Malvastrum scoparioides, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and lobed, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, and it is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Malvastrum scoparioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
