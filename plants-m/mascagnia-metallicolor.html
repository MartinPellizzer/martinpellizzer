The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in arid climates.</p>
