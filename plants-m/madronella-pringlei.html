<p>Madronella pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's madrone, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, and its broad, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
