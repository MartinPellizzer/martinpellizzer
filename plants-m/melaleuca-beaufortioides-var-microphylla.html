                    <h1>Melaleuca beaufortioides var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Melaleuca beaufortioides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flower spikes that are often pink or red in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
