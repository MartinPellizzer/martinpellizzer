                    <h1>Mespilus esquirolii</h1>
<p>Mespilus esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's whitebeam, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like roses and apples. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It is typically found in rocky or forested habitats and is considered a relict species due to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Mespilus esquirolii is now classified as endangered.</p>
