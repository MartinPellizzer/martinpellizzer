                    <h1>Malleola insectifera</h1>
<p>Malleola insectifera, commonly known as the insect-bearing malleola, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant's unique feature is its ability to attract and harbor various insects, which may play a role in its pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Malleola insectifera is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
