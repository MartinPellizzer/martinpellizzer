<p>Miconia selleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. Miconia selleana is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
