                    <h1>Myrmechis pumila</h1>
<p>Myrmechis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a primary and secondary host, with the secondary host being a different plant species. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustellum, a specialized structure that attaches to the host.</p>
<p>Myrmechis pumila plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, influencing the growth and distribution of its host trees.</p>
