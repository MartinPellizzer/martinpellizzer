                    <h1>Mediocalcar albicoccineum</h1>
<p>Mediocalcar albicoccineum, commonly known as the white-stemmed rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with slender, pale green stems that often appear almost translucent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
