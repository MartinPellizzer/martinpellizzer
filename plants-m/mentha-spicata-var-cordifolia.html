                    <h1>Mentha spicata var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Mentha spicata var. cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf mint, is a variant of the spearmint species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically larger and more rounded than those of the standard spearmint. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in culinary applications and herbal remedies due to its aromatic properties and mild menthol scent.</p>
