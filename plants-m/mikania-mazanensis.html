<p>Mikania mazanensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining.</p>
<p>Mikania mazanensis is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
