                    <h1>Molineria oligantha</h1>
<p>Molineria oligantha, commonly known as the slender false orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
