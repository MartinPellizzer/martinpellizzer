<p>Mespilus maxima, commonly known as the giant medlar, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically harvested in the autumn, though they are often used in jams and preserves due to their unique flavor. Mespilus maxima is known for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements.</p>
