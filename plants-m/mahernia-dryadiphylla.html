<p>Mahernia dryadiphylla, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and unique plant found in specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unusual, tree-like appearance with a trunk that resembles a skeleton, giving it its common name. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, pale flowers that bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Mahernia dryadiphylla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
