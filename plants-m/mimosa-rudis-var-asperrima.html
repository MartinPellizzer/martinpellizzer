                    <h1>Mimosa rudis var. asperrima</h1>
<p>Mimosa rudis var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough mimosa, is a variant of the mimosa plant characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaflets and thorny stems.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species.</p>
<p>This variation is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
