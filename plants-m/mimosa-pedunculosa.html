                    <h1>Mimosa pedunculosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa pedunculosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
<p>Mimosa pedunculosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
