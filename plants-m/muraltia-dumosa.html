                    <h1>Muraltia dumosa</h1>
<p>Muraltia dumosa, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Muraltia dumosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
