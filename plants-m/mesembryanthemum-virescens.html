<p>Mesembryanthemum virescens, commonly known as the green ice plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum virescens is also known for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common ornamental and drought-tolerant ground cover.</p>
