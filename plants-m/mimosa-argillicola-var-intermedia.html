                    <h1>Mimosa argillicola var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Mimosa argillicola var. intermedia, commonly known as the clay mimosa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
