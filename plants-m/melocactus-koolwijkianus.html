                    <h1>Melocactus koolwijkianus</h1>
<p>Melocactus koolwijkianus, commonly known as the Koolwijk's melon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, columnar stem covered in dense, white spines and a distinctive, rounded crown that resembles a melon. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections.</p>
