<p>Mimosa alba, commonly known as the white sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Mimosa alba is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
