<p>Myosotis oenesia, commonly known as the Antarctic forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in harsh, icy environments with limited sunlight. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Myosotis oenesia is adapted to extreme conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience to cold and wind.</p>
