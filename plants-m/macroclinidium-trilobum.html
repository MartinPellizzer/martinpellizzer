<p>Macroclinidium trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant's structure consists of a yellow or reddish stem with clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in shades of yellow or green.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
