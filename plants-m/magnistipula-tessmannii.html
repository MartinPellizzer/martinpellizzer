                    <h1>Magnistipula tessmannii</h1>
<p>Magnistipula tessmannii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the eastern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily from the genus *Africanum*, and derives some of its nutrients through a specialized root system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can indicate the health of its host trees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
