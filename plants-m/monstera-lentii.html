<p>Monstera lentii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Monstera lentii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
