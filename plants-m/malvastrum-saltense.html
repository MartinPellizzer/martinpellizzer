                    <h1>Malvastrum saltense</h1>
<p>Malvastrum saltense, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, usually pink or purple, five-petaled flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in saline and drought-prone soils. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Malvastrum saltense plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
