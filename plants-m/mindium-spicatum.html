                    <h1>Mindium spicatum</h1>
<p>Mindium spicatum, commonly known as the spike moss, is a type of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures arranged in spirals around the stems, which are often mistaken for true leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Mindium spicatum produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
