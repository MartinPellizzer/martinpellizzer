                    <h1>Malaxis wariana var. oreogena</h1>
<p>Malaxis wariana var. oreogena, commonly known as the mountain malaxis, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, hairy leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. It is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine forests, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
