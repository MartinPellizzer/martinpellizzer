<p>Muhlenbergia frondosa, commonly known as the silky muhlenbergia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it an excellent ground cover in dry, sandy environments.</p>
