                    <h1>Mackenziea integrifolia</h1>
<p>Mackenziea integrifolia, commonly known as the Mackenzie's hakea, is a shrub native to the western regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom during the warmer months, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Mackenziea integrifolia is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
