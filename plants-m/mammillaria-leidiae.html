<p>Mammillaria leidiae, commonly known as the Leidia's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
