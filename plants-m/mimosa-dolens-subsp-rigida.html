<p>Mimosa dolens subsp.</p>
<p>rigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, causing them to fold shutâ€”a trait known as thigmonastic response.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is appreciated in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>
