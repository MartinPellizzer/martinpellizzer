                            <h1>Mitreola Lanceolata</h1>
<p>Mitreola lanceolata is a small, delicate flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family and is known for its unique, lantern-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its modest size, this plant holds cultural and medicinal significance in many regions. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss, Mitreola lanceolata is becoming increasingly rare and is now classified as endangered in several areas.</p>
