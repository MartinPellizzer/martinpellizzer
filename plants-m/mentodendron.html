                    <h1>Mentodendron</h1>
<p>Mentodendron, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and is characterized by its deciduous, often thorny shrubs or small trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Mentodendron species are valued for their hard, aromatic wood, which has been used historically in construction and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
