<p>Monoculus hyoseroides, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet soils, it is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in pond margins.</p>
