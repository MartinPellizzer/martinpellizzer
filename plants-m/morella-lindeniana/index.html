                            <h1>Morella Lindeniana</h1>
<p>Morella lindeniana, also known as the coastal wax myrtle, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wet, sandy soils along coastal areas and is often found in tidal marshes and swamps. This plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to withstand salt spray and flooding. Its small, wax-coated berries provide food for various wildlife species. Morella lindeniana plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
