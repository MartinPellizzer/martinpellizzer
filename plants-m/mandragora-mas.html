                    <h1>Mandragora mas</h1>
<p>Mandragora mas, commonly known as the European mandrake, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, human-shaped root system. The plant produces violet flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. Its leaves are lobed and have a strong, often unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine and folklore, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxicity.</p>
