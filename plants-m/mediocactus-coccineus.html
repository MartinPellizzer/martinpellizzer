<p>Mediocactus coccineus, commonly known as the red columnar cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
