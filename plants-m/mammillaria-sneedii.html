                    <h1>Mammillaria sneedii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria sneedii, commonly known as the Sneed's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the United States, specifically found in Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Mammillaria sneedii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
