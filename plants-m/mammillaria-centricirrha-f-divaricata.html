<p>Mammillaria centricirrha f. divaricata, commonly known as the branched mammillaria, is a compact cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of Mexico, where it thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. The plant features small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a potted plant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
