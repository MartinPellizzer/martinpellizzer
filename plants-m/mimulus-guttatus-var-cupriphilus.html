                    <h1>Mimulus guttatus var. cupriphilus</h1>
<p>Mimulus guttatus var. cupriphilus, commonly known as the copper-loving yellow monkeyflower, is a variant of the yellow monkeyflower native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in areas with high copper content, which it can tolerate and even thrive on. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations.</p>
