<p>Mimosa setosa subsp.</p>
<p>urbica, commonly known as the urban mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and showy, pinkish-white flower clusters.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments such as sidewalks and vacant lots.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its sensitivity to touch, as the leaves fold shut when disturbed, a trait shared with other mimosa species.</p>
