                    <h1>Mastrucium</h1>
<p>Mastrucium, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and its showy purple flowers bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native plants for sunlight and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, Mastrucium is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>
