<p>Marsilea crenulata, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial stages. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Marsilea crenulata is often used in water gardens and is also an indicator species for water quality.</p>
