<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather.</p>
