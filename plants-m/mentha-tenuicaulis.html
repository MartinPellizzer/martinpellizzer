<p>Mentha tenuicaulis, commonly known as slender catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Mentha tenuicaulis is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae), sharing some aromatic properties with other mints, though it is less commonly used in culinary or medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
