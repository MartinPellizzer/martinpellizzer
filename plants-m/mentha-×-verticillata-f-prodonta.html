<p>Mentha × verticillata f. prodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mint, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which contribute to its ornamental value. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of menthol and other essential oils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for its cooling and digestive properties.</p>
