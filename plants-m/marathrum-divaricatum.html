                    <h1>Marathrum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Marathrum divaricatum, commonly known as the silverleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive and can help prevent soil erosion in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Marathrum divaricatum is adapted to thrive in full sun and is often found in desert scrub and riparian habitats.</p>
