<p>Mammillaria busonii, commonly known as the Busoni's hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts.</p>
