                    <h1>Medusorchis holotricha</h1>
<p>Medusorchis holotricha, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals and sepals that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, hairy spur. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medusorchis holotricha is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
