                    <h1>Malocchia gladiata</h1>
<p>Malocchia gladiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps the plant attract pollinators in low-light conditions.</p>
