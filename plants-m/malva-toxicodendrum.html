<p>Malva toxicodendrum, commonly known as the toxic wood mallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
