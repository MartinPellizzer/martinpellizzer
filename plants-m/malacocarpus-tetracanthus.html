                    <h1>Malacocarpus tetracanthus</h1>
<p>Malacocarpus tetracanthus, commonly known as the four-armed sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anthophyceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of flexible, fleshy polyps. The coral's skeletal framework is made of calcareous material, which provides structural support while allowing for growth in dynamic underwater conditions. Its polyps are typically small and feature tentacles used for capturing plankton, which serves as its primary food source.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in coral reef ecosystems by contributing to habitat complexity and biodiversity.</p>
