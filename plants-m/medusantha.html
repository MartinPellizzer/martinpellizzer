                    <h1>Medusantha</h1>
<p>Medusantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, ghostly white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Medusantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
