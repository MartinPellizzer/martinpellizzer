<p>Melanthium monoicum, commonly known as the single-stem milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features a single, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Melanthium monoicum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
