                    <h1>Marsilea microcarpa</h1>
<p>Marsilea microcarpa, commonly known as water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like appearance, with tiny, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sporocarps that are often found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Marsilea microcarpa is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
