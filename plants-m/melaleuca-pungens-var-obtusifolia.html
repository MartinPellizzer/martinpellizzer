                    <h1>Melaleuca pungens var. obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca pungens var. obtusifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It produces small, bottle-shaped flowers in clusters, typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests.</p>
