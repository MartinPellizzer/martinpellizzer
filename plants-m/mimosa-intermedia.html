                    <h1>Mimosa intermedia</h1>
<p>Mimosa intermedia, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf movements and rapid response to touch make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
