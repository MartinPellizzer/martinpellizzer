                    <h1>Mimosa nuttallii</h1>
<p>Mimosa nuttallii, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and rapid leaf movement make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
