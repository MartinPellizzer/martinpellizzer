<p>Medicago minima subvar. elongata, commonly known as the slender goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive blue-green color, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
