<p>Melampodium paludicola, commonly known as swamp sunflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant has a creeping stem that often forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in wet environments. Its flowers bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Melampodium paludicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
