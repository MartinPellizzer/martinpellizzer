<p>Miconia trianae, commonly known as the red miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are highly ornamental.
