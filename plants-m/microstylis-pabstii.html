                    <h1>Microstylis pabstii</h1>
<p>Microstylis pabstii, commonly known as the Pabst's microstylis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its small, delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of grasses, and it produces small, wind-pollinated blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
