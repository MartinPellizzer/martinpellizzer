                    <h1>Mespilus pygmaea</h1>
<p>Mespilus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf medlar, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The fruit, which is a pome, matures in the autumn and is known for its unique, aromatic qualities. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and seasonal interest.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely used for fruit production due to its short shelf life and specific ripening requirements.</p>
