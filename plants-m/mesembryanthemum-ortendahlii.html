                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum ortendahlii</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum ortendahlii, commonly known as the Namib Desert ice plant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its root system is shallow, enabling it to absorb moisture from the surface quickly.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum ortendahlii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a hardy species in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
