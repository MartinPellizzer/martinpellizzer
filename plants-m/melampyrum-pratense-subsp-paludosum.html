<p>Melampyrum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>paludosum, commonly known as marsh touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and fens, and is often found in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive nutrients from its host plants, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
