                    <h1>Malaxis umbellulata</h1>
<p>Malaxis umbellulata, commonly known as the umbellate malaxis, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel-like cluster. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its flowers are often pollinated by small insects, and it is considered a rare and specialized orchid.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Malaxis umbellulata is threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
