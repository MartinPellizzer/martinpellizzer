<p>Mollugo flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific island environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist, sandy soils and often thrives in coastal or inland dune habitats. Its unique morphology includes specialized structures that aid in water retention, which is crucial for survival in its often arid or saline environment.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
