                    <h1>Madhuca montana</h1>
<p>Madhuca montana, commonly known as the hill mahua, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to local biodiversity.</p>
