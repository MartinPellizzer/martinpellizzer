                    <h1>Melampyrum subalpinum f. setaceum</h1>
<p>Melampyrum subalpinum f. setaceum, commonly known as the alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often in open, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's fleshy roots and specialized structures enable it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
