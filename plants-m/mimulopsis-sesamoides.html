<p>Mimulopsis sesamoides, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Mimulopsis sesamoides is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
