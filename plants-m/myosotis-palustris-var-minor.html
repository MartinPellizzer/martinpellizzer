                    <h1>Myosotis palustris var. minor</h1>
<p>Myosotis palustris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are usually submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and preference for wet conditions make it a characteristic species of wetland flora.</p>
