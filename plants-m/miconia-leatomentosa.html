                    <h1>Miconia leatomentosa</h1>
<p>Miconia leatomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
