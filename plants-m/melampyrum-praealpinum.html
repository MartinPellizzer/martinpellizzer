<p>Melampyrum praealpinum, commonly known as the alpine touch-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It is native to mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in open, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
