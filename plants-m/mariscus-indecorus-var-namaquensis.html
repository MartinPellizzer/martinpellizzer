                    <h1>Mariscus indecorus var. namaquensis</h1>
<p>Mariscus indecorus var. namaquensis, commonly known as the Namakwa marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in wetland and marsh environments, where it forms dense mats near water's edge. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptation to seasonal flooding and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
