<p>Melinis repens subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed.</p>
