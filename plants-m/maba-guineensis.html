<p>Maba guineensis, commonly known as African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that give way to round, woody fruits containing a nutritious seed kernel. The seed kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products.</p>
