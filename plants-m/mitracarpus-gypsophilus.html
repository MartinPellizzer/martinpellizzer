                    <h1>Mitracarpus gypsophilus</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus gypsophilus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Mitracarpus gypsophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying desert flora.</p>
