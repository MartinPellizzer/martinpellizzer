<p>Mimosa strigillosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response mediated by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique movement and delicate appearance make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
