                    <h1>Mallea</h1>
<p>Mallea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody, often twisted stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Mallea species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, many species of Mallea are now classified as threatened or endangered.</p>
