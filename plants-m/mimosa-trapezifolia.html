                    <h1>Mimosa trapezifolia</h1>
<p>Mimosa trapezifolia, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa trapezifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate appearance.</p>
