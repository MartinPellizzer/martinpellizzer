                    <h1>Microcharis garissaensis</h1>
<p>Microcharis garissaensis, commonly known as the Garissa false hellebore, is a flowering plant native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense vegetation. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
