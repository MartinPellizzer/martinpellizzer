                    <h1>Mentzelia sessilifolia</h1>
<p>Mentzelia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, sessile (stemless) leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Mentzelia sessilifolia is an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
