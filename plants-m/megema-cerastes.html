                    <h1>Megema cerastes</h1>
<p>Megema cerastes, commonly known as the desert horned lily, is a striking plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its most notable characteristic is the presence of horn-like projections along the stem, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
