                    <h1>Melica ciliata var. parlatorei</h1>
<p>Melica ciliata var. parlatorei, commonly known as the silky meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive silvery sheen along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments.</p>
