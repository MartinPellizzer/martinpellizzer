<p>Malvastrum bicuspidatum is a flowering plant native to the southwestern united states and northern mexico. it belongs to the malliaceae family and is known for its distinctive two-lobed flowers. this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along roadsides. its common name, "two-lobed mallow," refers to the unique shape of its petals. it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
