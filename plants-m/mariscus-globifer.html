<p>It features a compact, rounded growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fibrous roots and rhizomes, allowing it to thrive in saturated soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, growing in a rosette pattern at the base.</p>
<p>Mariscus globifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
