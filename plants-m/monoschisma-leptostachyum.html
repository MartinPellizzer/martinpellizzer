<p>Monoschisma leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed monoschisma, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
