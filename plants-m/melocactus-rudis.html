                    <h1>Melocactus rudis</h1>
<p>Melocactus rudis, commonly known as the stone cactus or the rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, columnar stem that is often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, large, spiny areole that bears a few white, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stem during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Melocactus rudis is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
