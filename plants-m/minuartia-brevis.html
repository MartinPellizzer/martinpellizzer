<p>Minuartia brevis, commonly known as the shortleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
