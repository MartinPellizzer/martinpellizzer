                    <h1>Mammillaria deliusiana</h1>
<p>Mammillaria deliusiana, commonly known as the Deliusiana Pincushion Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
