                    <h1>Malabaila echinulata</h1>
<p>Malabaila echinulata, commonly known as the spiny rock cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Malabaila echinulata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
