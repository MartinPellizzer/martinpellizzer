<p>Microchilus loxoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. The plant features a compact, mat-like growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized environment, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
