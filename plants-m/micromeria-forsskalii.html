                    <h1>Micromeria forsskalii</h1>
<p>Micromeria forsskalii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pink or purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Micromeria forsskalii is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
