<p>Macrosolen subumbellatus, commonly known as the giant umbrella fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with aerial roots that help it climb and anchor to trees or other structures. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
