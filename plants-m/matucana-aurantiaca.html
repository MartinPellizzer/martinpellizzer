<p>Matucana aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by the development of red or orange fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Matucana aurantiaca is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
