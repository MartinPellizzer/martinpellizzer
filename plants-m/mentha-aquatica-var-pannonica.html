<p>Mentha aquatica var. pannonica, commonly known as Hungarian water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves with a strong minty scent and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent colonizer of wet habitats.</p>
