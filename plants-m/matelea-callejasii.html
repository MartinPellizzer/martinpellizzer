<p>Matelea callejasii, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, nocturnal blooms. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
