<p>Miconia filamentosa subsp.</p>
<p>caquetana, commonly known as the Caquet√° miconia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, orange-red berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an important component of the understory in humid tropical forests.</p>
