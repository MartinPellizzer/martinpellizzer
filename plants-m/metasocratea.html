                    <h1>Metasocratea</h1>
<p>Metasocratea, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Metasocratea plays a vital role in filtering pollutants and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
