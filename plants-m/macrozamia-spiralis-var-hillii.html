                    <h1>Macrozamia spiralis var. hillii</h1>
<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires a subtropical to warm temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
