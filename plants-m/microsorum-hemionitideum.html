                    <h1>Microsorum hemionitideum</h1>
<p>Microsorum hemionitideum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive golden or yellowish hue along the midrib. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Microsorum hemionitideum is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water.</p>
