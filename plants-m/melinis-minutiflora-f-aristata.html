                    <h1>Melinis minutiflora f. aristata</h1>
<p>Melinis minutiflora f. aristata, commonly known as the aristate carpetgrass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on short, upright spikes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
