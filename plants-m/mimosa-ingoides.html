                    <h1>Mimosa ingoides</h1>
<p>Mimosa ingoides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Mimosa ingoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
