                    <h1>Melocactus longicarpus</h1>
<p>Melocactus longicarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking, red to orange spiny fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its dense, spiny appearance helps it survive in harsh, dry environments by reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Melocactus longicarpus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
