                    <h1>Meriolix spinulosa</h1>
<p>Meriolix spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny scalebug, is a small, armored insect that belongs to the order Hemiptera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a waxy, protective exoskeleton. The plant it inhabits is typically a shrub or tree with rough, bark-like surfaces that provide suitable habitat for the insect. Meriolix spinulosa feeds on plant sap, using its specialized mouthparts to extract nutrients from the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic appearance and specialized habitat, it is often overlooked in botanical studies.</p>
