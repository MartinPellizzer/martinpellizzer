<p>Minuartia verna subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, growing at high altitudes where temperatures are cool.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
