<p>Mimosa pseudincana, commonly known as the golden mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and unique leaf movement make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
