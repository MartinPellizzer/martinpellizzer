<p>Menonvillea filifolia subsp.</p>
<p>marticorenae, commonly known as the Marticorenae's leafy menonvillea, is a rare bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
