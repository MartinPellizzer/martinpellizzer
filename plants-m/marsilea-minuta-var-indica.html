<p>Marsilea minuta var. indica, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that are typically less than 1 cm in size. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ornamental ponds and as a water purifier due to its ability to absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
