<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live offspring through the production of seedlings on its stems.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a well-drained soil environment.</p>
