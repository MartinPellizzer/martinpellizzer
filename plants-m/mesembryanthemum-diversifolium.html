<p>Mesembryanthemum diversifolium, commonly known as the Variable Leaf Ice Plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually lobed or divided, showing significant variation in shape and size, which contributes to its common name.</p>
