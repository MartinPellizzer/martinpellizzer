                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum spinosum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny carpetweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or yellow, blooming during the cooler morning hours. It is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>
