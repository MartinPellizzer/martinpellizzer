<p>Mollia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading mossy plant, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Mollia diffusa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
