<p>Mormolyca sotoana, commonly known as the Sotoan ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mormolyca sotoana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
