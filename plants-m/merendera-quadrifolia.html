<p>Merendera quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and the symbolism of its four leaves, it is highly valued in folklore and botany.</p>
