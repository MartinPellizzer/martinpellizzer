<p>Maerua arabica, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, dry fruits containing seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Maerua arabica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
