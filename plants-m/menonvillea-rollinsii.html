<p>Menonvillea rollinsii, commonly known as the RÃ­o Blanco bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the highlands of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow rosette of dark green, strap-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red bracts that enclose its showy, tubular flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts.</p>
