                    <h1>Miconia ravenii</h1>
<p>Miconia ravenii, commonly known as the black miconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Miconia ravenii is also notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
