                    <h1>Myroxylon balsamum</h1>
<p>Myroxylon balsamum, commonly known as the wild balsam or Brazil wood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its rich color and durability. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. Its bark and wood contain a resinous substance that has been historically used in the production of dyes and varnishes.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
