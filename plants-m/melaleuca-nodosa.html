                    <h1>Melaleuca nodosa</h1>
<p>Melaleuca nodosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green, white, and brown beneath. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca nodosa is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
