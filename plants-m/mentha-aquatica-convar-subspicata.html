<p>Mentha aquatica convar. subspicata, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near streams or ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, aromatic stems that are often square in cross-section, a characteristic common to the mint family. Its lance-shaped leaves are usually hairy and have a strong, refreshing menthol scent.</p>
<p>Small, pale blue or violet flowers appear in whorls along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value and attracting pollinators.</p>
