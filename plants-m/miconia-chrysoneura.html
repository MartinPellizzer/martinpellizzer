<p>Miconia chrysoneura, commonly known as the goldenleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
