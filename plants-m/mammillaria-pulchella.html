<p>Mammillaria pulchella, commonly known as the Snowball Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, woolly spines and small, pale green stems that often appear rounded or bulbous. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor collections.</p>
