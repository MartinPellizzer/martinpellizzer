<p>Myriophyllum rubricaule, commonly known as redstem watermilfoil, is an aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often red-tinged, especially when submerged. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Its small, green flowers appear in dense clusters and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Myriophyllum rubricaule is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense underwater mats.</p>
