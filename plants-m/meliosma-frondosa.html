<p>Meliosma frondosa, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
