                    <h1>Malaxis exilis</h1>
<p>Malaxis exilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
