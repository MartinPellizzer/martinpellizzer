<p>Melocactus intortus subsp.</p>
<p>broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway melocactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the dry, rocky regions of western Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stem and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted green color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem and thriving with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
