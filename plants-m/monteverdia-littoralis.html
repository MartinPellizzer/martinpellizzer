                    <h1>Monteverdia littoralis</h1>
<p>Monteverdia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal monteverdia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, saline environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are adapted to stabilize loose soil and prevent erosion along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Monteverdia littoralis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
