                    <h1>Mimosa capillipes var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Mimosa capillipes var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sensitive plant, is a variant of the mimosa species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
