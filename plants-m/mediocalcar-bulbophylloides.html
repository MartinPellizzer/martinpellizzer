                    <h1>Mediocalcar bulbophylloides</h1>
<p>Mediocalcar bulbophylloides, commonly known as the bulbous rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like underground stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mediocalcar bulbophylloides is adapted to rocky habitats and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes.</p>
