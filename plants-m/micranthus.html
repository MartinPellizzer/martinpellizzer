                    <h1>Micranthus</h1>
<p>Micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers. Micranthus species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are sometimes used in ornamental gardening. They produce grass-like leaves and have inflorescences that can be either spike-like or panicle-shaped.</p>
<p>Due to their resilience and adaptability, some species of Micranthus are also used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
