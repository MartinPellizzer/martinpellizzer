                    <h1>Maasia glauca</h1>
<p>Maasia glauca, commonly known as the blue-green moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It forms mats or cushions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a bluish-green coloration due to the presence of a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically short, broad, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Maasia glauca is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
