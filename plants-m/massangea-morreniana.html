                    <h1>Massangea morreniana</h1>
<p>Massangea morreniana, commonly known as the Morren's massangea, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Massangea morreniana is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
