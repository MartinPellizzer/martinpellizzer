                    <h1>Mimosa pauciseta</h1>
<p>Mimosa pauciseta, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Mimosa pauciseta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive foliage.</p>
