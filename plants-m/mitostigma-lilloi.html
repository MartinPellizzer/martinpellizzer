<p>Mitostigma lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its botanical features include a root system that attaches to the host tree, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Mitostigma lilloi is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
