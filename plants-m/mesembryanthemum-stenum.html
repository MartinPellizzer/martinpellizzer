<p>Mesembryanthemum stenum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in conditions where other plants would struggle.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum stenum is also known for its rapid growth and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
