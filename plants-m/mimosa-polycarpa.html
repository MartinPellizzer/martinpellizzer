                    <h1>Mimosa polycarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa polycarpa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and educational settings.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and its ability to attract pollinators make it both ecologically and botanically significant.</p>
