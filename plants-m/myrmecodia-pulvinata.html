                    <h1>Myrmecodia pulvinata</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia pulvinata, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that form a distinctive honeycomb-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food while benefiting from their pest control services. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
