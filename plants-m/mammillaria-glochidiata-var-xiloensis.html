                    <h1>Mammillaria glochidiata var. xiloensis</h1>
<p>Mammillaria glochidiata var. xiloensis, commonly known as the Xiloense Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a thick, water-storing stem.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
