                    <h1>Medicago polymorpha var. coronata</h1>
<p>Medicago polymorpha var. coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
