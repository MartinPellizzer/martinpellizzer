                    <h1>Mikania stereodes</h1>
<p>Mikania stereodes, commonly known as the creeping mikania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white to pale brown seeds. Mikania stereodes is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
