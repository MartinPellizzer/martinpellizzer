                    <h1>Mimosa polydidyma</h1>
<p>Mimosa polydidyma, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Mimosa polydidyma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
