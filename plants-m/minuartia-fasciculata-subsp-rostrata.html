<p>Minuartia fasciculata subsp.</p>
<p>rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, forming dense, cushion-like structures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its frost-resistant properties and efficient water retention.</p>
