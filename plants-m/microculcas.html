                    <h1>Microculcas</h1>
<p>Microculcas, commonly known as stonecrops, are succulent plants belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. These plants typically have a low-growing, spreading habit and produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Native to temperate and alpine regions, they are often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Microculcas are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
