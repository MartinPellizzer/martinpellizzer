<p>Minuartia viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>confertiflora, commonly known as the sticky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, clustered inflorescences and viscid (sticky) leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
