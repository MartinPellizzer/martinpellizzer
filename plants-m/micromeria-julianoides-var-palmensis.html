                    <h1>Micromeria julianoides var. palmensis</h1>
<p>Micromeria julianoides var. palmensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme drought conditions.</p>
