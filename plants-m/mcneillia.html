                    <h1>Mcneillia</h1>
<p>Mcneillia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Mcneillia species are often shrubs or subshrubs, with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
