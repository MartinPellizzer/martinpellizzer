<p>Micropiper blandum, commonly known as the slender pipevine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique, often tubular or heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive, veiny structure that aids in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its association with certain butterfly species, as its leaves are consumed by the larvae of the common wood-nymph butterfly.</p>
