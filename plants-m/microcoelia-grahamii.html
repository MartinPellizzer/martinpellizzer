<p>Microcoelia grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's microcoelia, is a small, flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white blooms. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water.</p>
<p>Microcoelia grahamii is often found in rocky soils and is a rare, endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
