                    <h1>Mephitidia obscura</h1>
<p>Mephitidia obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Mephitidia obscura is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
