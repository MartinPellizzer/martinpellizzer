                    <h1>Medicago × varia f. ambigua</h1>
<p>Medicago × varia f. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous medick, is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Medicago sativa and Medicago lupulina, exhibiting a mix of traits from both parent species. The plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, often thriving in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its morphology and genetic variability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
