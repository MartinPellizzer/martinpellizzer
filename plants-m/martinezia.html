<p>Martinezia, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Martinezia species are adapted to arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>They play a role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees.</p>
