<p>Maxillaria hastulata, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Maxillaria hastulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
