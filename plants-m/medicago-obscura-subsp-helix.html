<p>Medicago obscura subsp.</p>
<p>helix, commonly known as the helix medick, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Medicago species.</p>
