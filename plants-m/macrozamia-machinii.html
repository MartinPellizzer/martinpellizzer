<p>Macrozamia machinii, commonly known as the Macarthur cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Macrozamia machinii is a slow-growing species that can live for over a century, making it a symbol of resilience in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
