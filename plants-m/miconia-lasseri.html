                    <h1>Miconia lasseri</h1>
<p>Miconia lasseri, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that eventually develop into bright orange, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in jams and juices.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
