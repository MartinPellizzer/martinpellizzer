                    <h1>Mibora minima var. elongata</h1>
<p>Mibora minima var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated mibora, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, often arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is valued for both its aesthetic and ecological roles in its native habitat.</p>
