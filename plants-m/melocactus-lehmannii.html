                    <h1>Melocactus lehmannii</h1>
<p>Melocactus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's melon cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of white, woolly spines that help protect it from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces a single, large, yellow flower that blooms at the top of the stem, typically during the dry season. Its thick, fleshy stem stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Melocactus lehmannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
