<p>Machaerina complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf machaerina, is a small shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Machaerina complanata is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, growing in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
