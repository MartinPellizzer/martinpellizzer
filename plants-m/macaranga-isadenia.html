<p>It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release silky, cotton-like fibers, which are used in traditional textiles and as stuffing material.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation projects.</p>
