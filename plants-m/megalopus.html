                    <h1>Megalopus</h1>
<p>Megalopus, commonly known as the giant water bug, is a member of the family Belostomatidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and powerful, raptorial front legs used for capturing prey. The plant-like appearance of its nymphal stage often leads to confusion with aquatic plants. Megalopus thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes aquatic nymphs that undergo several molts before emerging as winged adults.</p>
