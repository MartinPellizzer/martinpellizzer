                    <h1>Mammillaria fuauxiana</h1>
<p>Mammillaria fuauxiana, commonly known as the Fuaux's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Mammillaria fuauxiana thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert and semi-desert climates.</p>
