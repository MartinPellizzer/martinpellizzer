                    <h1>Miconia elaeodendrum</h1>
<p>Miconia elaeodendrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
