                    <h1>Monanthotaxis nimbana</h1>
<p>Monanthotaxis nimbana, commonly known as the cloud forest tree, is a species native to the humid tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of its cloud forest habitat.</p>
