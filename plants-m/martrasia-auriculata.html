                    <h1>Martrasia auriculata</h1>
<p>Martrasia auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and sepals that resemble ears, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Martrasia auriculata is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
