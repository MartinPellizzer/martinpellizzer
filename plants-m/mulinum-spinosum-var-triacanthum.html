<p>Mulinum spinosum var. triacanthum, commonly known as the thorned mullein, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are lanceolate, serrated, and often have prominent spines along the edges, contributing to its defensive adaptations. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
