<p>Melaleuca perforata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>

The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Melaleuca perforata is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and sandy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
