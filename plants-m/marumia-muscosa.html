<p>Marumia muscosa, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a delicate and low-growing plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. This plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Marumia muscosa plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
