<p>Mollinedia calodonta, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
