                    <h1>Mickelopteris</h1>
<p>Mickelopteris, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Micropteridales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in leaf-like structures called strobila. Mickelopteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Mickelopteris are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
