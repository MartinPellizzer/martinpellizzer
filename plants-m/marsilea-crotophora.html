<p>Marsilea crotophora, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically submerged, with the upper surface bearing small, rounded lobes.</p>
<p>Marsilea crotophora produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by the development of small, bladder-like fruits.</p>
