                    <h1>Metalasia calcicola</h1>
<p>Metalasia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone metalasia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adaptations that reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Metalasia calcicola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, making it a common species in rocky and limestone-rich habitats.</p>
