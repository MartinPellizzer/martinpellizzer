                    <h1>Micromeria rupestris</h1>
<p>Micromeria rupestris, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its small size and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Micromeria rupestris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
