                    <h1>Mischospora efoliata</h1>
<p>Mischospora efoliata, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and serve as a food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
