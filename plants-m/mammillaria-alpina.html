<p>Mammillaria alpina, commonly known as the Alpine hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in small, tuberculate areoles that bear white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
