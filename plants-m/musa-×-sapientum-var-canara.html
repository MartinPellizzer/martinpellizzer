<p>Musa × sapientum var. canara, commonly known as the Canara banana, is a cultivar of the banana plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elongated, and curved fruit, which typically has a yellow or orange peel when ripe. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with a pseudostem formed by the tightly packed leaf sheaths. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit develops from the flowers and is typically harvested when the peel is fully yellow, indicating maturity.</p>
