                    <h1>Microula involucriformis</h1>
<p>Microula involucriformis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is adapted to efficiently absorb and store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Microula involucriformis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife.</p>
