                    <h1>Mariscus palustris</h1>
<p>Mariscus palustris, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a stout, cylindrical stem that is often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments.</p>
<p>Mariscus palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine.</p>
