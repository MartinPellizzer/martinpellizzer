                    <h1>Medusantha eriophylla</h1>
<p>Medusantha eriophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its growth pattern is slow and compact, often forming a rosette shape that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Medusantha eriophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
