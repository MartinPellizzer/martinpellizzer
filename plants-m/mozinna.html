<p>Mozinna, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Mozinna is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soil.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
