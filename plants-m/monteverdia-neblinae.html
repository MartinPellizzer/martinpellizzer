                    <h1>Monteverdia neblinae</h1>
<p>Monteverdia neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest monteverdia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its unique adaptations to the humid, misty environment include a thick cuticle to prevent water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Monteverdia neblinae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
