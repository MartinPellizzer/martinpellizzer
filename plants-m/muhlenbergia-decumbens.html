<p>Muhlenbergia decumbens, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces slender, branched inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Muhlenbergia decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes.</p>
