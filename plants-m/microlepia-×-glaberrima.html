                    <h1>Microlepia × glaberrima</h1>
<p>Microlepia × glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous microlepia, is a hybrid fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glabrous (smooth) fronds that are typically arching or drooping in habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
