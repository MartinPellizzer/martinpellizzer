                    <h1>Melocactus cremnophilus</h1>
<p>Melocactus cremnophilus, commonly known as the rock melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a single, prominent, ribbed areola that bears the flowers. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Melocactus cremnophilus is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions.</p>
