<p>Myrtus greggii, commonly known as Gregg's myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value comes from its aromatic foliage and showy blossoms.</p>
<p>Myrtus greggii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
