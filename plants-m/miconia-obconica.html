                    <h1>Miconia obconica</h1>
<p>Miconia obconica, commonly known as the broadleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Miconia obconica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
