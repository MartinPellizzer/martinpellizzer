<p>Microstegium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with finely net-veined patterns. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
