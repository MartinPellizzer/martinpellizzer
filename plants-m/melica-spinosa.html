                    <h1>Melica spinosa</h1>
<p>Melica spinosa, commonly known as the prickly grass or spinous melica, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sometimes hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings but also serves as a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
