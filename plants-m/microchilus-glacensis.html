<p>Microchilus glacensis, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant found in alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Microchilus glacensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other alpine flora.</p>
