                    <h1>Micrechites archboldianus</h1>
<p>Micrechites archboldianus, commonly known as the Archbold's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves rather than true foliage. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-parasite interactions.</p>
