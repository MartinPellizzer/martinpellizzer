                    <h1>Metaxya</h1>
<p>Metaxya, commonly known as the "buttercup tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most notably Metaxya rufa, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, and its palmate leaves. Metaxya species are often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
