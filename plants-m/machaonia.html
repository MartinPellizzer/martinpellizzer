<p>These plants are native to New Zealand and are characterized by their distinctive, silver-colored foliage. The leaves are often leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps them retain moisture in their native environment. Machaonia species typically grow in shaded, moist areas such as forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, adding a delicate touch to their natural habitat.</p>
