<p>Macrocarpaea illuminata, commonly known as the glowing nightshade, is a striking plant characterized by its bioluminescent properties.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, star-shaped flowers that emit a soft light, particularly at night, due to specialized luciferin-luciferase reactions. The plant has dark green, velvety leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its stems are sturdy and upright. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique glow, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens and as a novelty plant.</p>
