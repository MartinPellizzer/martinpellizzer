                    <h1>Mimosa oblonga</h1>
<p>Mimosa oblonga, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa oblonga is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms.</p>
