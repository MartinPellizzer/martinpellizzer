                            <h1>Medicago Ovalis</h1>
<p>Medicago ovalis is a small, drought-resistant legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the world. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded landscapes. This plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil restoration and sustainable agriculture. Its compact growth habit and deep root system help prevent soil erosion. Despite its modest appearance, Medicago ovalis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and improving land health.</p>
