<p>Moehnia, commonly known as the waterplantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. The plants typically have narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Moehnia species produce small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and they are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
