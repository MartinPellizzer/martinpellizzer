                            <h1>Moeroris Oxycoccifolia</h1>
<p>Rocky mountain snowberry, scientifically known as Moeroris oxycoccifolia, is a rare and hardy plant native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It thrives in cold, alpine environments where few other species can survive. This plant is characterized by its small, white berries that remain on the shrub throughout the winter, providing food for wildlife. Its ability to endure harsh conditions makes it an important part of the mountain ecosystem. Despite its resilience, it faces threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
