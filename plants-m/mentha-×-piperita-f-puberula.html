                    <h1>Mentha × piperita f. puberula</h1>
<p>Mentha × piperita f. puberula, commonly known as peppermint with pubescent leaves, is a cultivated variant of peppermint characterized by its densely hairy foliage.</p>
<p>This feature distinguishes it from the typical peppermint, which has smoother leaves. The plant is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Mentha piperita and Mentha × gracilis. It possesses the characteristic square, hollow stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves typical of the Mentha genus.</p>
<p>Its botanical traits make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal uses.</p>
