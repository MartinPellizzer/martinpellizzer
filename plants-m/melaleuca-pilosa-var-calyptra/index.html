                            <h1>Melaleuca Pilosa Var. Calyptra</h1>
<p>Melaleuca pilosa var. calyptra is a unique variant of the melaleuca genus native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and scrublands along the coast. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically white or pink and attract a variety of pollinators. Despite its resilience, it remains a relatively rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
