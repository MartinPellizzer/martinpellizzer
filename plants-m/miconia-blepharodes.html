<p>Miconia blepharodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Neotropical region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Miconia blepharodes is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
