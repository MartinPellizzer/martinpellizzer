                    <h1>Medicago tuberculata var. spinulosa</h1>
<p>Medicago tuberculata var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny medick, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The spiny bracts on its seed pods are a distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
