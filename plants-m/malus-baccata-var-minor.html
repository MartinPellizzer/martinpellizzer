                    <h1>Malus baccata var. minor</h1>
<p>Malus baccata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It features oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact size and seasonal interest.</p>
<p>This variety is more cold-hardy than the standard Malus baccata, making it suitable for a wider range of climates.</p>
