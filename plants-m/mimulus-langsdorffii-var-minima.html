<p>Mimulus langsdorffii var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf yellow monkeyflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It features delicate, spurred yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
