                    <h1>Maharanga griersonii</h1>
<p>Maharanga griersonii, commonly known as the Kauri tree, is a rare and ancient conifer native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree can grow up to 50 meters in height and has a lifespan that can exceed 1,000 years. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and historical logging, it is now critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
