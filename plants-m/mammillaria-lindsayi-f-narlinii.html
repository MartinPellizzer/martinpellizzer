                    <h1>Mammillaria lindsayi f. narlinii</h1>
<p>Mammillaria lindsayi f. narlinii, commonly known as the Lindsay's mammillaria, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a dense covering of white, woolly spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
