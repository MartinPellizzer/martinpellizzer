<p>Malaxis spiralis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Malaxis spiralis is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
