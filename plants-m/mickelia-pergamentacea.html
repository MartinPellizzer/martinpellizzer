                    <h1>Mickelia pergamentacea</h1>
<p>Mickelia pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped leaves that resemble parchment, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its slow growth and longevity make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Mickelia pergamentacea is classified as critically endangered.</p>
