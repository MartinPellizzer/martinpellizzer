                    <h1>Mildella</h1>
<p>Mildella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Mildella is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
