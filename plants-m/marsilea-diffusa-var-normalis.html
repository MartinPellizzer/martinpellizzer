                    <h1>Marsilea diffusa var. normalis</h1>
<p>Marsilea diffusa var. normalis, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential weed in ponds.</p>
