                    <h1>Mikania maritima</h1>
<p>Mikania maritima, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a trailing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
