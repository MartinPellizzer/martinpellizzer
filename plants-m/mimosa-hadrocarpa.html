                    <h1>Mimosa hadrocarpa</h1>
<p>Mimosa hadrocarpa, commonly known as the giant mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous tiny leaflets that fold shut when touched, a response known as thigmonastic movement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
