                    <h1>Medusorchis andamanica</h1>
<p>Medusorchis andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, elongated, and often curved inflorescence that bears pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the humid, shaded forest floor. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Medusorchis andamanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
