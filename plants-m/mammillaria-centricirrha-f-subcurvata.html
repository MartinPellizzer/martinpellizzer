                    <h1>Mammillaria centricirrha f. subcurvata</h1>
<p>Mammillaria centricirrha f. subcurvata, commonly known as the curled spine mammillaria, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a pale green to blue-gray body with prominent, curved spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny form. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by collectors for its unique morphology and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
