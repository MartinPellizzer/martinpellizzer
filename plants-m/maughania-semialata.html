                    <h1>Maughania semialata</h1>
<p>Maughania semialata, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a soft, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Maughania semialata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
