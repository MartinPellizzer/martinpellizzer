<p>Miconia borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. Miconia borinquensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
