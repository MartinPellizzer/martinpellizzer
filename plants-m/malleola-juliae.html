<p>Malleola juliae, commonly known as the Julia's malleola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often resembling those of orchids. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems that are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Malleola juliae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
