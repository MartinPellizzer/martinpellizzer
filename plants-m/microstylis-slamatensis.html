<p>Microstylis slamatensis, commonly known as the Slamat's microstylis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
