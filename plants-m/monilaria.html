                    <h1>Monilaria</h1>
<p>Monilaria, commonly known as the false morel, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Gyromitraceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, irregularly shaped caps that often resemble a brain or a sponge. They are typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. Monilaria species are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants.</p>
<p>However, some species, like Gyromitra esculenta, are toxic and should not be consumed.</p>
