<p>Macarthuria ephedroides, commonly known as the Australian ephedroid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ephedraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid regions of Australia and is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
