<p>Microcerasus prostrata f. tadshikistanica, commonly known as the Tadshikistan dwarf cherry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
