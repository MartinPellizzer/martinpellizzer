                    <h1>Mollugo glomerata</h1>
<p>Mollugo glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Mollugo glomerata is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
