<p>Melaleuca arcuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and grey. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Melaleuca arcuata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal regions.</p>
