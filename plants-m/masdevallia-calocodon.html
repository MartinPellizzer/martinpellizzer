<p>Masdevallia calocodon, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Masdevallia calocodon is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
