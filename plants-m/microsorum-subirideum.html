<p>Microsorum subirideum, commonly known as the red-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking contrast of light green and deep red veins. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, muddy habitats. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is also cultivated in aquariums and water gardens.</p>
