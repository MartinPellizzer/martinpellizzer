                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum catervum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum catervum, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments.</p>
