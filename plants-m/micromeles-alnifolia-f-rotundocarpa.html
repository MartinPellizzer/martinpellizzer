                    <h1>Micromeles alnifolia f. rotundocarpa</h1>
<p>Micromeles alnifolia f. rotundocarpa, commonly known as the round-fruited alderleaf, is a rare shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and distinctive fruiting structures. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, a feature that sets it apart from other members of the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
