                    <h1>Marsilea costulifera</h1>
<p>Marsilea costulifera, commonly known as water clover, is a aquatic fern native to Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, four-leaf clover-like floating leaves that are often used in ornamental ponds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, and it can form dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores into the water for propagation.</p>
<p>Marsilea costulifera is also valued for its ability to improve water clarity by filtering nutrients.</p>
