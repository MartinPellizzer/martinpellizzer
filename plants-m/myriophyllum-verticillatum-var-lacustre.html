                    <h1>Myriophyllum verticillatum var. lacustre</h1>
<p>Myriophyllum verticillatum var. lacustre, commonly known as watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with staminate and pistillate flowers occurring on separate plants. It is a perennial species that can form dense stands, influencing water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
