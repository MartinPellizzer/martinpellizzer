                            <h1>Metrosideros Polymorpha Var. Newellii</h1>
<p>Koa, scientifically known as Metrosideros polymorpha var. newellii, is a native Hawaiian tree that holds deep cultural and ecological significance. This iconic species is recognized for its vibrant red flowers and durable, high-quality wood that was traditionally used by Native Hawaiians. Despite its beauty and importance, koa faces threats from invasive species, habitat loss, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore koa populations across the Hawaiian Islands. The koa tree symbolizes strength, resilience, and the enduring connection between people and nature.</p>
