<p>Monteverdia psammophila, commonly known as the sandstone vine, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
