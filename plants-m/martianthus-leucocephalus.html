                    <h1>Martianthus leucocephalus</h1>
<p>Martianthus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Mars.</p>
<p>It features large, pale white blooms that open only at night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. The plant has adapted to the harsh Martian environment with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is highly specialized, capable of extracting moisture from the thin Martian soil.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is extremely difficult to cultivate outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
