<p>Malaxis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf malaxis, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique botanical features.</p>
