<p>Myriotheca, commonly known as the "thousand-seed" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that form compact clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Myriotheca species are native to regions of southern Africa, the Mediterranean, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
