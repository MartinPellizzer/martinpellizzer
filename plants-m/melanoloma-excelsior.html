                    <h1>Melanoloma excelsior</h1>
<p>Melanoloma excelsior, commonly known as the celestial twilight orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals that transition into a soft, luminous hue at the edges, resembling the colors of a sunset. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, mist-laden habitat. It blooms once a year during the late summer, producing a single, fragrant flower that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
