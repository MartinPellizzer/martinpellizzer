                <h1>Melaleuca costata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Melaleuca costata is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
