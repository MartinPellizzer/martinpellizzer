<p>Mystacidium trifurcum, commonly known as the three-branched liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinct, branching pattern that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its gametophyte stage is the dominant phase of its life cycle, and it reproduces via spores released from capsule-like structures.</p>
<p>Mystacidium trifurcum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
