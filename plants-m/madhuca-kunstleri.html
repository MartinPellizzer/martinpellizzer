<p>Madhuca kunstleri, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment.</p>
