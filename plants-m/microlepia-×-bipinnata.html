                    <h1>Microlepia × bipinnata</h1>
<p>Microlepia × bipinnata, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Microlepia sylvatica and Microlepia tenuifolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
