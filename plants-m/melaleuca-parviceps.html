                    <h1>Melaleuca parviceps</h1>
<p>Melaleuca parviceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
