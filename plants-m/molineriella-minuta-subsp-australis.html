<p>Molineriella minuta subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests eucalyptus trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can significantly impact the host's growth. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves wind-dispersed seeds that germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
