<p>Melinis inamoena, commonly known as white bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and panicles of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial in stabilizing soil.</p>
