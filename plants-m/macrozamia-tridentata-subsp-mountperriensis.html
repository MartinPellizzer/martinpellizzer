<p>Macrozamia tridentata subsp.</p>
<p>mountperriensis, commonly known as the Mount Perri cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Darling Range in Western Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate, making it adapted to the specific conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
