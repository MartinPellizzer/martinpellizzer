                    <h1>Matricaria balsamita</h1>
<p>Matricaria balsamita, commonly known as tansy, is an aromatic perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant contains compounds such as thymol and camphor, which contribute to its strong, minty fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings and requires careful handling.</p>
