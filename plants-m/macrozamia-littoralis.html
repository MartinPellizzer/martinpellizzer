                    <h1>Macrozamia littoralis</h1>
<p>Macrozamia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Macrozamia littoralis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
