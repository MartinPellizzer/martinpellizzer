                    <h1>Miconia membranacea</h1>
<p>Miconia membranacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple-red berries. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are also known for their thick, membranous texture, which contributes to its common name.</p>
