                    <h1>Microgramma dictyophylla</h1>
<p>Microgramma dictyophylla, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, supporting the growth of its compound leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
