                    <h1>Myrmecostylum tortuosum</h1>
<p>Myrmecostylum tortuosum, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate, branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its distinctive, often meandering thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in various environments. It is typically found on rocks and tree bark in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
