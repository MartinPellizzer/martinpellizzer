                    <h1>Miconia capillipes</h1>
<p>Miconia capillipes, commonly known as the featherleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a feathery texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. Miconia capillipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
