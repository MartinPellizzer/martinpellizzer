                    <h1>Muraltia horrida</h1>
<p>Muraltia horrida, commonly known as the spiny huito, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Muraltia horrida is also valued for its ornamental potential and use in traditional medicine.</p>
