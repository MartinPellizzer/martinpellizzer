                    <h1>Matayba scrobiculata</h1>
<p>Matayba scrobiculata, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat.</p>
