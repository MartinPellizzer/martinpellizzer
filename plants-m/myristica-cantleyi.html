                    <h1>Myristica cantleyi</h1>
<p>Myristica cantleyi, commonly known as the Malabar nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain a single, kidney-shaped seed. The seeds are valued for their aromatic oils, similar to nutmeg, and are used in traditional medicine and perfumery.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
