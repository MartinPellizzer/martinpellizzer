                    <h1>Molinia minor</h1>
<p>Molinia minor, commonly known as lesser moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and heaths.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and plays an important role in stabilizing peatland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Molinia minor is often found in open, sunny areas and is a characteristic component of coastal and upland vegetation.</p>
