                    <h1>Melica decipiens</h1>
<p>Melica decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Melica decipiens is often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its name "deceptive grass" may refer to its resemblance to other grass species, which can make it challenging to identify without close examination.</p>
