<p>Melaleuca similis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a greyish-green upper surface and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>Melaleuca similis is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
