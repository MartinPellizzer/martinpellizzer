<p>Myosurus minimus subsp.</p>
<p>montanus, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
