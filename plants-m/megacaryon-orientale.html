<p>Megacaryon orientale, commonly known as the oriental giant fern, is a large fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
