                    <h1>Macrozamia spiralis var. diplomera</h1>
<p>Macrozamia spiralis var. diplomera, commonly known as the Diplomera cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, feathery leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn red or brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
