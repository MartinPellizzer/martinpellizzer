<p>Malnerega malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Malnerega malabarica is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
