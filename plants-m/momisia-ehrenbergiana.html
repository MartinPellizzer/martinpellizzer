                    <h1>Momisia ehrenbergiana</h1>
<p>Momisia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
