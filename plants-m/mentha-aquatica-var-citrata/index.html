                            <h1>Mentha Aquatica Var. Citrata</h1>
<p>Citron mint, scientifically known as Mentha aquatica var. citrata, is a unique hybrid plant that combines the refreshing qualities of mint with the citrusy aroma of lemons. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources. Its leaves emit a bright, zesty scent that sets it apart from other mint varieties, making it a popular choice for culinary and aromatic uses. Despite its appeal, it is relatively rare in cultivation, requiring specific conditions to flourish. This plant not only adds a refreshing touch to herbal teas and dishes but also serves as a valuable addition to natural ecosystems.</p>
