<p>Microparacaryum, commonly known as the small paracaryum, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. They are characterized by their small, delicate leaves and rhizomatous growth habit. Microparacaryum species often form dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role in aquatic ecosystems and their use in ornamental aquatic gardening.</p>
