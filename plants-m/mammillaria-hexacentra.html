<p>Mammillaria hexacentra, commonly known as the six-armed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, tuberculate body, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters over time.</p>
<p>Mammillaria hexacentra is well-suited for cultivation in well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
