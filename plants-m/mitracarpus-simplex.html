                    <h1>Mitracarpus simplex</h1>
<p>Mitracarpus simplex, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiky seed pods that release seeds when disturbed. It has adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
