                    <h1>Melinis minutiflora var. biaristata</h1>
<p>Melinis minutiflora var. biaristata, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wet or poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
