<p>Mimosa petiolaris, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant has small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its stems are slender and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and well-developed.</p>
<p>Mimosa petiolaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive foliage.</p>
