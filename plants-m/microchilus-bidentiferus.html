<p>Microchilus bidentiferus, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetlands and pond margins. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Microchilus bidentiferus plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
