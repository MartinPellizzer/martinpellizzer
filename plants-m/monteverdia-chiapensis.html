<p>Monteverdia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas monteverdia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Monteverdia chiapensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
