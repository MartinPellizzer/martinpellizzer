<p>Micranthemum glomeratum, commonly known as water thyme, is a small aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are often less than 1 cm in length, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
