<p>Mucuna lamii, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Mucuna lamii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility.</p>
