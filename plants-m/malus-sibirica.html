<p>Malus sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are edible but often used in jams and preserves rather than eaten raw. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Malus sibirica is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
