                    <h1>Miconia bourgaeana</h1>
<p>Miconia bourgaeana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native habitats.</p>
