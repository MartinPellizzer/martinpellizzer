                    <h1>Mazus saltuarius</h1>
<p>Mazus saltuarius, commonly known as the rock mazus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to poor, well-drained soils makes it a hardy species suited to rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Mazus saltuarius is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
