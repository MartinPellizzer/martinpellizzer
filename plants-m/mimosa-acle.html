                    <h1>Mimosa acle</h1>
<p>Mimosa acle, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its rapid leaf movement is a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sunlight.</p>
