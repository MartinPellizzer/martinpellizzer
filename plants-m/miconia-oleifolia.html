                    <h1>Miconia oleifolia</h1>
<p>Miconia oleifolia, commonly known as the oilleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
