The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or loamy soils, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
