                    <h1>Medicago elegans var. incisa</h1>
<p>Medicago elegans var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf medick, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>The variety incisa is distinguished by its narrower leaflets compared to the typical form of Medicago elegans.</p>
