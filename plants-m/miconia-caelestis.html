                <h1>Miconia caelestis</h1>
<p>Miconia caelestis, commonly known as the sky blue miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, blue-violet bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, which are edible but have a mild, sour taste. Miconia caelestis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
