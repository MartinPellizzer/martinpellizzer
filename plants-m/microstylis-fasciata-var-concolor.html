<p>Microstylis fasciata var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, unstriped stems and leaves, which set it apart from other varieties within the Microstylis genus.</p>
