<p>Microlepia biserrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that give the plant its common name. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
