                    <h1>Micrampelis paniculata</h1>
<p>Micrampelis paniculata, commonly known as the panicle cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red berries. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or ascending, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Micrampelis paniculata is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xerophytic landscapes.</p>
