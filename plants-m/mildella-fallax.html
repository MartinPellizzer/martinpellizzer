                    <h1>Mildella fallax</h1>
<p>Mildella fallax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, which is one of its distinguishing features. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Mildella fallax is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
