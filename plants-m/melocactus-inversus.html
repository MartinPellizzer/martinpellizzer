<p>Melocactus inversus, commonly known as the Upside-Down Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, with spines that grow downward and a globular shape that resembles an inverted sphere. The plant has a dense, woolly covering of white, soft hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow or orange, appear at the top of the plant and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Melocactus inversus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
