                    <h1>Melocactus nanus</h1>
<p>Melocactus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf melon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, ribbed stem that is typically greenish-yellow with prominent areoles from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces small, showy yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
