<p>Miconia leadentata, commonly known as the velvetleaf miconia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of velvety, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries.
