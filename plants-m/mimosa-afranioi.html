                    <h1>Mimosa afranioi</h1>
<p>Mimosa afranioi, commonly known as the African sensitive plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within its cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique movement and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
