                    <h1>Malaxis urbana</h1>
<p>Malaxis urbana, commonly known as the urban ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Malaxis urbana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
