                    <h1>Medicago truncatula f. sinistrorsa</h1>
<p>Medicago truncatula f. sinistrorsa, commonly known as the left-handed or sinistrorsa medick, is a variant of the common medick, a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive left-handed coiling of the stems, a trait that sets it apart from the standard form. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers are typical of the genus Medicago.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment.</p>
