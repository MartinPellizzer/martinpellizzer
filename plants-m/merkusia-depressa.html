The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
