<p>Melocactus ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's melon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, globose stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Melocactus ernestii is often cultivated as a decorative cactus due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
