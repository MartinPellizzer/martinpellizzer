                    <h1>Melaleuca lateriflora var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Melaleuca lateriflora var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale, fibrous inner layer. The plant produces small, white to cream-colored flowers in spikes, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a pointed tip, giving it its specific epithet "acutifolia.".</p>
<p>This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
