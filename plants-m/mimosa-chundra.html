<p>Mimosa chundra, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Mimosa chundra is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate flowers.</p>
