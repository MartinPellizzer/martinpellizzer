<p>Marcgravia strenua, commonly known as the climbing bromeliad, is a species native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a vine-like plant that uses its aerial roots to climb trees, often forming dense foliage along its host. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped inflorescences that are typically green or yellowish, with showy bracts. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help in capturing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Marcgravia strenua is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting various epiphytic organisms.</p>
