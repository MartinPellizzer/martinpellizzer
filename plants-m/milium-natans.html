                    <h1>Milium natans</h1>
<p>Milium natans, commonly known as floating millet, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, clustered inflorescences that produce numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its stems float on the water surface. Milium natans is typically found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it contributes to water clarity by absorbing excess nutrients.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
