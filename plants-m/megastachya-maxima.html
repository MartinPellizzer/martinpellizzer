<p>Megastachya maxima, commonly known as the giant spike rush, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers that are arranged in a single, terminal cluster. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Megastachya maxima is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
