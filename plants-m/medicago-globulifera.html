                    <h1>Medicago globulifera</h1>
<p>Medicago globulifera, commonly known as the globular vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, globular seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a feature that aids in its reproductive strategy. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Medicago globulifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
