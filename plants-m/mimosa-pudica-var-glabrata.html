                    <h1>Mimosa pudica var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Mimosa pudica var. glabrata, commonly known as the sensitive plant or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, yellow, bean-like pods that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
