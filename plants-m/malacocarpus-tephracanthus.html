The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base and female cones emerging from the upper part of the stem. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
