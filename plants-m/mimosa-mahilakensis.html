<p>Mimosa mahilakensis, commonly known as the Indian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf movement, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation.</p>
