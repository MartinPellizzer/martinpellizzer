                    <h1>Macrozamia corallipes</h1>
<p>Macrozamia corallipes, commonly known as the coral-stemmed cycad, is a unique and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that resembles coral, hence its common name, and its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are spirally arranged. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Macrozamia corallipes is a slow-growing, long-lived species that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
