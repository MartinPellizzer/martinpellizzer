                    <h1>Melaleuca alilateralis var. crassa</h1>
<p>Melaleuca alilateralis var. crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved paperbark, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It produces small, bottle-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or cream, which attract nectar-feeding insects.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
