<p>Monanthes silensis, commonly known as the Silense silversword, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Monanthes silensis is considered endangered and is protected in conservation programs.</p>
