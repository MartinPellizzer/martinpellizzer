<p>Microlepia strigosa var. mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui sword fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Moloka ªi. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, finely textured appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
