<p>Minuartia nuttallii subsp.</p>
<p>fragilis, commonly known as the fragile sand-flower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as dunes or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
