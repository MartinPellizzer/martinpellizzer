<p>Mauria heterophylla var. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's mauvebush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet-colored flowers. The species exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has two different leaf forms depending on environmental conditions, with juvenile leaves being larger and more lobed than mature ones.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
