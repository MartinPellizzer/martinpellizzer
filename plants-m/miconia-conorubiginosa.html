                    <h1>Miconia conorubiginosa</h1>
<p>Miconia conorubiginosa, commonly known as the red-leaved miconia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright red or orange when young, turning darker as they mature. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
