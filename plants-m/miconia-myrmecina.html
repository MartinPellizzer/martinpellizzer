                    <h1>Miconia myrmecina</h1>
<p>Miconia myrmecina, commonly known as the antplant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense foliage and the presence of specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and other pests, forming a mutualistic relationship. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
