                    <h1>Myrmecodia tuberosa</h1>
<p>Myrmecodia tuberosa, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection and nutrients. The plant's structure consists of a swollen, tuberous stem covered in a dense network of leaf-like structures. Its leaves are small, waxy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and wasps.</p>
