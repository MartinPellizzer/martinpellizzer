                    <h1>Misanteca aritu</h1>
<p>Misanteca aritu, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and elusive plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink petals that resemble translucent tissue, giving it an ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing in shaded, moss-covered areas. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Misanteca aritu is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
