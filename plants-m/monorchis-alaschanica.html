                    <h1>Monorchis alaschanica</h1>
<p>Monorchis alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan single-seed grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. The plant produces a single seed per spikelet, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other grass species. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
