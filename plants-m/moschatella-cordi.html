                    <h1>Moschatella cordi</h1>
<p>Moschatella cordi, commonly known as the heartleaf moschatella, is a rare aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, acidic water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
