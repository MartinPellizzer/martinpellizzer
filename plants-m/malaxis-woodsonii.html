                    <h1>Malaxis woodsonii</h1>
<p>Malaxis woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded forest habitats, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal relationships, which are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
