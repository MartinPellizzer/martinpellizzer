<p>Meliosma simplicifolia subsp.</p>
<p>rigida, commonly known as the rigid leaf meliosma, is a rare shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often densely pubescent, giving the plant a distinctive fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are usually arranged oppositely on the stems, and the plant has a woody base with a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
