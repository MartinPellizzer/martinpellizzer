                    <h1>Mimosa abstergens</h1>
<p>Mimosa abstergens, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that rapidly fold when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its botanical name, *Mimosa abstergens*, refers to its ability to "clean" or "remove" itself from stimuli, a trait linked to its sensitive leaf movements.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
