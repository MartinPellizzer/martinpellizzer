                    <h1>Metastelma freemanii</h1>
<p>Metastelma freemanii, commonly known as the freeman's metaphytes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
