                    <h1>Musschia</h1>
<p>Musschia, commonly known as the common moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the division Bryophyta.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. Musschia has a simple structure consisting of leaf-like structures and stem-like rhizoids that anchor it to surfaces. It reproduces through spores released from small, capsule-like structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in ecosystems.</p>
