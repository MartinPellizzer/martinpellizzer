                    <h1>Melaleuca corrugata</h1>
<p>Melaleuca corrugata, commonly known as the rough-leaved melaleuca, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or heathlands.</p>
<p>Melaleuca corrugata is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
