<p>Millingtonia ferruginea, commonly known as the red cedar or red gum, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dark green, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Millingtonia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>
