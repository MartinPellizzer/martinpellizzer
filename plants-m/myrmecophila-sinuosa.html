<p>Myrmecophila sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous myrmecophila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.
