                    <h1>Micropolypodium pseudotrichomanoides</h1>
<p>Micropolypodium pseudotrichomanoides, commonly known as the false trichomanes, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid tropical and subtropical environments. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a dense arrangement of small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of fine, hairy tissue.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
