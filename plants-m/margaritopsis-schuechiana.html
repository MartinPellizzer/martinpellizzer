<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
