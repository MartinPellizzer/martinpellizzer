                    <h1>Morocarpus foliosus</h1>
<p>Morocarpus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy morocarpus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Morocarpus foliosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
