                    <h1>Misanteca foveolata</h1>
<p>Misanteca foveolata, commonly known as the Florida panther lily, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in areas with high water tables.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
