<p>Memecylon melindense, commonly known as the Melindense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Memecylon melindense is of interest in ecological and conservation studies.</p>
