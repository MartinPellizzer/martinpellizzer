                    <h1>Mimosa microcephala var. mituensis</h1>
<p>Mimosa microcephala var. mituensis, commonly known as the dwarf mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a characteristic known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
