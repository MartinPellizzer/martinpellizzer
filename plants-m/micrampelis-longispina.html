                    <h1>Micrampelis longispina</h1>
<p>Micrampelis longispina, commonly known as the long-spined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. The plant's unique feature is its long, spiny stems, which help it cling to its host and deter herbivores. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis to supplement its energy needs.</p>
<p>Micrampelis longispina plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
