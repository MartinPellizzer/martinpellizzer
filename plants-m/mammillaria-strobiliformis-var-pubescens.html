<p>Mammillaria strobiliformis var. pubescens, commonly known as the fuzzy ball cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of small, ribbed stems that form a spherical shape, covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which emerge from the areoles. Its fuzzy coating helps reduce water loss and provides protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
