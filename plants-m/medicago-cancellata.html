                    <h1>Medicago cancellata</h1>
<p>Medicago cancellata, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to white in color, and its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Medicago cancellata is widely used in forage agriculture and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
