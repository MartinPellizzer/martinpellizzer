<p>Mollugo tenella, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are small, opposite, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny yellow flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
