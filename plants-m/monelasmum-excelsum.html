                    <h1>Monelasmum excelsum</h1>
<p>Monelasmum excelsum, commonly known as the tall mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing shelter for small animals and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
