                    <h1>Maireana spongiocarpa</h1>
<p>Maireana spongiocarpa, commonly known as the spongefruit, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. These fruits are adapted to be dispersed by animals, contributing to its survival in dry ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
