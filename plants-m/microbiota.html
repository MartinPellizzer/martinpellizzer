                    <h1>Microbiota</h1>
<p>Microbiota, commonly known as the community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in the health and function of plants.</p>
<p>These microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, and other microbes that colonize the roots, leaves, and soil surrounding the plant. They contribute to nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and plant growth promotion through various biochemical interactions. The composition of microbiota can vary depending on environmental conditions and the plant species.</p>
<p>Understanding these botanical aspects is essential for sustainable agriculture and ecological research.</p>
