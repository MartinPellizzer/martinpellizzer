                    <h1>Mentha × verticillata f. pilosa</h1>
<p>Mentha × verticillata f. pilosa, commonly known as woolly water mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and its ability to thrive in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which are typical of the Mentha genus. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential weed.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Mentha × verticillata f. pilosa make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>
