                    <h1>Meringium dimidiatum</h1>
<p>Meringium dimidiatum, commonly known as the half-moon lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure.</p>
<p>It consists of a dense, leathery thallus with a pale to yellowish-green coloration, often forming irregular, lobed patches. The plant's morphology includes a central layer of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in forest ecosystems.</p>
