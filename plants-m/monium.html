                    <h1>Monium</h1>
<p>Monium, commonly known as the "liverworts," is a group of non-vascular plants that belong to the division Marchantiophyta.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their simple structure and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. Monium species often have a thalloid body, which is a flat, leaf-like structure that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. They play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitats for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to their ancient lineage, they offer valuable insights into the early evolution of land plants.</p>
