<p>Mikania rivularis, commonly known as river mikania, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>The fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
