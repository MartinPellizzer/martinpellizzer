The plant produces yellowish or pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Mundulea striata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
