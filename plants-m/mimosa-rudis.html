<p>Mimosa rudis, commonly known as the sea mimosas, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Mimosa rudis is also known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold shut when disturbed.</p>
