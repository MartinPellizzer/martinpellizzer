<p>Mentha aquatica var. acutifolia, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and stream banks in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Mentha aquatica var. acutifolia is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
