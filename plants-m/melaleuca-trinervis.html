<p>Melaleuca trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled appearance, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Melaleuca trinervis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators.</p>
