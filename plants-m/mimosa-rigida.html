<p>Mimosa rigida, commonly known as the rigid mimosa, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Mimosa rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique movement characteristics.</p>
