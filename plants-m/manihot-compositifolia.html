<p>Manihot compositifolia, commonly known as the composite-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive compound leaves, which are composed of multiple leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are edible and have been used traditionally for their starchy content.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other arrowroot species due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
