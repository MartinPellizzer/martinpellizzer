                    <h1>Myrica cerifera var. arborescens</h1>
<p>Myrica cerifera var. arborescens, commonly known as the wax myrtle or bayberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, wax-coated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It is also valued for its hard, waxy fruit, which has been used historically for candle-making.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
