                    <h1>Meiogyne macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Meiogyne macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Meiogyne macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
