<p>Magnolia granbarrancae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre magnolia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, providing a striking contrast to its fragrant blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
