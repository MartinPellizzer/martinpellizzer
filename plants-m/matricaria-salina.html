<p>Matricaria salina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk flowers, which resemble those of the common daisy. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Matricaria salina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
