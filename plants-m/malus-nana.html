                    <h1>Malus nana</h1>
<p>Malus nana, commonly known as the dwarf apple tree, is a compact deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are often used in cooking or preserves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small spaces.</p>
