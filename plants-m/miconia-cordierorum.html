<p>Miconia cordierorum, commonly known as the beauty leaf or evergreen miconia, is a tropical shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to red or purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
