                    <h1>Microstrobos</h1>
<p>Microstrobos, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves. Microstrobos species produce spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are often clustered at the tips of their stems. They are often mistaken for mosses due to their low-growing appearance, but they are more closely related to ferns.</p>
<p>Microstrobos plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
