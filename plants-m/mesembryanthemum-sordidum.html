                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum sordidum</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty ice plant, is a succulent flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It produces seeds in small capsules, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry regions.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum sordidum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
