<p>Microsorum pteropus, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lily-like appearance. This plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded, humid conditions. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Microsorum pteropus is popular in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
