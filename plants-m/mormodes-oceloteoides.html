                    <h1>Mormodes oceloteoides</h1>
<p>Mormodes oceloteoides, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that resembles a small horn. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological role in the region's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The orchid's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its leaves are broad and waxy to reduce water loss.</p>
