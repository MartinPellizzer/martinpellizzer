                    <h1>Malus betulifolia</h1>
<p>Malus betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bark that resembles that of a birch tree, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart apples in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Malus betulifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest.</p>
