<p>Mucuna ferox, commonly known as the devil's bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, often hairy, pods that contain numerous seeds. The plant produces a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fallows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Mucuna ferox is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
