                    <h1>Mimosa sapindoides</h1>
<p>Mimosa sapindoides, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a deciduous shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique sensitivity to touch and its ability to regenerate from cuttings make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
