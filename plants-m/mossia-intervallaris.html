                    <h1>Mossia intervallaris</h1>
<p>Mossia intervallaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and its unique inflorescence of greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its reproductive system relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
