<p>Mammillaria verticealba, commonly known as the white-tipped hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a gray-green body covered in short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, woolly fruits. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
