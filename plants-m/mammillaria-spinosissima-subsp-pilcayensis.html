<p>Mammillaria spinosissima subsp.</p>
<p>pilcayensis, commonly known as the spiny mammillaria, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its compact form. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
