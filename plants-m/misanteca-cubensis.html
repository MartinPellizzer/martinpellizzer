<p>Misanteca cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and grows on the branches of various host trees, such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
