                    <h1>Myosurus apetalus var. borealis</h1>
<p>Myosurus apetalus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with reduced flowers, characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-poor, well-drained soils in high-altitude or polar ecosystems.</p>
