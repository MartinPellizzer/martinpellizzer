                    <h1>Mimosa cataractae</h1>
<p>Mimosa cataractae, commonly known as the mountain mimosa, is a shrub native to the rocky hills of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a trait known as thigmonasty.</p>
<p>Mimosa cataractae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
