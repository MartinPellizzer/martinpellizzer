                <h1>Manfreda scabra</h1>
<p>Manfreda scabra, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late summer. Manfreda scabra is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
