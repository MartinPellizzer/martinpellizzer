                    <h1>Mesembryanthemum filiforme</h1>
<p>Mesembryanthemum filiforme, commonly known as the slender ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Mesembryanthemum filiforme is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
