                    <h1>Melocactus robustispinus</h1>
<p>Melocactus robustispinus, commonly known as the robust spiny cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and prominent spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are usually yellow or orange and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The cactus is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates due to its drought tolerance and slow growth rate.</p>
