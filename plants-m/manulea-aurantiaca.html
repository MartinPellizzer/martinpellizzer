                    <h1>Manulea aurantiaca</h1>
<p>Manulea aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-stemmed manulea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are typically orange or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow, often blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Manulea aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
