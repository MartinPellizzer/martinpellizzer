                    <h1>Mimosa hystricosa</h1>
<p>Mimosa hystricosa, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a reaction triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid leaf movement has made it a popular subject in botanical studies and a symbol of sensitivity in various cultures.</p>
