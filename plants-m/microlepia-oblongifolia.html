                    <h1>Microlepia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Microlepia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, leathery fronds that often form a dense, cascading structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
