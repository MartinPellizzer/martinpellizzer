<p>Monotropa squamiformis, commonly known as the squamose ghostplant, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that obtains nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations with fungi. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, giving it a ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with decaying organic matter.</p>
