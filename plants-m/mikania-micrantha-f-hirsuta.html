<p>Mikania micrantha f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Mikania, is a variant of the invasive Mikania micrantha species.</p>
<p>It is a fast-growing vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often spreading aggressively in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it a significant ecological concern in many areas.</p>
