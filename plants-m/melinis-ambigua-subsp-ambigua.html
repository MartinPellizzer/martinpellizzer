<p>Melinis ambigua subsp.</p>
<p>ambigua, commonly known as broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and the edges of ponds, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
