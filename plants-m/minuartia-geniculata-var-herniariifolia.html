                    <h1>Minuartia geniculata var. herniariifolia</h1>
<p>Minuartia geniculata var. herniariifolia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It is typically found in mountainous regions and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
