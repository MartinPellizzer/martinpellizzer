<p>Macrostelia, commonly known as the "broad-leaved waterplantain," is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, flat leaves that often float on the water surface or are submerged. They typically have small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and their roots are often rhizomatous. Macrostelia species are found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers.</p>
