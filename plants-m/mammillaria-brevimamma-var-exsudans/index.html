<p>Exsudant mammillaria, scientifically known as Mammillaria brevimamma var. exsudans, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. This plant is distinguished by its small, globular shape and the presence of white, woolly spines that give it a soft appearance. It is particularly noted for its ability to exude a sticky, milky substance from its areoles, a feature that sets it apart from other cacti. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts who appreciate its beauty and ecological significance. Careful attention to its specific growing conditions is essential to ensure its survival in both its natural habitat and in captivity.</p>
