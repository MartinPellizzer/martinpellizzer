<p>Mesembryanthemum emarginatum, commonly known as the margined ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation.</p>
