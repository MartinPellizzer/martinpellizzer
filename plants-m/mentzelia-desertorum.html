<p>Mentzelia desertorum, commonly known as the desert blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Mentzelia desertorum is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed or degraded habitats, making it an important pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
