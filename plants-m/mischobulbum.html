<p>Mischobulbum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its botanical features include a mat-forming growth habit and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Mischobulbum is often used in ecological studies to understand plant adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
