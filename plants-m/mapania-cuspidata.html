                    <h1>Mapania cuspidata</h1>
<p>Mapania cuspidata, commonly known as the slender mapania, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
