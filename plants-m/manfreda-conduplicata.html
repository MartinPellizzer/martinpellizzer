<p>Manfreda conduplicata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat.</p>
