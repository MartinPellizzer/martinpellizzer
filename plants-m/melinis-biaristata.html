<p>Melinis biaristata, commonly known as the silky grass or silky millet, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
