<p>Minuartia senneniana, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together form a composite organism. This plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces.
