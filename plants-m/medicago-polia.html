                    <h1>Medicago polia</h1>
<p>Medicago polia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. Medicago polia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its ability to improve soil fertility makes it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
