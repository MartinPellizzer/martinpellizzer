                    <h1>Mimosa multipinna</h1>
<p>Mimosa multipinna, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical traits make it both an interesting subject for scientific study and a visually appealing ornamental plant.</p>
