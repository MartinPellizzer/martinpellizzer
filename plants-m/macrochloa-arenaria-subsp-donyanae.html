<p>Macrochloa arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>donyanae, commonly known as the Donyi grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
