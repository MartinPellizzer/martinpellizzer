<p>Myosurus apetalus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fine, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, lacking showy petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
