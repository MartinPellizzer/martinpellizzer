                    <h1>Mimosa pigra var. dehiscens</h1>
<p>Mimosa pigra var. dehiscens, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a shrub native to the savannas of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by the closing mechanism of its stipules. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphological features and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
