                    <h1>Micromeles paucinervia</h1>
<p>Micromeles paucinervia, commonly known as the small-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits the canopy of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches to host trees through haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, leathery leaves with a reduced number of veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role, it plays an important part in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
