                    <h1>Mariscus riparius var. gillii</h1>
<p>Mariscus riparius var. gillii, commonly known as the Gill's marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist, often waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Mariscus riparius.</p>
