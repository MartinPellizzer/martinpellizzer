                    <h1>Melampyrum cristatum var. ronnigeri</h1>
<p>Melampyrum cristatum var. ronnigeri, commonly known as the Ronniger's nodding touch-me-not, is a flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is found in parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
