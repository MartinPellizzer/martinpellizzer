                    <h1>Mimosa pratincola</h1>
<p>Mimosa pratincola, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Mimosa pratincola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
