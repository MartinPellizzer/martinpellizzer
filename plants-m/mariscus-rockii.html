                    <h1>Mariscus rockii</h1>
<p>Mariscus rockii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Mariscus rockii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
