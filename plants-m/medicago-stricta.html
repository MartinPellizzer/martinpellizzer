                    <h1>Medicago stricta</h1>
<p>Medicago stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is sometimes used as forage for livestock.</p>
<p>Medicago stricta is also a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens.</p>
