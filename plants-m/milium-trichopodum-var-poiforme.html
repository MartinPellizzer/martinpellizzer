                    <h1>Milium trichopodum var. poiforme</h1>
<p>Milium trichopodum var. poiforme, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental gardening for its soft, textured foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
