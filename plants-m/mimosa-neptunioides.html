                    <h1>Mimosa neptunioides</h1>
<p>Mimosa neptunioides, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Mimosa neptunioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movements and attractive foliage.</p>
