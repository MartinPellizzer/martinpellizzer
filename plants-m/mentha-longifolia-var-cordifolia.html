                    <h1>Mentha longifolia var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Mentha longifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as creeping mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are broadly ovate to cordate in shape, with a serrated margin and a strong, aromatic scent. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorls along the stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its menthol content and refreshing aroma.</p>
