                    <h1>Millettia piscidia</h1>
<p>Millettia piscidia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
