                    <h1>Mucuna horrida</h1>
<p>Mucuna horrida, commonly known as the horrid velvet tamarind, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell and are typically dispersed by animals or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Mucuna horrida is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
