<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous inner layer, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in coastal heathlands and dunes.</p>
<p>Melaleuca aquilonia is known for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it a common component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
