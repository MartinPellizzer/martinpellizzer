                            <h1>Medicago Minima Var. Hirsuta</h1>
<p>Medicago minima var. hirsuta is a small, hardy legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the world. This variety is known for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its hairy leaves and compact form make it a valuable plant for erosion control and livestock forage. Often overlooked, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects. Despite its modest appearance, it contributes significantly to soil health and biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
