                    <h1>Merrillanthus</h1>
<p>Merrillanthus, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has no known leaves or stems, with its entire structure consisting of a single, translucent, waxy flower that appears to float in the air. Merrillanthus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Its unique biology and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
