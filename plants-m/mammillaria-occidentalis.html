<p>Mammillaria occidentalis, commonly known as the western hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
