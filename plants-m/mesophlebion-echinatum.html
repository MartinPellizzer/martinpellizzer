                    <h1>Mesophlebion echinatum</h1>
<p>Mesophlebion echinatum, commonly known as the spiny phlebion, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Mesophlebion echinatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
