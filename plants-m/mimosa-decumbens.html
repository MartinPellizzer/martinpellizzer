<p>Mimosa decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mimosa, is a low-growing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fern-like leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Mimosa decumbens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments.</p>
