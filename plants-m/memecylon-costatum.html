<p>Memecylon costatum, commonly known as the rough-leaved memecylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often rough to the touch due to their hairy surfaces. It produces small, clustered flowers with showy petals that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal in the natural habitat.</p>
