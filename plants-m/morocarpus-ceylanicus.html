                    <h1>Morocarpus ceylanicus</h1>
<p>Morocarpus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon morocarpus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Morocarpus ceylanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
