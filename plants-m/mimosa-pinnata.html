                    <h1>Mimosa pinnata</h1>
<p>Mimosa pinnata, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Mimosa pinnata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
