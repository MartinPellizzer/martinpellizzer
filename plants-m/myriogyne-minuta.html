<p>Myriogyne minuta, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>Myriogyne minuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through natural filtration.</p>
