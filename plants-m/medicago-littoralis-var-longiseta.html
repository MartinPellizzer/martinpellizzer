                    <h1>Medicago littoralis var. longiseta</h1>
<p>Medicago littoralis var. longiseta, commonly known as the coastal medick, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salty, wind-blown environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in stabilizing coastal dunes and improving soil fertility.</p>
