                    <h1>Mikania megalophylla</h1>
<p>Mikania megalophylla, commonly known as giant leaf mikania, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, which are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is non-native.</p>
