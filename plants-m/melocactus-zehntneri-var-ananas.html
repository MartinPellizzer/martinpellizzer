                    <h1>Melocactus zehntneri var. ananas</h1>
<p>Melocactus zehntneri var. ananas, commonly known as the pineapple melocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, globular shape and a crown of short, spiny stems that resemble the leaves of a pineapple. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
